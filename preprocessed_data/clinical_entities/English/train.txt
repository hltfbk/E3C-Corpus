We O
report O
a O
case O
A O
6 O
day O
old O
female O
neonate O

referred O
to O
our O
center O
on O
account O
of O
bilateral B-ety
eversion I-ety
of I-ety
the I-ety
upper I-ety

. O

The O
baby O
was O
a O
full O

product O
of O
an O
uneventful O
pregnancy O
delivered O
via O
spontaneous O
vaginal O
route O
. O

There O
was O
no O
use O
of O
instrumentation O
and O
she O
cried O
spontaneously O
at O
birth O
. O

Further O
information O
gathered O
from O
the O
referral O
note O
revealed O
that O
the O
child O
has O
been O
on O
gentamycin O
eye O

and O
systemic O
antibiotics O
but O
with O
no O
apparent O
improvement O
6 O
days O
prior O
to O
presentation-the O
reason O
for O
referral O
. O

Examination O
at O
presentation O
revealed O
an O
otherwise O
normal O
child O
with O
bilateral B-ety
complete I-ety
eversion I-ety
of I-ety
the I-ety
upper I-ety
eyelids I-ety
. O

There O
were O
marked O
chemosis B-ety
bilaterally I-ety
worst O
in O
the O

Both O
eyes O
were O
double-everted O
using O
lid O
retractor O
in O
order O
to O
assess O
the O
conditions O
of O
the O
two O
eyeballs O
which O
were O
both O
found O
to O
be O
normal O
. O

Attempt O
at O
repositioning O
the O
eyelids O
was O
unsuccessful O
because O
of O
the O
marked O
chemosis B-ety
. O

The O
child O
was O
admitted O
into O
Special O
baby O

unit O
( O
SBCU O
) O
of O
our O
hospital O
to O
facilitate O
close O
monitoring O
. O

She O
was O
also O
reviewed O
by O
the O
pediatrician O
and O
no O
other O
abnormality O
was O
found O
. O

Perforated O
transparent O
catellar O

On O
the O
3rd O
day O
of O
admission O
, O
the O
chemosis B-ety
on I-ety
the I-ety

However O
, O
on O
the O
5th O
day O
of O
admission O
, O
both O
chemosis B-ety
had O
resolved O
totally O
with O

Both O
eyeballs O
were O
normal O
. O

A O
38 O
- O
year-old O
man O
presented O
with O
a O
seven O
month O
history O
of O
progressively O
worsening O
bilateral O
knees B-ety
pain I-ety
with O
associated O
swelling B-ety
. O

The O
pain B-ety
was O
present O
when O
the O
patient O
was O
at O
rest O
, O
and O
worsened O
when O
the O
legs O
was O
bearing O
weight O
, O
thus O
restricting O
his O
walking O
to O
short O
distances O
. O

His O
knees O
had O
become O
increasingly O
swollen O
. O

He O
was O
otherwise O
fit O
and O
well O
. O

His O
medical O
history O
was O
unremarkable O
and O
he O
was O
only O
taking O
a O
paracetamol O
, O
codeine O
and O
anti-inflammatory O
drugs O
for O
the O
pain O
. O

Upon O
examination O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
seen O
to O
have O
visibly O
swollen B-ety
popliteal I-ety
fossa I-ety
and O
marked O
quadriceps O
wasting O
of O
his O
right O
lower O
limb O
. O

On O
palpation O
, O
the O
masses O
was O
hard O
, O
mobile O
, O
well O
defined O
, O
and O
measured O
0.5 O
- O
04 O
cm O
. O

The O
swelling B-ety
was O
non-tender O
and O
there O
were O
no O
associated O
skin O
changes O
. O

He O
could O
fully O
extend O
his O
knee O
, O
but O
flexion O
was O
restricted O
to O
only O
110 O
degrees O
. O

There O
was O
a O
McMurray O
test O
proved O
equivocal O
and O
no O
ligamentous O
instability O
. O

An O
examination O
of O
the O
patient O
’ O
s O
hip O
revealed O
no O
abnormality O
. O

A O
plain O
radiograph O
of O
the O
patient O
’ O
s O
knees O
revealed O
multiple O
calcific O
densities O
within O
the O
soft O
tissues O
surrounding O
it O
on O
the O
right O
one O
. O

Although O
some O
of O
these O
appeared O
to O
lie O
within O
the O
capsule O
, O
the O
majority O
appeared O
to O
be O
outside O
of O
it O
, O
and O
a O
solitary O
image O
on O
the O
left O
knee O
. O

These O
appearances O
were O
thought O
to O
be O
consistent O
with O
idiopathic O
tumoral B-ety
calcinosis I-ety
. O

However O
, O
to O
further O
scrutinize O
these O
calcifications B-ety
, O
a O
magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
( O
MRI O
) O
scan O
was O
recommended O
. O

It O
showed O
an O
extensive O
thickening O
of O
the O
patient O
’ O
s O
synovium O
, O
multiple O
intraarticular O
calcific O
and O
ossific O
loose O
bodies O
, O
and O
large O
calcified O
bursal O
extensions O
. O

These O
findings O
were O
thought O
to O
be O
consistent O
with O
very O
extensive O
bilateral O
synovial B-ety
chondromatosis I-ety
. O

The O
patient O
’ O
s O
blood O
tests O
were O
normal O
: O
C-reactive O
protein O
5 O
mg O
/ O
l O
and O
the O
phosphate O
calcium O
balance O
without O
errors O
. O

A O
two-stage O
procedure O
was O
planned O
following O
the O
findings O
of O
the O
MRI O
scan O
. O

The O
first O
stage O
was O
arthroscopy O
, O
which O
was O
able O
to O
note O
Grade O
IV O
osteoarthritis B-ety
alongside O
florid O
synovial B-ety
chondromatosis I-ety
in O
the O
lateral O
compartment O
of O
the O
right O
knee O
. O

There O
were O
multiple O
loose O
bodies O
within O
this O
compartment O
and O
nodules O
were O
fixed O
to O
the O
synovium O
. O

On O
the O
left O
one O
, O
we O
found O
an O
isolated O
synovial B-ety
metaplasia I-ety
in O
the O
subvastus O
quadriceps-sparing O
. O

A O
synovectomy O
with O
debridement O
and O
excision O
of O
these O
bodies O
was O
thus O
performed O
. O

The O
second O
stage O
involved O
an O
open O
exploration O
of O
the O
patient O
’ O
s O
popliteal O
fossa O
. O

Multiple O
calcified O
masses O
were O
found O
, O
all O
enclosed O
in O
bursal O
sacs O
. O

They O
were O
lateral O
to O
the O
semimembranosus O
at O
the O
level O
of O
the O
oblique O
popliteal O
ligament O
. O

All O
the O
masses O
were O
excised O
. O

A O
histological O
review O
confirmed O
our O
diagnosis O
of O
synovial B-ety
chondromatosis I-ety
. O

The O
sections O
showed O
nests O
of O
chondrocytes O
with O
focal O
ossification O
and O
focally O
attenuated O
synovium O
overlying O
the O
nodules O
. O

After O
the O
operation O
, O
the O
patient O
underwent O
functional O
rehabilitation O
sessions O
focusing O
on O
quadriceps O
strengthening O
, O
with O
a O
daily O
exercise O
regime O
to O
supplement O
this O
. O

He O
recovered O
well O
and O
ten O
weeks O
after O
the O
operation O
, O
has O
regained O
his O
right O
knee O
’ O
s O
full O
range O
of O
movement O
with O
flexion O
increased O
to O
130 O
degrees O
, O
which O
is O
equal O
to O
that O
of O
his O
left O
knee O
. O

An O

during O
the O
first O
four O
pregnancies O

Her O
first O
pregnancy O
in O
1999 O
was O
unknown O
until O
approximately O
25th O
gestational O
weeks O
with O
fatal O
intrauterine B-ety
growth I-ety

. O

The O
following O
two O
pregnancies O
were O
terminated O
on O
parental O
request O
after O
a O
chorion O
villus O
biopsy O
revealed O
the O
mutation O
causing O
late O
familial B-ety
hyperinsulinemic I-ety
hypoglycemia I-ety
. O

During O
the O
fourth O
pregnancy O
, O
in O
which O
the O
fetus O
also O
had O
the O
mutation O
, O
serial O
ultrasound O
examinations O
showed O
a O
small O
fetus O
with O
appropriate O
growth O
. O

At O
birth O
the O
girl O
was O
small O
for O
gestational O
age O
. O

She O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
neonatal O
special O
care O
unit O
due O
to O
low B-ety
blood I-ety
glucose I-ety
and O
intravenous B-ety

, O
her O
condition O
deteriorated O
with O
signs O
of O
an O
abdominal B-ety
catastrophe I-ety
indicating O
necrotizing B-ety
enterocolitis I-ety
. O

After O
two O
laparotomies O
- O
both O
confirming O
necrotizing B-ety
enterocolitis I-ety
- O
the O
child O
died O
8 O
days O
after O
birth O
. O

In O
the O
following O
two O
pregnancies O
Sandostatin O
LAR O

One O
child O
carried O
the O

A O
2 O
- O
year-old O
Japanese O
boy O
recently O
presented O
to O
our O
department O
with O
a O
chief O
complaint O
of O
neck B-ety
swelling I-ety
. O

Physical O
examination O
revealed O
bilateral O
tonsillitis B-ety
and O
swelling B-ety
of O
the O
left O
posterior O
pharyngeal O
wall O
. O

Emergency O
neck O
computed O

angiography O
showed O
a O
contrast-enhanced O
abscess O
cavity O
posterior O
to O
the O
left O
retropharyngeal O
space O
, O
and O
a O
low-density O
area O
surrounded O
by O
an O
area O
without O
contrast O
enhancement O
in O
the O
posterior O
neck O
. O

The O
latter O
was O
suspected O
to O
be O
a O
deep O
neck O
infection B-ety
secondary O
to O
a O
retropharyngeal B-ety
abscess I-ety
. O

After O
surgery O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
a O
retropharyngeal B-ety
abscess I-ety
and O
concurrent O
cystic B-ety
lymphangioma I-ety
. O

The O
lesions B-ety
improved O
after O
intraoral O
incision O
and O
drainage O
, O
and O
administration O
of O
antibiotics O
. O

An O
80 O
year-old O
Caucasian O
male O
was O
diagnosed O
at O
an O
outside O
institution O
with O
Barrett's B-ety
esophagus I-ety
with I-ety
high I-ety
grade I-ety
dysplasia I-ety
and O
presented O
to O
our O
institution O
for O
therapy O
. O

The O
patient O
underwent O
endoscopic O
mucosal O
resection O
using O
a O
band O
ligation O
technique O
of O
an O
area O
of O
nodularity O
within O
the O
Barrett B-ety
esophagus I-ety
. O

Microscopic O
examination O
demonstrated O
extensive O
Barrett B-ety
esophagus I-ety
with I-ety
high-grade I-ety
dysplasia I-ety
as O
well O
as O
a O
second O
tumor O
which O
was O
morphologically O
different O
from O
the O
surrounding O
high-grade B-ety
dysplasia I-ety
and O
which O
was O
positive O
for O
S O
- O
100 O
, O
HMB O
45 O
and O
Melan-A O
on O
immunohistochemistry O
, O
consistent O
with O
melanoma B-ety
. O

Further O
workup O
of O
the O
patient O
demonstrated O
multiple B-ety
radiologic I-ety
lesions I-ety
consistent O
with O
metastases B-ety
. O

Molecular O
studies O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
melanoma B-ety

positive O
for O
the O
1799T O

A O
( O
V600E O
) O
mutation O
in O
the O
BRAF O

. O

The O
overall O
features O
of O
the O
tumor B-ety
were O
most O
consistent O
with O
metastatic B-ety
melanoma I-ety
occurring O
in O
a O
background O
of O
Barrett O
esophagus O
with O
high-grade O
dysplasia O

A O
37 O

year-old O
Arabian O
woman O
presented O
with O
12 O
months O
of O
progressive O
Cushing's B-ety
syndrome-like I-ety
symptoms O
. O

Biochemical O
evaluation O
confirmed O
adrenocorticotropic B-ety
hormone I-ety
- I-ety
dependent I-ety
Cushing's I-ety
syndrome I-ety
. O

However O
, O
the O
anatomical O
site O
of O
her O
excess O
adrenocorticotropic O
hormone O
secretion O
was O
not O
clearly O
delineated O
by O
further O
investigations O
. O

Magnetic O
resonance O
imaging O
of O
our O
patient's O
pituitary O

failed O
to O
demonstrate O
the O
presence O
of O
an O
adenoma B-ety
. O

Spiral O
computed O

of O
her O
chest O
only O
revealed O
the O
presence O
of O
a O
non-specific O
7 O
mm O
lesion O
in O
her O
left O
inferobasal O
lung O
segment O
. O

Our O
patient O
was O
commenced O
on O
medical O
treatment O
with O
ketoconazole O
and O
metyrapone O
to O
control O
the O
clinical O
features O
associated O
with O
her O
excess O
cortisol O
secretion O
. O

Despite O
initial O
normalization O
of O
her O
urinary O
free O
cortisol O
excretion O
rate O
, O
levels O
began O
to O
rise O
eight O
months O
after O
commencement O
of O
medical O
treatment O
. O

Repeated O
imaging O
of O
her O
pituitary O
gland O
, O
chest O

again O
failed O
to O
clearly O
localize O
a O
source O
of O
her O
excess B-ety
adrenocorticotropic I-ety
hormone I-ety
secretion I-ety
. O

The O
bronchial O
nodule O
was O
stable O
in O
size O
on O
serial O
imaging O
and O
repeatedly O
reported O
as O
having O
a O
nonspecific O
appearance O
of O
a O
small O
granuloma B-ety
or O
lymph O
node O
. O

We O
re-explored O
the O
treatment O
options O
and O
endorsed O
our O
patient's O
favored O
choice O
of O
resection O
of O
the O
bronchial O
nodule O
, O
especially O
given O
that O
her O
symptoms O
of O
cortisol O
excess O
were O
difficult O
to O
control O
and O
refractory O
. O

Subsequently O
, O
our O
patient O
had O
the O
bronchial O
nodule O
resected O
. O

The O
histological O
appearance O
of O
the O
lesion O
was O
consistent O
with O
that O
of O
a O
carcinoid B-ety
tumor I-ety
and O
immunohistochemical O
analysis O
revealed O
that O
the O
tumor O
stained O
strongly O
positive O
for O
adrenocorticotropic O
hormone O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
removal O
of O
the O
lung B-ety
lesion I-ety
resulted O
in O
a O
normalization O
of O
our O
patient's O
24 O
