were O
normal O
. O

Thoracic O
radiography O
showed O
a O
large O
cervical O
opacity O
roughly O
round O

The O
right O
and O
left O
vascular O
axes O
of O
the O
neck O
( O
carotid O
artery O

The O
retrosternal O
part O
of O
the O
goiter O
was O
released O
using O
the O
finger O
by O
the O
same O
incision O
. O

Both O
recurrent O
laryngeal O
nerves O
( O
RLN O
) O
were O
not O
identified O
because O
of O
the O
hemorrhage B-ety
. O

One O
parathyroid O
gland O
was O
accidently O
devascularized O
and O
was O
autotransplanted O
to O
the O
ipsilateral O
sternocleidomastoid O
muscle O

postoperative O
period O
, O
the O
patient O
developed O
hemodynamic B-ety
collapse I-ety
requiring O
the O
introduction O
of O
dobutamine O
. O

After O
48 O
hours O
of O
hemodynamic O
support O
, O
the O
blood O
pressure O
stabilized O

year-old O
woman O
came O
to O
Department O
of O
Fertility O
, O
Endocrinology O
and O
Reproduction O
at O
Saiful O
Anwar O
public O
Hospital O
and O
consulted O
that O
she O
has O
not B-ety
menstruated I-ety
since O
5 O
years O
ago O
( O
28 O
years O
old O
) O
. O

Her O
initial O
menarche O
was O
at O
the O
age O
of O
14 O
years O
and O
it O
is O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
normal O
growth O
of O
a O
child O
at O
her O
age O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
a O
regular O
menstrual O
period O
of O
5 O
- O
7 O
days O
, O
she O
replaced O
the O
pads O
for O
2 O
- O
3 O
times O
/ O
day O
, O
and O
had O
no O
menstrual B-ety
pain I-ety
. O

The O
patient O
has O
a O
history O
of O
injective O
contraceptive O
that O
was O
done O
every O
once O
a O
month O
in O
2010 O
, O
and O
after O
the O
injection O
, O
she O
menstruated O
for O
two O
months O
and O
then O
it O
stopped O
. O

Based O
on O
clinical O
examination O
and O
a O
physical O
examination O
, O
the O
patient O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
secondary B-ety
amenorrhea I-ety
. O

Investigations O
that O
were O
used O
are O
ultrasonography O
, O
thorax O
X-ray O
and O
CT O
Scan O
Head O
. O

Ultrasonography O
and O
thorax O
X-Ray O
showed O
that O
patient O
is O
suspected O
to O
have O
right B-ety
pleural I-ety
effusion I-ety
. O

CT-Scan O
examination O
showed O
that O
bilateral O
ethmoidal O
sinusitis O
and O
pituitary O
gland O
was O
within O
normal O
limits O
. O

The O
treatment O
plan O
in O
this O
patient O
is O
P O
test O
therapy O
with O
Prothyra O
1x10 O
mg O
for O
7 O
days O
, O
with O
control O
on O
2 O
weeks O
after O
the O
use O
. O

P O
test O
showed O
a O
negative O
result O
, O
because O
after O
14 O
days O
of O
progesterone O
consumption O
the O
prothyra O
is O
not O
bleeding O
. O

The O
treatment O
is O
followed O
by O
a O
E O

P O
test O
( O
Estrogen O
+ O
Progesterone O
) O
with O

days O
and O
an O
addition O
of O
Progesterone O
1x10 O
mg O
on O
12th O
- O
21st O
days O
, O
while O
the O
control O
was O
performed O
one O
week O
after O
the O

runs O
out O
. O

Based O
on O
the O
E O

so O
it O
was O
necessary O
to O
do O
hysteroscopy O

year-old O
male O
was O
referred O
to O
the O
gastroenterology O
clinic O
for O
incidental O
findings O
of O
severe O
chronic B-ety
pancreatitis I-ety
on O
cross-sectional O
imaging O
but O
no O
associated O
symptoms O
of O
pancreatitis B-ety
. O

He O
had O
presented O
to O
the O
emergency O
department O
for O
abdominal B-ety
pain I-ety
consistent O
with O
prior O
episodes O
of O
renal B-ety
colic I-ety
. O

Computed O

scan O
confirmed O
the O
presence O
of O
renal B-ety
calculi I-ety
that O
passed O
with O
conservative O
management O
. O

An O
incidental O
finding O
on O
the O
imaging O
showed O
marked O
pancreatic B-ety
atrophy I-ety
with O
multiple O
sub-centimeter O
calcifications O
consistent O
with O
severe O
chronic B-ety
pancreatitis I-ety
. O

Remarkably O
, O
he O
did O
not O
report O
having O
any O
symptoms O
associated O
with O
pancreatic B-ety
insufficiency I-ety
including O
epigastric B-ety
pain I-ety
, O
vomiting B-ety
, O
steatorrhea B-ety
and O
weight O
loss O
. O

He O
denied O
having O
any O
prior O
episodes O
of O
acute B-ety
pancreatitis I-ety
and O
had O
no O
history O
of O
alcohol O
use O
. O

His O
laboratory O
tests O
were O
all O
within O
normal O
range O
, O
including O
complete O
blood O
count O
, O
liver O
function O
tests O
, O
amylase O
and O
lipase O
. O

His O
family O
history O
was O
significant O
as O
his O
father O
had O
an O
isolated O
episode O
of O
pancreatitis B-ety
which O
required O
abdominal O
surgery O
. O

Magnetic O
resonance O
cholangiopancreatography O
( O
MRCP O
) O
showed O
severe O
parenchymal O
atrophy O
and O
pancreatic O
ductal O
stones O
with O
ductal O
dilation O
to O
9mm O
. O

Due O
to O
his O
young O
age O
and O
atypical O
presentation O
, O
he O
was O
referred O
for O
genetic O
testing O
and O
counselling O
. O

He O
underwent O
genetic O
testing O
for O
various O
genes O
known O
to O
cause O
hereditary B-ety
pancreatitis I-ety
: O
CASR O
, O
CFTR O
, O
CTRC O
, O
PRSS1 O

He O
tested O
positive O
for O
homozygous O
variant O
of O
SPINK1 O
( O
N34S O
) O
mutation O
. O

Reflex O
testing O
of O
at-risk O
relatives O
confirmed O
that O
both O
of O
his O
parents O
were O
heterozygous O
carriers O
of O
the O
same O
SPINK1 O
( O
N34S O
) O
mutation O
and O
a O
review O
of O
their O
extended O
pedigree O
revealed O
that O
they O
were O
distant O
cousins O
. O

Given O
his O
asymptomatic O
clinical O
course O
, O
he O
remains O
under O
close O
follow-up O
without O
requiring O
any O
specific O
treatment O
for O
pancreatic B-ety
insufficiency I-ety
. O

Due O
to O
the O
severity O
of O
pancreatitis B-ety
noted O
on O
imaging O
and O
long O
expected O
lifespan O
, O
he O
was O
counselled O
about O
the O
increased O
risk O
of O
pancreatic O
malignancy O
and O
is O
undergoing O
regular O
cross-sectional O
imaging O
for O
the O
detection O
and O
prevention O
of O

Before O
starting O
the O
procedure O
, O
the O
urethra O
was O
dilated O

; O
at O
first O
, O
the O
tumor B-ety
location O
was O
specified O
by O
cystoscopy O
. O

Then O
, O
it O
was O
resected O
by O
monopolar O
cautery O
from O
superficial O
to O
deeper O
parts O
with O
removal O
of O
the O
muscle O
layers O
. O

Proper O
bleeders O
were O
taken O
and O
three O

Foley O
catheter O
was O
applied O
for O
a O
continuous O
irrigation O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
transferred O
to O
the O
recovery O
room O
with O
complete O
stability O
. O

The O
histopathology O
slides O
show O
a O
well-defined O
mass O
composed O
of O
bland O
looking O
spindle O
cells O
. O

Subsequent O
immunohistochemistry O
( O
IHC O
) O
was O
done O
which O
showed O
diffuse O
immunoreactivity O
for O
S100 O
, O
but O
other O
markers O
including O
smooth O
muscle O
actin O
( O
SMA O
) O
, O

were O
negative O
. O

Ki67 O
was O
2 O
- O
3% O
, O
so O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
schwannoma O
was O
confirmed O
. O

Then O
, O
the O
neck O
, O
abdomen O
, O
pelvic O
and O
chest O
computed O
tomography O
( O
CT O
) O
scans O
were O
done O
that O
were O
normal O
. O

Brain O
and O
spine O
MRI O
and O
physical O
examination O
showed O
no O
evidence O
of O
other O
schwannoma O
or O
evidence O
of O
neurofibromatosis B-ety
. O

She O
had O
no O
history O
of O
neurofibromatosis B-ety
in O
her O
family O
. O

Skin O
examination O
was O
normal O
and O
had O
no O
café O
au O

. O

She O
was O
not O
a O
case O
of O
von B-ety
Recklinghausen I-ety
disease I-ety
. O

Male O
infant O
9.5 O
month O
old O
was O
examined O
in O
the O
emergency O
department O
of O
our O
hospital O
because O
of O
an O
empty B-ety
scrotum I-ety
and O
the O
ipsilateral O
testis O
lying O
in O
a O
high O
iliac O
crest O
position O
. O

With O
the O
increase O
in O
intrabdominal O
pressure O
[ O
crying O
etc O
. O
] O
there O
was O
an O
ever-increasing O
swelling B-ety
with O
spiral O
course O
from O
the O
groin O
to O
ipsilateral O
iliac O
crest O
. O

On O
clinical O
examination O
, O
a O
reducible O
mass O
was O
present O
in O
the O
right O
ileac O
crest O
. O

The O
swelling B-ety
looked O
like O
a O
spigelian B-ety
hernia I-ety
[ O

] O
. O

However O
no O
abdominal O
wall O
defect O
could O
be O
palpated O
at O
that O
area O
. O

Moreover O
the O
ipsilateral O
scrotum O
was O
empty O
and O
the O
testis O
could O
be O
palpated O
with O
difficulty O
lying O
in O
a O
high O
inguinal O
position O
. O

Ultrasonography O
showed O
a O
loop O
of O
herniated O
small O
bowel O
and O
an O
undescended B-ety
testis I-ety
on I-ety
the I-ety
right I-ety
. O

At O
operation O
, O
under O
general O
anesthesia O
, O
an O
extended O
transverse O
inguinal O
incision O
was O
made O
. O

Upon O
entering O
the O
inguinal O
canal O
a O
large O
hernia O
sac O
was O
identified O
. O

This O
followed O
a O
course O
through O
the O
superficial O
inguinal O
ring O
, O
extended O
upwards O
to O
the O
anterior O
abdomninal O
wall O
below O
the O
subcutaneous O
plane O
and O
was O
fixed O
in O
the O
area O
of O
the O
right O
iliac O
crest O
. O

We O
noticed O
that O
the O
hernia O
orifice O
was O
in O
a O
higher O
than O
normal O
position O
5 O
cm O
from O
the O
pubic O
bone O
. O

This O
bulk O
was O
easily O
reduced O
back O
to O
the O
abdomen O
along O
with O
an O
ipsilateral O
mobile O
intravaginal O
testis O
. O

After O
careful O
isolation O
of O
the O
sac O
at O
a O
length O
of O
3 O
cm O
the O
ipsilateral O
testis O
was O
isolated O
. O

The O
vas O
and O
the O
vessels O
were O
intravaginal O
, O
the O
gubernaculum O
was O
fixed O
in O
an O
ectopic O
position O
and O
the O
dorsal O
inguinal O
wall O
was O
lax O
. O

We O
removed O
the O
large O
sac O
after O
separating O
the O
vas O
and O
vessels O
and O
the O
testis O
. O

Moreover O
we O
strengthened O
the O
dorsal O
inguinal O
wall O
, O
fixated O
the O
testis O
in O
a O
subdartos O
pouch O
and O
closed O
the O
wound O
. O

Patient O
stayed O
for O
a O

. O

The O
patient O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
CML B-ety
. O

She O
received O
a O
chemotherapy O
protocol O
made O
of O
hyperalkalinisation O
, O
allopurinol O
, O
hydroxyurea O
and O
a O
treatment O
based O
on O
imatinib O
at O
the O
dose O
of O
400mg O
per O
day O
. O

Patient O
achieved O
complete O
hematological O
remission O
at O
three O
months O
and O
complete O
cytogenetic O
remission O
at O
12 O
months O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
readmitted O
into O
our O
pediatric O
department O
with O
complains O
of O
severe B-ety
headache I-ety
, O
vomiting B-ety
, O
pain B-ety
and O
bilateral B-ety
visual I-ety
loss I-ety
since O
three O
days O
. O

On O
examination O
, O
patient O
was O
afebrile O
and O
appeared O
pale O
. O

Blood O
pressure O
was O
100 O
/ O
60mm O

minute O
. O

There O
was O
no O
lymphadenopathy O
and O
the O
nervous O
system O
examination O
was O
normal O
. O

Intraocular O
muscle O
testing O
was O
normal O
; O
however O
, O
there O
was O
an O
exophthalmia B-ety
in O
both O
eyes O
. O

The O
pupil O
was O
sluggish O
to O
react O
to O

. O

Fundoscopy O
revealed O
bilateral O
stade O
III O
disc O
edema O
and O
hemorrhages B-ety
of I-ety
the I-ety
retina I-ety
. O

She O
underwent O
a O
brain O
computed O

with O
the O
suspicion O
of O
leukemic O
involvement O
or O
any O
other O
intracranial O
event O
( O
cerebral O
edema O
) O
; O
however O
, O
nothing O
was O
found O
. O

A O
subsequent O
bone O

exam O
showed O
no O
morphologic O
or O
molecular O
evidence O
of O
CML O
or O
acute O
leukemia O
. O

Cytological O
evaluation O
of O
cerebrospinal O
fluid O
( O
CSF O
) O
was O
also O
negative O
. O

The O
patient O
had O
no O
other O
known O
pathology O
that O
could O
be O
held O
responsible O
for O
retina O
edema O
. O

We O
suggested O
that O
it O
was O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
imatinib O
so O
its O
administration O
was O
temporary O
interrupted O
. O

The O
patient O
was O
put O
on O
an O
anti-edema O
therapy O
( O
mannitol O
, O
dexamethasone O
) O
. O

However O
, O
few O
months O
later O
, O
the O
patient O
presented O
in O
the O
emergency O

of O
headaches B-ety
accompanied O
with O
weakness B-ety
of I-ety
extremities I-ety
and O

revealed O
subdural B-ety
chronic I-ety
hematoma I-ety
and O
a O
serpenginous O
gyriform O
enhancement O
around O
the O
contusion O
in O
the O

in O
a O
WBC O
count O
of O
11000cells O

The O
diagnosis O
of O
extramedullary B-ety
isolated I-ety
CNS I-ety
blast I-ety
crises I-ety
( O
lymphoid O
type O
) O
was O
based O
on O
the O
presence O
of O

in O
CSF O
( O
confirmed O
by O
flow O

) O
. O

The O
patient O
received O
a O
high-dose O
systemic O

chemotherapy O
and O
intrathecal O
therapy O
( O
methotrexate O
, O
arabinoside O

after O
finishing O
systemic O
chemotherapy O
and O
physical O
therapy O
; O
however O
, O
the O

microscopical O
finding O
, O
the O
final O
diagnosis O
was O
periodontal B-ety
disease I-ety
associated O
with O
a O
proliferative O
non-neoplastic O
lesion B-ety
. O

The O
patient O
was O
referred O
to O
a O
specialized O
dental O
surgeon O
and O
underwent O
periodontal O
therapy O
including O
surgical O
procedures O
. O

After O
that O
, O
according O
to O
follow-up O
with O
the O
patient O
, O
there O
were O
no O
signs O
of O
disease O
remission O
. O

The O
lesion B-ety
increased O
in O
size O
, O
although O
the O
patient O
did O
not O
complain O
of O
any O
symptoms O
. O

A O
second O
biopsy O
was O
performed O
and O
the O
microscopic O
features O
again O
showed O
a O
rich O
inflammatory B-ety
infiltrate I-ety
with O
mononuclear O
cells O
and O
histiocytic O
cells O
, O
characterized O
by O
pale O
histiocytes O
with O
lobed O
nuclei O
, O
resembling O
a O
bean O
. O

A O
varying O
number O
of O
eosinophils O
also O
were O
observed O
, O
without O
any O
evidence O
of O
atypical O
cells O
present O
in O
this O
infiltrate O
. O

An O
immunohistochemical O
staining O
panel O
was O
done O
to O
determine O
the O
nature O
of O
this O
inflammatory B-ety
infiltrate I-ety
by O
using O
antibodies O
S O
- O
100 O
, O
CD1a O
, O
CD O
- O

and O
CD45RO O
that O
were O
positive O
. O

These O
immunohistochemical O
findings O
were O
fundamental O
for O
the O
final O
diagnosis O
of O
LCH B-ety
. O

The O
treatment O
included O
surgical O
extraction O
of O
all O
superior O
teeth O
, O

and O
systemic O
corticoid O
therapies O
. O

After O
8 O
years O
of O
