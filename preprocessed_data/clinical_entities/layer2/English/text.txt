at O

the O
victim O
could O
not O

however O
, O
we O
assume O
that O
the O
snake O
was O
gloydius O

A O

so O
the O

in O
this O

we O
describe O
a O

of O
onychomycosis B-ety
in O
a O
55 O

year-old O
female O
with O
no O

of O
her O
left O

suggestive O
of O
proximal O

onychomycosis B-ety
. O

it O
was O
also O
accompanied O
by O
paronychia B-ety

the O
nail O
also O
showed O

nail O
margins O
were O
fragile O

although O
the O

revealed O
that O
she O

the O
patient O
was O
non-diabetic O

of O
the O

was O
done O
by O
using O
40% O
potassium O

( O
KOH O
) O
which O
revealed O
the O
presence O
of O
septate O

was O
grown O
on O

at O
25 O

. O

the O
fungal O
growth O
was O
seen O
in O
SDA O

chloramphenicol O
. O

initially O
the O

was O
whitish O

biseriate O
phialides O
which O
covered O
the O

was O
repeated O
thrice O
at O
an O

. O

all O
the O

here O
a O

an O
8 O

histories I-ety
, O
her O

she O
was O
born O
at O
a O
local O
birthing O

, O
at O
full O

with O
no O
antenatal O
or O
perinatal O
complications O
, O
attended O
solely O
by O

, O
she O
was O
exclusively O
breast-fed O
, O

was O
started O
at O
6 O

, O
her O
weight O
, O
length O
and O
psychomotor O
development O
were O
within O
the O

, O
the O

was O
described O
as O
a O
good O

on O
a O
normal O

, O
and O
was O
thriving O
appropriately O
. O

furthermore O
, O
the O

presented O
recurrent O
episodes O
of O
respiratory B-ety
tract I-ety
infections I-ety
such O
as O
pneumonia B-ety
and O
sinusitis B-ety
since O
2 O
years O
of O
age O
, O
indeed O
there O
was O
history O
of O
5 O

at O
a O
health O
centre O
; O
the O
last O
one O
goes O
back O
to O
the O

of O
6 O
, O
then O
she O
was O
sent O
back O
to O
our O
department O
for O
a O
complete O
management O
. O

on O
admission O
, O
our O
patient O
had O
characteristic O
facial O
appearance O
with O
a O
combination O
of O
receding B-ety
forehead I-ety
, O
receding O
mandible O
and O
prominent B-ety

, O
she O
had O
also O
epicanthal B-ety
folds I-ety
, O
large B-ety
ears I-ety
, O
and O
sparse O
. O

in O
addition O
, O
profound O
microcephaly B-ety
was O
noticed O
( O

3SD O
) O
that O
contrasted O
with O
normal O
developmental O
milestones O
and O
good O
comprehension O
, O
while O
no O
motor O
problems O
and O
no O
delayed B-ety

were O
observed O
. O

on O
the O

, O
mild O

was O
observed O
( O
- O
2SD O
on O
the O
weight O
and O

) O
with O
periorbital O
squamous O

. O

on O
the O
basis O
of O
this O
clinical O
presentation O
, O
a O
tentative O
diagnosis O
of O
nijmegen B-ety
breakage I-ety
syndrome I-ety
had O
been O
made O
; O
it O
was O
confirmed O
later O
by O
genetic O
analysis O
. O

because O
of O
recurrent O
episodes O
of O
respiratory B-ety

infections I-ety
and O
susceptibility O
to O
develop O
an O
immune B-ety
deficiency I-ety
further O
laboratory O

was O
notable O

after O
the O
examination O

it O
was O
revealed O
that O
in O

of O
the O

it O
was O
also O
noticed O
that O
there O
was O
a O

since O
the O

the O

the O

the O
manufacturing O

that O
made O
it O

so O
, O
the O

was O
done O
on O
the O

the O
impressions O
were O
taking O
with O

was O
in O

two O
layers O

were O
wrapped O
on O
the O
fingers O
for O
about O
10 O
minutes O

were O
taken O
off O

then O
the O
liquid O

was O
poured O
into O
the O

then O
another O

to O
create O
the O

the O

although O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O

bleeding B-ety
in O
the O
levin O

we O
thus O
performed O
an O

an O

, O
and O
the O
physical O

were O
almost O

we O
performed O
a O
treatment O
by O

chest O
computed O

revealed O
right O
massive O
pleural B-ety

demonstrated O
collapse O

semi-rigid O

were O
successfully O
performed O
under O

a O
single O

, O
because O
surgical O

have O
been O
intolerable O
for O
the O

due O
to O
the O

we O
performed O
