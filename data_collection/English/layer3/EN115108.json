  "text": "We present a case of 32 years old male of Han ethnicity with mucosal melanoma of upper lip, comparing his clinical presentation and histological findings at his first visit and following the recurrence. The patient complained of black discoloration on the left side of upper lip since 4 years which gradually increased in size and later involved the skin of the lip. Excision with 5 mm safety margin was performed but the patient presented with the similar lesion after three and half years of the treatment. So, again wide excision with 2 cm safety margin was performed followed by reconstruction of the lip."
