  "text": "Two siblings, aged 18 years and 15 years, from a consanguineous family presented with pyramidal signs and symptoms since infancy and developmental delay. Whole exome sequencing of the proband identified two compound heterozygous variants (NM_018122.4:c.1762C > G and c.563G > A) in DARS2. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the mutations and their segregation in trans in both patients and in their elder sister (aged 20 years), who showed only brisk reflexes and mild lower limb spasticity. Surprisingly, in contrast to her subtle clinical presentation, the elder sister had abnormal MRI features and serum lactate levels comparable to her ill sisters."
