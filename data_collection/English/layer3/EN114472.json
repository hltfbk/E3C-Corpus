  "text": "A 46-year-old Japanese man developed IgA nephropathy 29Â years ago, following tonsillectomy. As a result, a normal urinalysis was obtained. The patient previously suffered Crohn's disease followed by urinary occult blood and proteinuria six years ago. Exacerbation of IgA nephropathy was highly suspected. Therefore a renal biopsy was performed. A diagnosis of exacerbation of IgA nephropathy with mesangial cell proliferation and fibrotic cellular crescent was based upon the pathological findings. The patient exhibited a positive clinical course and eventually achieved a remission with immunosuppressive therapy including prednisolone treatment. Immunostaining for the detection of IgA subtypes was performed on both of his kidney and excised ileum. The results revealed IgA1 and IgA2 deposition by submucosal cells in intestine. Furthermore, IgA1 deposition of mesangial areas in the patient's kidney, indicated an association of IgA1 with the exacerbation of IgA nephropathy."
