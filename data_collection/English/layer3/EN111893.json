  "text": "We report the case of a 50-year-old male patient who was admitted for sepsis due to gangrenous necrosis of the spleen associated with bacteremia. Causative pathogens were Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus gallolyticus. The patient was successfully treated by splenectomy and targeted intravenous antibiotics. No underlying or predisposing disease was found."
