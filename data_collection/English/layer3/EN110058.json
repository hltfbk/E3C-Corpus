  "text": "A 10-year-old boy was admitted to the Department of Paediatric Surgery of hospital university Hassan II with crampy abdominal pain which had lasted for a 5days. He also had nausea and vomiting in the 2 previous days associated with fever. The physical examination only showed tenderness and muscle guarding in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. His Weight was at the 25 th percentiles. The patient did not look ill as expected, although the duration of symptoms was relatively lengthy. Routine laboratory tests, including full blood count, and plain abdominal radiography, yielded normal results. After initial resuscitation, the patient underwent surgical exploration through a transverse incision in the right lower abdominal quadrant, with the initial diagnosis of appendicitis, 10 ml of clear serosangineous fluid was aspirated from the peritoneal cavity. A thick, firm, knobby mass was then encountered in the right lower abdominal cavity. This mass was found to be an edematous omentum. The omentum was twisted 720 clockwise, without any point of distal fixation. The omentum was untwisted. Through exploration of the cavity found a normal appendix without any additional findings. No growth of microorganisms was encountered from the peritoneal culture. There were no complications after the operation, and the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day."
