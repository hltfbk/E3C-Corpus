  "text": "We report on a newborn term infant that presented on the second day of life with signs of encephalopathy, followed by hypovolemia and respiratory distress caused by a severe pulmonary haemorrhage. Fluid resuscitation and mechanical ventilation were initiated and the coagulopathy was corrected by the administration of fresh frozen plasma. Echocardiography revealed a normal cardiac function. After 6Â days of full intensive care, the patient survived without sequellae. The clinical presentation in absence of signs of infection raised a strong suspicion for a metabolic disorder and genetic testing revealed MCADD due to a homozygous A985G mutation."
