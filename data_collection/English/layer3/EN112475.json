  "text": "A 70-year-old Japanese woman who had undergone resection for a thymic cyst 10 years earlier was found to have a solid nodule with a multilocular lesion at the site of the previous operation. We suspected that the tumor was a malignant tumor and performed trans-sternal radical thymectomy and diagnosed the lesion as micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma pathologically. When we reassessed the thymic cyst that had been resected 10 years earlier, a few lesions of micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma were found in the cyst wall. Based on these findings, we concluded that only the cystic component of micronodular thymoma with lymphoid stroma had been removed, and that the residual lesion grew locally over the next 10 years before being completely resected by reoperation."
