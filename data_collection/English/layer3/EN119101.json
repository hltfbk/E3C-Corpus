  "text": "We describe a case of a 57-year-old woman who developed significant neurological symptoms following percutaneous coronary intervention. An early 'unenhanced' computed tomography scan of the brain was reported as a possible 'subdural haematoma'. The symptoms reversed within hours and the computed tomography scan was normal 24 hours later. The diagnosis and its possible mechanism are discussed."
