  "text": "The patient was an 82-year-old woman who complained of right lower abdominal pain for a period of 2 months with no previous history of abnormal hemostasis. She received colonoscopy and was diagnosed with ascending colon cancer. Preoperative blood tests resulted in prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). After further investigation, factor XI (FXI) activity was found to be abnormal at 3.0% and congenital FXI deficiency was diagnosed. By replenishing FXI by FFP, APTT was improved to 37 s so perioperative abnormal bleeding could be avoided and an operation for ascending colon cancer performed. The patient received laparoscopic ileocolic resection and was discharged on a postoperative day 7 uneventfully."
