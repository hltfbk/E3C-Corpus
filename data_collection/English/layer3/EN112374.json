  "text": "59-year-old man with 3 months history of intermittent melena, accompanied by the episodes of abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant and generalized fatigue was admitted to our department. The investigations showed that the patient had a low hemoglobin level, i.e. 10.9 g/dL with hypochromic microcytic anemia pattern seen in complete blood count (MCV 70.2 fl, MCH 21.4 pg). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any abnormalities. Magnetic resonance enterography revealed a large (2.5 × 2.3 cm) pedunculated polyp in the ileum. Examination by single-balloon enteroscopy revealed a polyp with long pedicle located approximately 1.5 m distal to terminal ileum. Polypectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination stated, that the specimen contained ectopic pancreatic tissue which was involving muscular layer of the ileum. Ectopic pancreatic tissue included acinar cells and cystically dilated secretory ducts without islets of Langerhans."
