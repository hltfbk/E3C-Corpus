  "text": "A 10-year-old boy had a history of bilateral tympanostomy tubes insertion one year ago. Both tympanostomy tubes were seen in place in the eardrum during the first two post-operative visits at two months and six months after the operation. The child later developed left hearing loss and ear fullness sensation. During his 12 th month visit, both tympanostomy tubes were noted to be missing. The microscopic examination of the ear was carried out and a blue shadow of the grommet was seen through the left eardrum. The right tympanic membrane was noted to be intact, and it was presumed that the right tube had extruded. Audiometric evaluation done at that time demonstrated mild conductive deafness in the left ear. The right ear had a normal hearing. The computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone showed a foreign body in the left middle ear space attesting to the presence of the tympanostomy tube. Surgical exploration under general anesthesia via the external auditory canal making an incision in the anteroinferior quadrant allowed extraction of the tympanostomy tube."
