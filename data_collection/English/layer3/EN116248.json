  "text": "Two patients with chronic hepatitis B were referred to our hospital due to a hepatic mass. Patient 1 had a 6.4 cm multinodular hepatic mass in the left lobe and a small nodule in the right lobe. Patient 2 had a 4.3 cm hypervascular mass in the right lobe and a 1.1 cm nodule in the left lobe. The pre-operative diagnosis of both cases was hepatocellular carcinoma with metastatic nodule, however, surgical resection pathology revealed that hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma existed independently in the other side of the liver in both cases. Additionally, the background liver histology of both cases was hepatitis B-related chronic hepatitis without cirrhotic change."
