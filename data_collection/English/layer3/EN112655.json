  "text": "A 72-year-old man with dysphagia underwent gastroscopy examination which indicated a large submucous eminence lesion, about 18-24â€‰cm from the incisors. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed the lesion was hypoechoic and originated from the muscularis propria with a clear boundary. The patient refused invasive surgical resection. Then, an en bloc endoscopic full-thickness resection was performed, which perforation was successfully closed with purse-string sutures using a novel endoloop device through standard single-channel endoscopy. Histopathologic examination showed an esophageal leiomyoma."
