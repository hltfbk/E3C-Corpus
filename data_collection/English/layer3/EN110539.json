  "text": "A 5-year-old girl living in a rural area was brought for consultation at the center for screening and treatment of leprosy and Buruli ulcer of Pobè, for ulcers of the buttocks that evolved for 8 months. The lesions began 4 years earlier with a painless but itchy nodule of the right buttock, which gradually spread to the pelvic limbs, back and abdomen evolving towards an indurated plaque. This plaque has secondarily ulcerated. The lesions were treated unsuccessfully with unspecified antibiotics and herbal medicine. Vaccination was up to date for the girl's age and she was not frequenting the river. There was no similar case in her family and entourage. On examination, the patient had a poor general condition, a functional impotence when walking. The palpebral mucous membranes were pale and the bulbar mucous membranes anicterical. There was an infectious syndrome with a fever at 40ºC and a steady tachycardia at 100 beats/minute. Her weight was 12 kg for a height of 1 meter (body mass index at 12). The dermatological examination found a large, indurated, erythematous, warm plaques, that was mobile with respect to the deep plane, adhering to the superficial plane. The edges were clearly delineatable by the fingers, interestingly the lower limbs, the back, and the abdomen. The pubis and the vulva were also indurated. On this large plaque, there were hollow ulcers of variable size (n = 3), with polycyclic contours and fibrinous, necrotic bottom and detached edges. The peri-ulcer area wasn't pigmented. The back of the left foot was the site of lymphoedema. There was no damage to the mucous membranes and integuments. The left knee was blocked in flexion causing a functional impotence to walk. Bilateral and inflammatory inguinal lymphadenopathy were noted. The examination of the other organs was normal: no hepatomegaly, no splenomegaly; the pulmonary fields were free. From this symptomatology we evoked diagnostic hypotheses of Buruli ulcer category 3 in the first time. Ziehl Nielsen staining and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium ulcerans by gene amplification of a specific genome sequence, IS2404 was negative. Direct examination of a punch biopsy sample shows yeasts and mycelial filaments. Complementary examinations included: hypochromic microcytic anemia, leukocytosis at 19.5 10 9 /L with a predominance of eosinophils at 11% or 2.15 10 9 /L (215/ mm 3). The C-reactive protein was positive at 192mg/L. Serologies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B infection were negative. In histopathology, the epidermis is well differentiated and discreetly orthokeratotic. The dermis is the site of significant inflammatory fibrosis. Inflammation is polymorphic with numerous eosinophilic polynuclear cells associated with epithelioid granulomas and giganto-cellular granulomas. The granulomas are centered by extracellular eosinophilic masses and bulky mycelial filaments (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon), which led to basidiobolomycosis. From these results, the diagnosis of ulcerated disseminated basidiobolomycosis in an immunocompetent girl was retained. The mycological culture and polymerase chain reaction to identify the germ weren't done because of technical reasons. The patient was put on ketoconazole (100 mg per day) combined with a correction of anemia using oral iron suspension of 5 mg per day and her nutrititional status by enriched porridges and a high protein diet. Transaminase assay was done at the start of the treatment and then every two weeks for monitoring. Surgical management was carried out, consisting initially of a detachment of ulcers, then secondarily a cutaneous mesh transplant to promote the healing of large ulcers. The correction of the flexum, the recovery of the extremities of limbs and walking, as well as the management of lymphoedema were carried out by the physiotherapists. Progression was favorable after 14 weeks of complete medical treatment, lymphoedema, flexum correction, and ulcer healing. There was no recidivism after 6 months and then one year of follow-up."
