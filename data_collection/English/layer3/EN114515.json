  "text": "Ophthalmoscopy in a 36-year-old man revealed a localized defect of the retinal nerve fiber layer associated with a yellowish-gray lesion at the inferior temporal outer margin of a peripapillary gamma zone. Enhanced depth imaging of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a dehiscence at the connecting point between the central end of Bruch's membrane and the peripheral end of the border tissue of Elschnig and Jacoby. Retinal nerve fiber layer tissue was herniated through this defect into a cavitation located in the suprachoroidal space and the space above the cerebrospinal fluid space. At a 2-year follow-up examination, the defect and retinal nerve fiber layer defect appeared unchanged."
