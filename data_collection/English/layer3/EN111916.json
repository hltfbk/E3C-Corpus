  "text": "We report a case of 51-years-old woman, with a religious garment, with slowly progressing weakness of the proximal limb muscles, extreme fatigue, chest and lower spine pain, paresthesia, depression, difficulties in walking and waddling gait. On whole-body bone scintigraphy diffuse metabolic changes were present, and in DXA osteoporosis was shown due to severe vitamin D deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Treatment with high doses of vitamin D and calcium replacement improved clinical manifestation of osteomalacia for few months. Absent of waddling gait with no pain was evident due to the better muscle and bone performance after the treatment."
