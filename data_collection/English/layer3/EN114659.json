  "text": "A 45-year-old male patient presented with pain and paresthesias in left lower thigh and leg. He was previously treated as L5 radiculopathy confirmed with lumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). He received analgesics followed by nerve root blocks at another center. He was referred to our center for L4-5 root decompression. Due to atypical spine symptoms, leg radiographs and MRI was done, which showed isolated stress fracture of the left proximal fibula."
