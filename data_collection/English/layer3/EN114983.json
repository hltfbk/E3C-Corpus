  "text": "A 25-year-old Sri Lankan phenotypically female having 46 XY karyotype with a history of primary amenorrhoea, presented with left loin pain associated with fever. General examination revealed a tall stature, scanty axillary and pubic hair, small breasts and clitoromegally. A tender ill-defined mass was detected in the left hypochondrial region. She had high erythrocyte sedimentation rate with elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Her serum hormonal assay revealed a low estradiol level with elevated luteinizing hormone and follicular stimulating hormone levels with normal progesterone and testosterone levels. Computerized tomography of abdomen showed a large complex mass lesion in relation to antero-medial aspect of the lower pole of the left kidney with para-aortic and left common iliac lymph nodes. The diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed the presence of internal female genitalia and the mass lesion was seen in left para-aortic region. The histology revealed a germ cell tumor compatible with a dysgerminoma."
