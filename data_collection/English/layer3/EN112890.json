  "text": "In this case report, a 48-year-old man presented with a large tumor in the right iliac region that turned out to be OFD. The patient had rebound tenderness in his right hip. After radiography examination, magnetic resonance imaging examinations and some physical examination, extensive bone destruction in the right ilium was confirmed. Moreover, changes in bone mineral density and peripheral cortical bone sclerosis with surrounding soft tissue swelling were observed. Thus, this patient was considered to have giant monostotic OFD of the ilium. The tumor-related area was removed completely by surgery, and the remaining cavity was filled by artificial bones from the opposite ilium. According to the results of follow-up, the patient had normal flexion and extension activities of the right hip joint, and there was no evidence of recurrence of the tumor."
