  "text": "A 19-year-old HIV-negative female was found to have multiple lung nodules by the chest X-ray during the physical examination. Her chest CT scan revealed multiple round-like pulmonary nodules in both lungs. Based on the morphological features and immunohistochemical examination for vascular markers CD31, CD34 and D2-40, the mass was diagnosed as SCH after surgery."
