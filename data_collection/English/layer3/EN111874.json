  "text": "We report a case of a young male patient with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who presented to hospital with symptoms of meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultured a Salmonella Enteritidis strain. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of the isolate, revealed the strain to be colistin resistant. Despite early and aggressive antimicrobial therapy, the patient succumbed to the illness after a short stay in hospital. Subsequent genomic analysis of the isolate showed no presence of the mcr genes or resistance-conferring mutations in phoPQ, pmrAB, pmrHFIJKLME/arnBCADTEF, mgrB, and acrAB genes, suggesting the presence of a novel colistin resistance mechanism."
