  "text": "A 40-year-old male was admitted for 1-week-long unconsciousness. Brain MRI revealed a rim-enhanced mass within the corpus callosum body. Central nervous system demyelinating disease was suspected. Empirical corticosteroid treatment led to some improvement, but his condition deteriorated 2 months later. Brain MRI revealed punctate new foci. Cryptococcus neoformans was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. Cryptococcus antigen test was positive in his current and previous cerebrospinal fluid samples. The patient died despite standard antifungal treatment."
