  "text": "We herein report a case in which conservative treatment was achieved for an 83-year-old male patient with spontaneous pneumoperitoneum that probably occurred due to duodenal diverticulosis. He had stable vital signs and slight epigastric discomfort without any other signs of peritonitis. A chest radiograph and computed tomography showed that a large amount of free gas extended into the upper abdominal cavity. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed duodenal diverticulosis but no perforation of the upper gastrointestinal tract. He was diagnosed with spontaneous pneumoperitoneum, and conservative treatment was selected. His medical course was uneventful, and pneumoperitoneum disappeared after 6Â months."
