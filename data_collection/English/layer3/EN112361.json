  "text": "Two infants with an atypical presentation of JXG, one with multiple blueberry muffin rash-like skin lesions and the other with severe multi-systemic involvement, are reported. Diagnosis was established by skin biopsy including histological work-up and immunostaining, where markers for macrophages (CD68 and CD163) exhibited significant reactivity."
