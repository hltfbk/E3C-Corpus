  "text": "A 56 year-old man was diagnosed with asymptomatic left sided hydronephrosis while being investigated for rheumatoid arthritis. CT scan imaging showed ill defined fascial plains around the kidney and thickening around the renal hilum suggestive of localized inflammatory change. Worsening intermittent left loin pain with increasing hydronephrosis, significant cortical thinning and marked deterioration of renal function necessitated nephrectomy. Macroscopy showed a hydronephrotic fibrotic kidney with microscopy and immunohistochemistry consistent with a histological diagnosis of IMT."
