  "text": "We report the computed tomography (CT) and MRI findings of MESTK in a 19-year-old male adolescent. To our knowledge, this case report is the first report of MRI findings of MESTK in male adolescents. The patient was admitted to Subei People's Hospital (Jiangsu Province, China) in July 2017 after a renal mass on the left side was detected by ultrasound during a clinical examination. Blood tests were all normal. Non-enhanced CT showed a round, well-circumscribed complex mass, approximately 45 mm Ã— 40 mm in size. MRI revealed a clear well-circumscribed mass with a mixed arrangement of solid and cystic components. On T2 weighted images, some hypointensities were found in the solid areas. After contrast enhancement, moderate or mild enhancement was found in the solid component, which increased with time. A radical left nephrectomy was performed. The pathology analysis revealed a mixed epithelial and stromal tumor. The patient had no imaging findings of recurrence or metastasis at 12 months following surgery."
