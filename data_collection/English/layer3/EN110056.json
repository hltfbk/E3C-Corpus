  "text": "A 28 years old woman consulted for a firm mass in the left upper abdomen. The interview found no history of family or personal neoplasms, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), colorectal disease, no concept of hormonal contraception, alcoholism or smoking. The patient was secondparous delivering by cesarean section in her first pregnancy five years earlier, through a Pfannestiel incision and by vaginal delivery in her second pregnancy 16 months ago. The patient noticed a small tumor in the anterior abdominal wall for the first time 6 months post partum. This tumor, initially neglected by the patient, was gradually increasing in size and associated with a sustained pressure in her cesarean scar inciting the woman for consulting 10 months after its discovery. On clinical examination, the general condition was maintained. We found a huge anterior abdominal wall mass measuring 20 cm × 25 cm, firm, painless, fixed to the superficial and deep levels. Blood parameters analyses were within normal range. Ultrasonography showed an oval mass of 21 centimeters with hypo and heterogeneous echogenicity and well defined margins in the left anterolateral abdominal wall. Preoperative computed tomography scan images revealed a well-circumscribed, large mass (23 × 18 × 13 cm) with heterogeneous density. The mass was close to the left rectus abdominal muscle and after intravenous administration of contrast medium it demonstrated no enhancement even in the delayed images. After these both investigations, the mass was thought to be a hematoma. The decision was made for laparotomy, which was performed via a midline incision. A large mass attached firmly to the inner aspect of the abdominal wall was found intraoperatively with no infiltration of abdominal cavity organs. Surgeons took over and the mass was removed by wide excision with a safe margins. The defect was reconstructed with polypropylene mesh. Subsequent histopathology revealed features of a desmoid tumor. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged at the 9th postoperative day. Coloscopy, performed 3 months later, was normal."
