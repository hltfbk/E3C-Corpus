  "text": "A 34-year-old Pakistani male with a prior history of biopsy-proven autoimmune hepatitis presented to a regional hospital with severe fever, cytopenias, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, splenomegaly, and a bone marrow biopsy showing hemophagocytosis. After ruling out mimicking conditions, a diagnosis of HLH was made using the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria. He was treated with dexamethasone and etoposide, without bone marrow transplantation (BMT) due to poor functional status. At one-year after follow-up, he had returned to his baseline functional status without recurrence."
