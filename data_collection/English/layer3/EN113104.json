  "text": "A 41-year-old female received fallopian tube embolization for birth control. After that she noticed \"clear vaginal discharge\". She neglected that symptom for 7Â years, until a sudden onset of abdominal pain brought her to the ER. Retrograde ureterogram confirmed UFF and revealed severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney. She received left nephrectomy afterwards and recovered well, with no urine leakage from her vagina."
