  "text": "A 62-year old woman was seen after the urinary expulsion of a 6.5 mm diameter cancellous screw. About seven years earlier, she had been hit by a motorcyclist while crossing the street. On admission at the time of the initial injury, thoraco-abdominal computerized tomography with intravenous contrast material revealed a bladder injury and pelvic ring fractures. An anterior-posterior type injury to the pelvic ring was diagnosed with symphyseal pubis disruption, and widening of the left sacroiliac joint with an associated sacral fracture. Explorative laparotomy revealed two bladder lacerations of both the posterior and the anterior bladder wall, which were repaired primarily. Orthopedic surgeons reduced the pelvis and stabilized it with two plates and screws. Seven years after the original injury, the patient presented with recurrent abdominal pain after expelling a screw into the toilet while urinating. Planar radiographs showed only five of the original screws remaining in the two symphyseal plates, and all screws appeared to have loosened when compared to the original fixation radiograph."
