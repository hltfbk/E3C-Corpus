  "text": "The patient, a female newborn, was the second infant from a 31 year-old gravida 2 para 2 mother. The maternal past medical history included a previous preterm male stillborn with undiagnosed case of non-immune hydrops fetalis. Family history revealed also two undiagnosed cases of hydrops fetalis in two preterm stillbirths. Third trimester fetal ultrasonography revealed severe hydrops fetalis with skin edema, polyhydramnios, hepatomegaly, clustered bowel loops, and fetal hypokinesia. Maternal prenatal tests showed blood type A, Rh +, negative maternal serum indirect Coombs test, immunity to rubella and negative serology results for toxoplasma, hepatitis surface antigen and cytomegalovirus. The infant was delivred by cesarean section indicated for breech presentation and polyhydramnios, at 36 weeks of gestation. Apgar scores of 2 and 3 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Body weight was 2600gm (39 th percentile), length was 44 cm (10 th percentile), and head circumference was 34 cm (82 th percentile). At birth, she was apneic and required endotracheal intubation. Physical examination revealed a state of hydrops with generalized skin edema, thickened and shiny skin, hepatosplenomegaly, hypertonia, arthrogryposis and akinesia. No Dysmorphic facial features or other congenital anomalies were associated. Chest radiograph showed an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Laboratory results included blood type A, Rh +, negative direct Coombs test, a normal blood cell count. Bacterial and viral cultures are negative, SGOT / SGPT: 237/22U/L. Urinary screening for metabolic disorders was negative. Specific tests was as follows: low glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity on leucocytes (patient level =0.4 nmol/h/mg, controls=20 nmol/h/mg); and high serum chitotriosidase level (patient=16 200 nmol/h/ml, controls 200 nmol/h/ml). Parent's measurement of glucocerebrosidase enzymatic activity on leucocytes showed results consistent with a heterozygous for GD. The infant died on the first day of life after stopping resuscitation. Diagnosis was confirmed by direct sequencing of glucose rebrosidase gene (GBA). A single nucleotide substitution was found in exon 9: c.1255G>A leading to the substitution of Aspartic Acid by Asparagine (p.Asp419Asn). This diagnosis has allowed two prenatal diagnoses for the next pregnancies. The foetuses were unaffected."
