  "text": "A 5-year-old girl presented with increasing abdominal pain around the umbilicus. On laboratory investigation serum pancreatic enzymes and C-reactive protein were elevated. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a normal pancreas but a cystic lesion in the mesentery of the ileum. A nodule with a marked enhancement was observed in the wall of the lesion. During the laparoscopy, the lesion was found at the root of the mesentery and was distant from the ileum. The lesion was resected suspecting an abscess. Pathologically, the wall of the lesion consisted of small bowel like tissue, and pancreatic tissue was seen beneath the mucosa. There were some post inflammatory changes in the pancreatic tissue. Retrospectively on thin slice enhanced CT, an independent blood supply was noted. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of ectopic pancreatitis in an iliac intestinal duplication cyst was made."
