  "text": "The first case was a 53-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to diabetic nephropathy and a history of entero-adhesiolysis. She underwent PD catheter insertion by the SMAP with PWAT. Four months after PD catheter insertion, the catheter was found to perforate sigmoid colon. The second case was a 57-year-old woman with ESRD due to large polycystic kidney disease. She underwent the same procedure. After exteriorization of the catheter, she developed peritonitis due to perforation of the catheter tip into the bowel. Both patients were safely removed the catheter with uneventful recovery."
