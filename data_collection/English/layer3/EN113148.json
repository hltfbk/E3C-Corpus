  "text": "A 31-year-old man with no prior history presented with refractory status epilepticus. His seizure persisted even with multiple anti-epileptic drugs and required prolonged general anesthesia under mechanical ventilation. Magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid did not indicate the cause of seizure, and autoantibodies related to encephalitis were not detected. It was speculated that the patient had occult autoimmune encephalopathy because of its acute-onset clinical course preceded by fever, even without definite evidence of an autoimmune mechanism. The patient received intravenous methylprednisolone, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin in succession and manifested a favorable outcome after these treatments."
