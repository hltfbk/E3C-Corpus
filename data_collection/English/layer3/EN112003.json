  "text": "Herein, we report the case of a 12-year-old boy with developmental delay. He had dysmorphic facial features including wide-spaced eyes, prominent nasal bridge continuing to forehead, abnormal teething and micrognathia. He also had mild clinodactyly of both hands. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a pathogenic mutation in NSD2 [c.4029_4030insAA, p.Glu1344Lysfs*49] isolated from peripheral blood DNA. Sanger confirmation of this variant revealed it as a de novo truncating variant in the family."
