  "text": "A 39 year-old woman presented with severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and emesis for 3 days. In her past medical history she had experienced an episode of aHUS leading to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in 2007 and a genetic workup revealed a heterozygous mutation in the membrane cofactor protein gene. In 2014 she underwent cadaveric kidney transplantation. Four years later she had to go back on hemodialysis due to allograft failure following a severe systemic cytomegalovirus infection resulting in transplant failure. At presentation she still received calcineurin-inhibitor therapy and reported subfebrile temperatures and pain projecting over the transplant prior to the current symptoms. A contrast enhanced CT-scan of the abdomen revealed inflammatory wall thickening of the small intestine. Diagnostic endoscopy discovered fresh blood in the small intestine without a clear source of bleeding. Histopathology of the small intestine biopsies showed severe thrombotic microangiopathy. Of note, the patient persistently had no signs of systemic hemolysis. Since the TMA of the small intestine was most likely due to aHUS, eculizumab treatment was initiated which abolished the symptoms."
