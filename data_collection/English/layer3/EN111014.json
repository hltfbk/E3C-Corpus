  "text": "We present a novel case of a 12-years-old female with recurrent pediatric HSP with a combination of the rare manifestations of bullous rash and pulmonary nodules. She initially presented with the bullous rash, chest pain, cough, and abdominal pain. Patient was successfully treated with intravenous pulse corticosteroids followed by a high dose oral corticosteroid taper, with resolution of the bullous rash and pulmonary nodules."
