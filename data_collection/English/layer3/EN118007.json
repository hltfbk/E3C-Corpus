  "text": "We report the case of a 57-year-old man who presented with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction secondary to a 100% occlusion at the ostium of first diagonal (D1) branch. Patient also had a 70% stenosis of the mid-segment of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery at the D1 branching point (1,1,1 Medina classification). A bare metal stent (BMS) was deployed at the site of the culprit lesion in the D1, while a drug eluting stent (DES) was placed in the LAD. We believe that the BMS at the culprit thrombotic, inflamed site in D1 is more likely to re endothelialize than a DES and the DES in the LAD, is less likely to re-stenose than a BMS."
