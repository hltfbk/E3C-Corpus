  "text": "We report the case of a 50-year-old man operated on for a fat tumor of the thigh initially diagnosed as lipoma but revealing to be a myxoid liposarcoma after histopathological examination. The initial incomplete tumor excision required the need for a re-excision with adjuvant chemotherapy and complementary radiotherapy."
