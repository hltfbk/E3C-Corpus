  "text": "The patient is a 71-year-old man who underwent distal pancreatectomy for PDAC. Seventeen months after the surgery, a 30-mm nodule was detected at the lesser curvature of the stomach, which was diagnosed as recurrence of PDAC in the lymph nodes. He then received gemcitabine and S-1 combination chemotherapy for 6 months. Because tumor size remained approximately the same and tumor marker levels decreased, total gastrectomy and cholecystectomy were performed. Pathological examination showed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the subserosa and muscularis propria of the stomach and gallbladder. The patient remains alive at 41 months after the second surgery with liver metastasis."
