  "text": "A 28 year old female presented to the emergency department of our hospital, with complaints of early satiety, intermittent episodes of bilious vomiting, a slow growing, painless abdominal mass and an inability to pass motion and flatus since 2 weeks. On examination, a lobulated firm mass extending from the epigastrium to the pubic bones and bilateral lumbar region was found, becoming prominent on straight leg raising test. She also reported a history of appendicectomy and two pregnancies with spontaneous deliveries in 1994 and 1999. Analysed blood parameters were within normal limits. A standing abdominal film showed a soft tissue mass over the whole abdomen. A preoperative CT scan revealed a left lower abdominal wall tumor of unknown dignity. The patient was taken up for an emergency laparotomy and intraoperatively, resection of the tumor with excision of the internal oblique abdominal muscle followed, and the defect was subsequently covered with a mesh and strengthened with omentum. Intraoperatively, the anterior rectus sheath was found tightly adherent to the mass. The tumor was also adherent to the parietal peritoneum and bladder on its posterior surface with strong adhesions to the pubic bones inferiorly as well as to the external iliac vein on the right side, which necessitated a vascular repair with prolene 6-0, round bodied, continuous sutures, after excision of the tumor. The tumor was found to cause compression of the intestines & the stomach leading to vomiting & early satiety. The excised tumor weighed 4.6 kg. Subsequent histopathology confirmed the features of a desmoid tumor."
