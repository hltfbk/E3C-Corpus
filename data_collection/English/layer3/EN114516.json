  "text": "A 72-year-old man with already diagnosed and treated metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of the terminal ileum (G1 rated, Ki-67 index 1 %) was again suffering from increasing diarrhea, abdominal cramps and weight lost. These symptoms were similar to the initial symptoms due to the tumor which improved at the time after total resection of the primary in the terminal ileum and regular therapy with long-acting release depot octreotide intramuscularly. As progression/tachyphylaxis in symptomatic patients with carcinoid syndrome undergoing therapy, reassessment of disease and analysis of tumor markers was initiated, and the interval of intramuscular injections was shortened. Radiological findings and tumor marker levels disclosed no evidence of neuroendocrine tumor progression and the symptoms continued. After 4 weeks with symptoms the patient developed additionally fever. Due to impaired renal function and elevated signs of systemic inflammation fluid replacement and empiric antimicrobial therapy were started. At this time-point the first stool cultures were taken which disclosed an infection with C. coli. The empiric antimicrobial therapy was stopped after five days because of multidrug-resistant isolated strain. During the ongoing symptomatic therapy the patient becomes gradually symptom-free 6 weeks later, resulting a total duration of symptoms caused by campylobacteriosis of 13 weeks."
