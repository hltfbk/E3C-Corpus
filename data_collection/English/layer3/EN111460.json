  "text": "A 15-year-old Japanese boy was injured by contact with another player while playing soccer. He was immediately admitted to the authors' hospital with knee pain. Radiography and computed tomography revealed an avulsion fracture of the medial collateral ligament at the femoral attachment and an avulsion fracture of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle. In examination under anesthesia, the Lachman test was negative and posterior drawer test was positive. Fixation of the avulsion fractures of the medial collateral ligament and medial head of the gastrocnemius was performed 9 days after the injury. After fixation, valgus instability at full extension had disappeared. The knee was immobilized in a brace for 2 weeks postoperatively. One year postoperatively, the posterior drawer test was slightly positive; however, our patient was able to ambulate without pain and returned to sports without feeling instability in his knee."
