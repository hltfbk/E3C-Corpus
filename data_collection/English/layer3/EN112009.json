  "text": "Our case is 9-year-old Indian (Indo-Aryan) boy identified incidentally with clinical features suggestive of choroidal osteoma with marked diminution of vision. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography demonstrated high reflectivity from the choroid and atrophy of the overlying retinal layers and B-scan ultrasound demonstrated multiple highly reflective calcified lesions within the choroid."
