  "text": "We present a case report of a patient suffering an acetabular fracture 6 years after a HA. A one stage surgical procedure was the treatment of choice, consisting of a stabilization the acetabulum fracture by means of cerclage wires and a conversion of the HA to a total hip arthroplasty (THA). 4 months after surgery, she regained her pre-operative functional status, and a radiographic evaluation of the right hemipelvis showed good signs ofthe fracture healing without migration ofthe acetabular component."
