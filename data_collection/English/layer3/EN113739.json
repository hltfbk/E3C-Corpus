  "text": "We report an unusual case of multiple abscesses in a 32-year-old white British woman presenting to our Emergency department in the UK after returning from a holiday in The Gambia, West Africa. She did not complain of systemic symptoms and was otherwise fit and healthy with no significant past medical history. During examination, two maggots were expressed from the abscesses by applying lateral pressure to each lesion. The larvae were found to be Cordylobia anthropophaga. She was discharged with antibiotics to prevent secondary infection with no further follow-up."
