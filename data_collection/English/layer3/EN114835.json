  "text": "A 56-year-old man of Wapishana ethnicity presented with complaints of referred penile discomfort and pain during sexual intercourse for 5 years. A physical examination revealed a mobile, compressible subcutaneous non-tender mass of 4 cm diameter located on the left-side of his penile foreskin. There were no signs of inflammation, no grip on the penile shaft, and no urethral discharge or enlargement of lymph nodes. We found no evidence of other cysts on cutaneous examination. We performed classical excision of the lesion under local anesthesia and confirmed the diagnosis of steatocystoma with the pathological report. As there were no complications, we discharged him the same day."
