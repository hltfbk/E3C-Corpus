  "text": "A previously well 50 year old Sinhalese farmer in Sri Lanka was admitted to a tertiary care hospital with five day history of fever, headache, prostration, severe myalgia especially in the calves and yellowish discoloration of the eyes. He was febrile, icteric and had suffusion of both conjunctivae. His pulse rate and blood pressure was 98/min and 90/50 mmHg respectively. The initial laboratory examinations showed neutrophil leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia. Antibodies test for leptospirosis was done and IgM was positive. Because of this evidence the probable diagnosis of leptospirosis was made and antibiotic therapy initialed with intravenous cefotaxime 1 g 8 hourly and crystalline penicillin 2 mu 6 hourly. On the eighth day he developed chest pain associated with shortness of breath with a heart rate of 120/min. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evidence suggested myocarditis, and troponin I titer was positive. Supportive care was provided and antibiotics were continued. On the 13(th) day of illness he developed lower motor type facial nerve palsy of the left side with positive Bell's phenomenon. But rest of the neurological examination was normal. He was discharged on a step-down course of prednisolone and physiotherapy. He fully recovered from cardiac involvement before discharge but recovery from facial nerve palsy took place only six months later."
