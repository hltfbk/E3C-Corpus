  "text": "A 73-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus was admitted to our hospital with a 5-month history of severe low back pain. A radiograph of the lumbar spine demonstrated intervertebral disc space narrowing with indistinct end plates at the L3-L4 level. T2-weighted magnetic resonance image showed high signal intensity at L3-L4 intervertebral disc space. We suspected pyogenic spondylitis and performed percutaneous posterolateral endoscopic debridement. The results of intraoperative sample cultures were positive for P. micros, an anaerobic Gram-positive coccus. He was treated by the antibiotic therapy. Low back pain resolved and his white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels remained normal with the combination therapy. During 2-year follow-up, he reported no low back pain and had no signs of infection recurrence."
