  "text": "We report the case of a 43-year-old Moroccan woman, without history of skin or breast cancer, nor any skin, oro-pharynx, or anal lesions. Her family history was not significant for breast cancer.\nShe was admitted to our center eight months ago for a mass in the left breast which had been growing rapidly. A physical examination revealed a left breast infected mass, measuring 9x8x9 cm in size, with some cystic areas, associated with ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy.\nMammograhy demonstrated an irregular opacity with skin infiltration, approximately 9 cm in its greatest dimension, which was classified as BI-RADS 5. The right breast was negative on palpation and mammography.\nThe mass's surgical biopsy revealed a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast. Immunohistochemical evaluation was negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and HER2.\nMetastatic disease was ruled out via Total body CT scan, and bone scintigraphy. The serum level of tumor marker CA 15-3 was 290 U/ml (≤ 30).\nShe underwent three courses of neoadjuvant therapy: the first course using cisplatin (at a dose of 75 mg/m² as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on day 1) and an infusion of 5-fluoro-Uracil as bolus (at a dose of 400 mg /m² per day for 3 days) every 3 weeks. She presented a grade 3 vomiting and febril neutropenia which was treated by vancomycin with good evolution.\nBecause of the side effects, we substitute, In the two others courses,cisplatin by Carboplatin (at an area under the curve of 5 mg per milliliter per minute, as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on day 1) and we substitute 5-fluorourcil bolus by continuous infusion (at a dose of 2400 mg/m² for 2 days) every 3 weeks.\nThe evaluation investigations based on CT scan showed a contralateral breast progression and apparition of bone metastatsis at D10.\nShe received a palliative chemotherapy based on weekly paclitaxel at a dose of 80 mg/m², stopped after one course because of her general performans status deterioration. She died 7 months after her admission."
