  "text": "Hepatic granuloma was found incidentally in an asymptomatic 5-month-old infant who was found dead in his bed. The probable cause of death was asphyxia due to milk aspiration into the lungs. The granuloma was composed of epithelioid histiocytes with frequent multinucleated Langhans-type giant cells and a small number of lymphocytes."
