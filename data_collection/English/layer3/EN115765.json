  "text": "We report the case of a 64-year-old Caucasian man diagnosed with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia in April 2005. After 4 years of treatment with imatinib, he became intolerant to the drug and was switched to nilotinib. Two years later, he decided to stop nilotinib. Undetectable molecular response persisted for 30 months after discontinuation of the drug."
