  "text": "We present a case of a 65-year-old Ghanaian female. She presented a progressively enlarging mass over the volar aspect of the right wrist and palm. She did not have a previous history of tuberculosis. However, her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was high and Mantoux (purified protein derivative) test was strongly positive (more than 15Â mm). Radiograph of ulna, radius, and wrist showed osteopenic changes around the distal radius. Excision biopsy of the mass was done and samples sent for histopathology comment. The findings were an inflamed, thickened synovia with rice bodies: suggestive of tuberculous tenosynovitis. Anti-tuberculous chemotherapy was commenced on the second postoperative day."
