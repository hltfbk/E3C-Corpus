  "text": "We had a 67 year old hypertensive lady with a mitral stenosis, presenting in ischemic or hypertensive heart failure with underlying valvular disease, without pulmonary hypertension in sinus rhythm. She had pancytopenia with severe anemia and raised liver enzymes. Bone marrow examination showed aplastic anemia. She was treated with ATG and improved subsequently to become transfusion free. However, she succumbed to an unrelated sudden cardiac death."
