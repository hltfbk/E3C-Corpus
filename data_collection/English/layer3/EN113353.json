  "text": "A 73-year-old male complained of a small ulcer on his left toe, which was treated with multiple endovascular therapy. After failed endovascular therapy, he suffered extensive tissue loss with tibial osteomyelitis. We carried out staged surgery that was composed of dual bypass to the sural artery and posterior tibial artery. After intensive debridement and wound care, insertion of a subsequent free gracilis muscle flap to cover the exposed tibial bone was performed, achieving functional limb salvage."
