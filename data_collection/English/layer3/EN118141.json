  "text": "A 39-year-old Caucasian man referred his incapacity to reach and maintain a penile erection during a course of acitretin for the treatment of a severe form of psoriasis. Physical examination, laboratory findings and psychological analysis did not reveal any abnormalities. Two weeks after the withdrawal of acitretin, the patient reported a normalization of his sexual activity."
