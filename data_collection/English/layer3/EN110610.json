  "text": "We describe a large Indian family with multiple males affected with X-linked SEDT. The affected individuals presented with disproportionate short stature, short trunk, and barrel-shaped chest. Elder sibs aged 26 years and 31 years had back and hip pain. Premature osteoarthritis was seen requiring hip replacement surgery in one sib. The known pathogenic nonsense mutation c.209G>A (p.W70X) was identified in TRAPPC2 gene. This is the first mutation proven Indian kindred with X-linked SEDT."
