  "text": "A 62-year-old smoker man, with medical history of long-standing uncontrolled hypertension, presented to the emergency department complaining of sudden onset severe retrosternal chest pain since 3 hours, associated with shortness of breath, nausea and sweating.\nAt time of presentation, physical examination showed blood pressure of 180/110 mmHg in the right arm and 170/100 mmHg in the left arm, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and oxygen saturartion of 92% breathing ambient air. Cardiac examination showed normal heart sounds, an early diastolic murmur and 4/6 in intensity, best heard on left 3 rd intercostal space, with fine crackles in pulmonary auscultation.\nAdmission ECG showed ST-segment elevation in inferior leads suggesting acute inferior myocardial infarction.\nAn urgent bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed akinesia in the left inferior and lateral walls, a dilated aortic root (42 mm) with evidence of intimal tear in the ascending aorta, a significant aortic regurgitation (AR) with normal appearing aortic leaflets and small pericardial effusion. Based on these findings, ascending AD complicated with inferior MI was highly suspected. In that time, anti-hypertensive therapy was started to reduce systolic blood pressure and thrombolytic treatment was not administered.\nEmergent CTA of the chest and abdomen was performed and demonstrated a 4.5 cm diameter ascending aorta with a Stanford type A (Debakey type II) acute dissection arising from the level of annulus aorta and a moderate pericardia effusion. TEE was also performed showing ascending AD beginning from sino-tubular junction with severe AR and the right coronary artery (RCA) was arising from the false lumen of dissection.\nAfter agreement between the cardiologist, the radiologist, the cardiovascular surgeon and the anesthetist, the diagnosis of dissection of the ascending aorta complicated of MI caused by malperfusion of the RCA and pericardial effusion, was confirmed and the decision for immediate surgical repair was made. The patient underwent valve sparing aortic root replacement successfully, with uncomplicated postoperative course. Echocardiographic evaluation 3 months after surgery showed mild valvular AR with LVEF 50%."
