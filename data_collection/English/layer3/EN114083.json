  "text": "The patient was a 53-year-old Black African woman, positive for the HIV, who was operated for implantation of a THA via the Hardinge approach indicated for a severe painful hip with restriction of joint movement and limp. A creamy-white liquid was noticed in the hip joint which was negative for urgent Gram-staining. The surgery was completed with the implantation of a hybrid THA. The post-operative period was uneventful, and she was put on antituberculous drugs following a positive histology result for TB, and to continue her antiretroviral drugs. She still has a satisfactory result for 3 years since her surgery."
