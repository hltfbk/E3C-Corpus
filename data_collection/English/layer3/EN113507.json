  "text": "We describe a case of an 84-year old right-handed man who presented to hospital with dysarthria, dysphagia, right-sided facial drop, a history of generalized weakness and multiple falls. He was admitted to geriatric medicine with the working diagnosis of a posterior circulation stroke syndrome. He was also started on antibiotic treatment for a possible community-acquired pneumonia because of the presence of a low-grade fever and a chest radiograph showing ill-defined left lower lobe airspace disease. Initial lab results were remarkable for an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 112 mm/h and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 110 mg/L consistent with an active inflammatory state. Neurovascular imaging showed mild atherosclerotic changes of the aortic arch and proximal great vessels without significant stenosis. The patient was started on daily high-dose prednisone because of the possibility of a cerebral vasculitis. Bilateral biopsy of temporal arteries showed giant cell arteritis. The patient's neurologic status and inflammatory markers significantly improved (ESR 52 mm/h, CRP 7.0 mg/L) and he was eventually discharged to a seniors home with services."
