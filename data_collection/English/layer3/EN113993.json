  "text": "Here, we describe a case of autoimmune cerebral vasculitis/encephalitis after PD-1 inhibitor treatment for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. Upon PD-1 blockade, the patient developed cerebral lesions, while having disease stabilization of extracranial metastases. Imaging suggested that the patient had new progressing brain metastases. Despite stereotactic irradiation the lesions progressed further. The largest lesion became symptomatic and had to be surgically resected. On examination, cerebral vasculitis was detected but not evidence of metastatic lung cancer. Analysis of the patient's serum revealed the presence of antinuclear antibodies that were already present before starting PD-1 blockade. In addition, we also found anti-vascular endothelial antibodies in the serum."
