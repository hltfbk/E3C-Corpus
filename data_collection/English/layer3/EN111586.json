  "text": "A 53-year-old Sri Lankan male with long-standing diabetes presented with an isolated hand swelling for a 7-month duration. His initial imaging and MRI showed multiple destructive lesions in the carpal bones, surrounding focal fluid collections and found to have caseous material intraoperatively. His histology and microbiological studies were positive for TB with no other concurrent evidence of TB elsewhere."
