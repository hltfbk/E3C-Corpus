  "text": "We present the case of a 54 year old female Caucasian patient with osseous metastases originating from a malignant melanoma of her right conjunctiva. Metastatic deposits were identified in the left humeral diaphysis and left tibial metaphysis. Clinical, radiological and scintigraphic evaluation necessitated prompt stabilisation of both long bones. Following reamed intramedullary nailing and post-operative radiotherapy she remains asymptomatic six months post-operatively."
