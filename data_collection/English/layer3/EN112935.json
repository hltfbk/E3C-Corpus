  "text": "We report a case of dual primary ADCs, especially NHL followed by KS, in a 70-year-old HIV-infected man who was on antiretroviral therapy and had successful virologic suppression. During HAART, he presented with generalized myalgia and abdominal pain. Multiple liver masses were detected and a biopsy revealed Burkitt's lymphoma. After three cycles of anticancer chemotherapy with a favorable response, he was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus retinitis and the anti-cancer chemotherapy was discontinued. Despite successful virologic suppression with HAART, human herpes virus-8 associated Kaposi's sarcoma was diagnosed in his right thigh. He underwent radiation therapy."
