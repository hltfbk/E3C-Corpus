  "text": "A 31-year old male patient was admitted to our emergency department few hours after complaints of nausea and vomiting. Abdominal examination revealed distension and clanging intestinal sounds. Computed tomography showed intestinal obstruction without an obvious cause. The patient underwent diagnostic laparotomy. In this process, approximately 10 cm of invaginated mid-jejunal segment was seen. The pathologic segment was resected and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. The patient was discharged without any complication."
