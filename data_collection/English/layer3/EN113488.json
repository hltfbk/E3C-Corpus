  "text": "Five years after a right lenticular-capsular thalamic stroke, despite a good recovery of voluntary movement that guaranteed independence in daily life activities, a 50-year-old woman presented with mild weakness and spasticity, an important sensory loss and a burning pain in the left upper limb. MT for reducing arm pain was administered in 45-min sessions, five days a week, for two consecutive weeks. MT consisted in performing symmetrical movements of both forearms and hands while watching the image of the sound limb reflected by a parasagittal mirror superimposed to the affected limb. Pain severity was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) before and after the intervention and at one-year follow-up. After the two weeks of MT, the patient demonstrated 4.5 points reduction in VAS pain score of the hand at rest and 3.9 points during a maximal squeeze left hand contraction. At one-year follow-up, pain reduction was maintained and also extended to the shoulder."
