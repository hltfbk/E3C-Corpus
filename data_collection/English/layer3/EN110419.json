  "text": "A case of 34-year-old Moroccan woman who came from a rural area, G4P3 (3 alive children), presented to our emergency department at 37 weeks' gestation with a 3-day history of progressively worsening abdominal pain. The principal complaint on arrival was shortness of breath with associated progressive abdominal distension. She had no particular medical and surgical history. She was seen by a health professional only once during the current pregnancy at the regional hospital. Her last menstrual period was unknown but she reported 9 months of amenorrhea. On examination, she looked generally stable. She was not pale; vital signs were within normal parameters. On abdominal examination her symphysis fundal height was term sized, with longitudinal lie and breech presentation. The fetal heart rate was 139 beats per minute and there were no uterine contractions. On vaginal examination the cervix was closed and uneffaced. There was no vaginal bleeding. On ultrasonography examination, there was a singleton live pregnancy with a low quantity of amniotic fluid. The uterus was empty and the placenta appeared to be attached to the fundus. The gestational age was 37 weeks by ultrasound estimation. An emergency laparotomy was performed with the impression of abdominal pregnancy. A live female neonate was delivered weighing 2800g and the Apgar score was 6 and 8 in 1 and 5 min, respectively. No anomaly was seen on the baby. The fetus was seen in an intact amniotic sac and there was no hemoperitoneum. The placenta was strongly adhered to the fundus and the left adnexa. The uterus and the right adnexa were normal but the left fallopian tube was not identified. The amniotic sac was attached to segments of large bowel and this was removed intraoperatively with no damage. A total hysterectomy with a left adnexectomy was performed and haemostasis was secured. Total estimated intraoperative blood loss was 1500ml. She was transfused with 4 units of packed red blood cells intra-and postoperative period. Both the mother and the baby progressed well, and were kept in the hospital for one week postoperatively, during which the mother recovered well from surgery, with no signs of infection or bleeding. They were discharged home, with a follow-up appointment in one month. The mother and child have been on regular follow up. All investigations by the neonatologist and the paediatrician did not show any abnormality on the baby. The histopathology report show an intra-abdominal pregnancy and the site of rupture was occurred at the interstitial portion of the fallopian tube. The placenta was at term and invading the totality of the left adnexa."
