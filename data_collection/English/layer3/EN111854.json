  "text": "A 52-year-old man presented with features suggesting nephrotic syndrome. Extensive workups were done, and there were elevated serum levels of interleukin-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), capillary pseudothrombus accumulation associated with minimal change nephrotic syndrome, CKD, and WM. Treatment was directed at the patient's WM with bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone whereby serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) decreased. The damage of IgM on the kidney was corrected; thus, the patient's proteinuria and serum creatinine had improved. The patient is still under clinical follow-up."
