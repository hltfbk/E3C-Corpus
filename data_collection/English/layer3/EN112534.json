  "text": "We present the case of a 51-year-old woman diagnosed with a right retroperitoneal mass by computed tomography (CT). The differential diagnosis was between a neurogenic tumour and a mesodermic tumour. The tumour was dissected from the vena cava and right ureter by laparoscopy without performing resection en bloc. Histologic examination of the surgical specimen showed a high-grade leiomyosarcoma of the right gonadal vein. The postoperative course was uneventful. Three cycles of chemotherapy with epirubicin-ifosfamide were performed."
