  "text": "Here we present a CNs type II patient that is not responsive to phenobarbital treatment, which can be explained by two heterozygous mutations in the UGT1A1 gene. A 3 nucleotide insertion in the HNF-1Î± binding site in the proximal promoter previously reported in a Crigler-Najjar patient on one allele and a novel two nucleotide deletion in exon 1, resulting in a frameshift and a premature stop codon."
