  "text": "A 3-years old male was admitted to his local hospital with history of vomiting associated with periods of constipation (for few days) followed by passage of formed stools or loose motions, those never contained blood. There was also colicky abdominal pain that referred to his penis with visible central bowel movements and abdominal distension that worsened with meals. He lost much of his weight although he was a healthy child before. He was exclusively breast fed only for the first six weeks of his life after which he depended mainly on boiled camel milk. Physical examination showed severely wasted boy with WHO z-scoring of his weight for length equal to-4SD, his length and head circumference on the 25 th centile for his age and sex. Abdominal examination revealed distended abdomen with visible peristalsis. Digital rectal examination revealed soft tissue mass 5 cm from the anal margin. He showed no response to nutritional supplementation.\nComplete blood count showed mild norm chromic anemia. Blood urea, serum keratinize and electrolytes were within the normal range. Abdominal and pelvic Ultra sound scan showed picture of intussusception with mesenteric lymph nodes enlargement. Computed tomography scan of his abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast showed large mass in the right iliac fossa indicating intussusception. Stool analysis showed hookworm infestation. He was screened for HIV, tuberculosis and celiac disease and all were excluded.\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics was started for suspected sepsis on admission. The patient was initially managed conservatively, given oral and injectable analgesics and nutritional supplementations with no or little response. Then referred to pediatric surgery after the confirmation of diagnosis and underwent laparotomy, eight cm of his terminal ileum, appendix and right hemi colon up to proximal part of his transverse colon was found to be gangrenous and was resected with end to end anastomosis. Histopathology of resected part showed infiltration of small bowel wall with starry sky patterned cells reaching serosal margins going with Burkitt's lymphoma.\nThe boy did well post operatively, gain three-kilogram weight in the next four weeks. He was referred to the Radioisotopes center and subjected to further investigations for staging. Chemotherapy started with poor compliant was observed."
