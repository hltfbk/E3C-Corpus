  "text": "A 21-year-old Caucasian woman with cystic fibrosis and a totally implantable venous access device presented with severe hypoxaemia. This was initially treated with antibiotics but her oxygen levels did not improve significantly. Subsequently, a transient ischaemic attack occurred. Further investigations, including a contrast echocardiogram and a cardiac magnetic resonance scan, revealed the presence of a large right atrial thrombus and right-to-left intracardiac shunt through a patent foramen ovale."
