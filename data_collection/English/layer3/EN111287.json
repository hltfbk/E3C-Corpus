  "text": "An 11-year-old girl was referred to our outpatient department with a full-thickness injury resulting from a chemical burn having used a topical formic acid solution in the treatment of common warts. On examination, a 20-mm circular full-thickness defect was noted to the dorsum of the hand. The extensor tendons were not involved and there were no signs of infection. She required surgical debridement and local flap coverage. The postoperative recovery was unremarkable."
