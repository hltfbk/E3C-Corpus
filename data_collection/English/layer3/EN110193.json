  "text": "We report the case of a fetus with an isolated omphalocele and whose perinatal outcome was favorable. This is 34 year old woman in labor with no personal or family history. Current pregnancy was followed in our training from 15 weeks of gestation, with discovery of omphalocele prenatally whose diameter was equal 32mm 88 mm at 37 weeks of gestation containing intestines and part of the liver. The assembly is covered by the amniotic membrane, without fetal ascites visualization. No other malformation during the whole pregnancy care (including heart) was detected. The amount of amniotic fluid remained in the standards. A Caesarean was programmed at 39 weeks of gestation. The child was normotrophe, male. The protection of omphalocele in a sterile field was applied immediately and his reinstatement with prosthetic closure was achieved at J1 of life. The karyotype was not asked.\nThe child stayed 72 hours in the neonatology unit without particular metabolic or infectious complications. Currently the infant is 8 months old with good psychomotor development.The surgery to remove plaque is planned soon."
