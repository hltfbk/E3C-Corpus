  "text": "Here we describe two pediatric cases of S. pyogenes endocarditis with associated toxic shock. Case 1 was a previously well Caucasian 6-year-old female who presented with sepsis. Case 2 was an 8-month-old South Asian female who presented with sepsis and pneumonia. We present a review of the literature since the beginning of the antibiotic era of this unusual cause of bacterial endocarditis in children."
