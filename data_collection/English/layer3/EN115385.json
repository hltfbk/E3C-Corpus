  "text": "Here, we report the case of a 63-year-old man with a cT3b urothelial carcinoma which was surgically removed. No neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was administered. After 18 months a lung metastasis was confirmed and resected but no chemotherapy was given after surgery. Twelve months later, the patient relapsed and was treated with a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin and after a decline in renal function the treatment was changed to a combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine which resulted in a partial response which lasted 8 months. Following this vinflunine was administered as a second line treatment. Here we review the evidence available in the literature regarding the suitability of different treatment options for managing muscle-invasive bladder cancer at each step of the case presentation."
