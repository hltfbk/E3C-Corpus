  "text": "A 46-year-old woman who was diagnosed with non-contiguous fractures in cervico-thoracic and thoraco-lumbar junction zones among multiple injuries sustained in a traffic accident was treated with hybrid techniques for posterior instrumentation with an open approach using a computed tomography (CT)-based navigation system and percutaneous pedicle-screwing method. She regained mobility to pre-admission levels and started walking on crutches 3 months postoperatively. Genetic testing for the cause of SED revealed no mutation in the COL2A1 or TRPVR4 genes. The union of fractured spine was confirmed on CT scan 1 year postoperatively."
