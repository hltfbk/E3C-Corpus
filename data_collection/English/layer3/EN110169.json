  "text": "Case 1 A 51-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with pain in the left posterior part of the tongue and a sensation of a foreign object in the throat from the dental clinic where he had been receiving canal treatment. DM was present in his history, but no other characteristic. At physical examination his general condition was good. He was conscious, lucid and cooperative, TA was 110/70 mmHg, pulse 90/min, RR 20/min and regular and SatO2 96. No foreign body was seen in the oral cavity or those parts of the oropharynx visible to the naked eye. Both hemithoraces contributed equally to respiration at pulmonary examination. There were no rales or rhonci at auscultation. Case 2 A 23-year-old male presented with cough, shortness of breath, hoarseness and a painful sensation when speaking developing after breakage of implant material from a dental surgery he was attending for implant treatment. No significant characteristic was present in his history. At physical examination his general condition was good, and he was lucid, oriented and cooperative. TA was 120/78 mmHg, pulse 88/min, RR 20/min and regular and SatO2 98. Oropharyngeal examination revealed a dental implant between the left upper palate and the 1 st and 2 nd molars; no foreign body was observed, however. Both hemithoraces contributed equally to respiration at pulmonary examination. There were no rales or rhonci at auscultation. Air passage and pulmonary X-rays were performed in both cases. Air passage X-ray in the first case revealed a dental needle in the hypopharynx at the level of the pyriform sinus; in the second case a piece of implant material was observed at the level of the epiglottis. Ethmoid forceps accompanied by a 70-degree endoscope were used in both cases, and the foreign bodies were extracted, from the posterior of the tonsillar pole in the 1 st case and from a left vallecula location in the 2 nd case. Control X-rays were normal, and after 4 hours observation both patients were discharged with appropriate advice with no additional problem."
