  "text": "After five lines of chemotherapy and 82 months following the first diagnosis, our patient with brain metastatic triple negative breast cancer had human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) genetic heterogeneity in the metastatic tissue sample interpreted as HER2 status conversion. After the removal of the metastasis, we started first line therapy for metastatic HER2 positive cancer with trastuzumab and paclitaxel. After the first cycle of trastuzumab, on day 8, she had a seizure, and neurosurgical examination showed an abscess-like lesion. The punctate proved to be sterile by microbiological and pathological examination, so we continued cytostatic therapy without the anti-HER2 antibody. 3 months later, we could not identify the previous abscess-like lesion in the control computer tomography (CT) scan, and our patient had no neurological deficits."
