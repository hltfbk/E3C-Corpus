  "text": "A 61-year-old Japanese woman had been treated for schizophrenia. She was moved to general hospital because of consciousness disturbance. She was prescribed trazodone (25 mg/day) for delirium and insomnia. After she was discharged, she returned to the psychiatric hospital with tardive dystonia. Her dystonia symptoms improved with 3 days of discontinuing trazodone."
