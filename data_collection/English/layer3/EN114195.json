  "text": "We experienced a case of 39-year-old male with diffuse bone pain and multiple fragility fractures caused by multiple FGF23-secreting tumors found in the hallux. Laboratory testing showed hypophosphatemia due to renal phosphate wasting and high levels of serum FGF23. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed three soft tissue tumors and an intraosseous tumor located in the right hallux. Systemic venous sampling of FGF23 revealed an elevation in the right common iliac vein and external iliac vein, which suggested that the tumors in the right hallux were responsible for overproduction of FGF23. Thereafter, these tumors were surgically removed and subjected to histopathological examinations. The three soft tissue tumors were diagnosed as phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors, which are known to be responsible for TIO. The fourth tumor had no tumor structure and was consisting of hyaline cartilage and bone tissue. Immediately after surgery, we noted a sharply decrease in serum level of FGF23, associated with an improved hypophosphatemia and a gradual relief of systematic pain that disappeared within two months of surgery."
