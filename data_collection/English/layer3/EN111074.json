  "text": "The patient was a 25-year-old female referred to our center with the chief complaint of severe abdominal pain and diarrhea for 2 years that had worsened from 2 months prior to admission. The clinical and para-clinical findings were in favor of mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy syndrome. Subsequent genetic studies revealed a novel, private, homozygous nonsense mutation in TYMP gene (c. 1013 C > A, p.S338X). Sanger sequencing confirmed the new mutation in the proband. Multiple sequence alignment showed high conservation of amino acids of this protein across different species."
