  "text": "Two patients presented with chronic conjunctival ulcerative and granulomatous lesions on the superior bulbar conjunctiva that repeatedly recurred after the mass was removed. The pathologic findings revealed the absence of malignant cells and presence of many lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. There was no evidence of acid-fast bacilli or fungal organisms. When a past history of blepharoplasty was established, microscopic examination revealed occult exposed suture tips. After the sutures were removed, the granuloma with necrosis was resolved within a month."
