  "text": "A 47-year-old patient has been undergoing maintenance HD for 32 years. The underline nephropathy was an undetermined chronic glomerular disease. He was anuric with no renal transplantation plan. There was a history of multiple blood transfusions during the first 5 years of HD and no scarification. Complications of ESRD included secondary hyperparathyroidism with parathyroidectomy in 2012 for refractory secondary hyperparathyroidism to medical treatment. Long-term complication of HD was beta 2 microglobulin amyloidosis with shoulder destructive arthropathy and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. He was tested negative for HIV and he had a naturally acquired hepatitis B immunity. Moreover, a chronic HCV genotype 1b infection was diagnosed at the 25 th year of HD treatment and there was no tendency for spontaneous resolution: positive HCV serology, positive HCV polymerase chain reaction, gradual increase of viral loads from 6.17x10 5 to 1.5x10 7 IU/ml and hepatic cytolysis (1.5 to 2 upper limit of normal). There were no signs of hepatocellular insufficiency or portal hypertension. The Liver remained homogenous with normal size and there was no extrahepatic HCV infection related manifestations. After a multidisciplinary approach and the written consent of the patient, a specific antiviral treatment with a Sofosbuvir based regimen was started. It featured: sofosbuvir and ledipasvir 400/90mg: 1 tablet daily for 3 months, the only DAAs combination currently available.\nEvolution was marked by the complete regression of the hepatic cytolysis syndrome, a complete and sustained virological response (SVR) with HCV viral load undetectable from the 12 th week of treatment to the time of this report (24 months later). No adverse reactions were reported."
