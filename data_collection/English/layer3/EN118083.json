  "text": "A 30-year-old man, of Asian origin, developed a hepatic tubercular abscess which was not associated with any pulmonary or gastrointestinal tract foci of tuberculosis. An ultrasonogram of the abdomen showed an abscess in the right lobe of his liver which was initially diagnosed as an amoebic liver abscess. Subsequently, the pus from the lesion yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis using the BACTEC TB 460 instrument and Mycobacterium tuberculosis deoxyribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction. The patient was started on systemic antitubercular therapy to which he responded favorably."
