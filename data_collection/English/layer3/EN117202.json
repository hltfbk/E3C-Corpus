  "text": "We present a case of a 66-year-old African man who presented to our emergency department with a mass protruding per anus with obstipation. During laparotomy, we found that the sigmoid colon had intussuscepted into the rectum and out from the anus. Other abdominal viscera were normal and without any obvious mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Sigmoid colectomy and spectacle colostomy were performed. Grossly, the excised bowel looked normal, but the histologic results showed features of necrosis and chronic inflammation."
