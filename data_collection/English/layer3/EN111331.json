  "text": "A 59â€‰year old female, nonsmoker, non-hypertensive, non-diabetic with a known history of GCA, temporal arteritis on prednisone presented with shortness of breath & chest pain. Chest CT revealed aortic arch IMH and large left hemothorax. CTA confirmed distal aortic arch focal dilation, a focal intimal irregularity in the distal aortic arch and extensive IMH without any active extravasation or signs of aortitis. Patient underwent an urgent TEVAR without oversizing the aortic landing zones. Post TEVAR aortogram showed exclusion of the site of IMH origin and dilated aortic arch segment by the stent and absence of active extravasation. One month post-TEVAR CTA showed patent stent graft with resolution of IMH and hemothorax. One year after TEVAR, patient remained asymptomatic."
