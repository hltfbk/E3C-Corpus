  "text": "We describe here a non-consanguineous Vietnamese family with Joubert syndrome, a fetus and 10-year-old developmentally delayed boy. Ultrasonography showed ventriculomegaly at 26 + 6 weeks of gestation in the fetus. The 10-year-old-boy was diagnosed with cerebral palsy of unknown origin. Clinical physical examination at the age of 10, he showed clinical features of Joubert syndrome including typical facial dysmorphism, ataxia, severe psychomotor delay, oculomotor apraxia and molar tooth sign on brain MRI. Whole exome sequencing analysis identified a novel compound heterozygous c.725A > G p.Asn242Ser and c.313-3 T > G p.Lys105Valfs*16 TMEM67 variant in the proband and the affected fetus. These two variants were inherited from each parent and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The variant c.725A > G p.Asn242Ser was previously documented in patients with JS, the novel splice-site c.313-3 T > G p.Lys105Valfs*16 TMEM67 variant produced an aberrant transcript with the loss of four nucleotides of exon 03."
