  "text": "A 60-year-old healthy female was referred to our department for dental implant therapy in the right posterior maxilla. Clinical examination revealed that the maxilla was edentulous from the right first premolar to the second molar region. Radiographically, atrophy of the maxillary alveolar ridge in the same tooth site was observed. Sinus membrane elevation and simultaneous implant placement were performed through the lateral approach. HA/PLLA mesh was utilized to maintain space under the elevated sinus membrane and as a fixation device to replace the bone window. Six months later, new bone was generated in the secluded space maintained under the elevated sinus membrane. When observed 42Â months after the implant insertion, bone volume around the implant apex had increased in vertical direction under the HA/PLLA mesh plate device, and there was continuous bone formation in the sinus over time."
