  "text": "A 23 year old female with giant cell tumor of sacrum was treated initially with conservative treatment (serial angioembolisation and bisphosphonates). Later intralesional curettage was done as the patient started developing bladder and bowel disturbances after two sessions of angioembolisation. Six months later patient again presented with pain at the primary lesion site and bilateral limb swelling. Imaging revealed recurrence of the disease and tumor thrombus extending into the inferior vena cava up to the subhepatic region."
