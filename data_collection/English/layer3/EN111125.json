  "text": "A 29-year-old man, with a history of intractable frontal lobe epilepsy refractory to seven anti-epileptic medications and subsequent intracranial surgery, underwent VNS implantation without complications. On beginning stimulation, he began to have intermittent chest pain that corresponded temporally to his intermittent VNS firing. The description of his pain was pathognomonic of ischemic cardiac chest pain. On initial evaluation, he displayed Levine's sign and reported crushing substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm, as well as shortness of breath walking upstairs that improved with rest. He underwent an extensive cardiac workup, including 12-lead ECG, cardiac stress test, echocardiogram, 12-day ambulatory cardiac monitoring, and continuous ECG monitoring each with and without stimulation of his device. The workup was consistently negative. Inability to resolve the pain necessitated the disabling and eventual removal of the device."
