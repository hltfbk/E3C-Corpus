  "text": "A 63-year-old male with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was found to have tumor thrombus formation in the arch of the azygos vein. Four courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the TP regimen (paclitaxel plus nedaplatin) were given. Reexamination revealed a significant reduction in tumor and tumor thrombus volume. Therefore, McKeown radical resection for esophageal cancer and removal of the tumor thrombus in the arch of the azygos vein were performed. Postoperative pathology suggested complete remission of the esophageal tumor and the presence of small focal cancer tissues in the arch of the azygos vein."
