  "text": "A six-year-old girl had presented at the age of eight months old with bronchiolitis followed by a persistent cough, dyspnea and hypoxaemia. She was found to have gastroesophageal reflux disease, but her symptoms did not resolve despite her therapy being optimised. Further tests, including a chest computed tomographic scan, lung biopsy and genetic testing, confirmed a diagnosis of surfactant protein C dysfunction."
