  "text": "A 46-year-old man with end-stage primary biliary cirrhosis was admitted to our hospital for evaluation as a candidate for living donor liver transplantation. The patient's younger sister, aged 43 years, was the only living donor candidate. The predicted left liver graft volume with the middle hepatic vein was found to be 403 mL using the region-growing method with 3D CT software. This volume was sufficiently large for the recipient because the standard liver volume of the recipient was 1095 mL. 3D CT angiography was performed twice but could not reveal the anatomical structure of the left and middle hepatic arteries. However, simulation using the region-growing method demonstrated individual branching off of A2, A3, and A4 from the PHA; conventional angiography demonstrated the same results. Each branch was approximately 1 mm in diameter, which was too small for secure anastomosis. Therefore, we selected the right liver graft for simplicity. The postoperative course of the donor and recipient was uneventful, and they were discharged on postoperative days 10 and 46, respectively."
