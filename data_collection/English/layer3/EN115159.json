  "text": "A 17-year-old adolescent boy of Sri Lankan Moor heritage was taking long-term immunosuppressants for nephrotic syndrome. He presented to hospital with focal fits affecting his left arm. He later developed choreiform movements of the same arm, progressing to epilepsia partialis continua and weakness. The gradually evolving focal neurological signs and underlying immunosuppression raised the possibility of localized cerebral infection or inflammation. Analysis of his cerebrospinal fluid showed lymphocytosis with normal cellular morphology. Magnetic resonance imaging was suggestive of progressive vasculitic infarctions of the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. There was no evidence of active autoimmune or viral disease on hematological investigations, but molecular amplification detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis in his cerebrospinal fluid. Although our patient had been established on isoniazid preventive treatment for eight months before the episode, tuberculosis was nonetheless considered to be the most likely cause of the cerebral vasculitis. He was treated with a trial of anti-tuberculosis treatment, including streptomycin and adjunctive steroids, and made an uneventful recovery."
