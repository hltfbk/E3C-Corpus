  "text": "A 44-year-old man had been treated for more than 6 years with peritoneal dialysis for chronic kidney disease stage-V. Abdominal computed tomography and electronic colonoscopy revealed an appendiceal fossa with adjacent fistula. The peritoneal dialysis catheter was removed, and the patient recovered with no recurrence of complications."
