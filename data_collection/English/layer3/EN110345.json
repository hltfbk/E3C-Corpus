  "text": "Case 1: an 71-year-old male patient had been admitted to our department with two-week history of gradually increasing headache and slight limb activity disorder and a 2-month history of minor head trauma as a result of fall to the ground. Cranial CT revealed bilateral CSDH. There was hypertension and multiple lacunar infarction were the systemic diseases which were under normal control (Table 1). Chest radiography, electrocardiogram and the blood system examinations were completed preoperatively. Fortunately, the major data was not exceptional remarkably and preoperative coagulation parameters were within normal limits. The patient underwent an urgent operation of burr hole drainage of CSDH in bilateral frontal-temporal region. During the operation, subdural hematoma launched from bone hole after the opening of the dura in spite of over high intracranial pressure (ICP). The procedure was completed without any obvious accident and the vital signs remained stable during operation. Eventually, a subdural closed system of drainage was placed when intracranial pneumatosis was eliminated absolutely. Because of the exacerbation of conscious disturbance, emergent CT scan was taken at 2 hours postoperatively and revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhage. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Surgical intervention was not adopted, and the patient kept to conservative treatment including continuous neurological observation for 6 days in the NICU. The hospitalization time was prolonged to 20 days because of mental disturbance after the operation which was corrected successfully in that interval. Finally, the patient was discharged from hospital with no neurological deficit except for slight language barriers. At 2-month follow-up no abnormality was noted, and the CT scan revealed hematoma was absorbed completely.\nCase 2: in case 2 we reported an 82-years-old man had been admitted to our department due to limbs weakness presented progressive aggravation with undergoing frequent falls in the previous month and a history of cerebral infarction, arterial hypertension and coronary heart disease with long-term oral rivaroxaban. The CT scan showed a right equi-density subdural hematoma and brain tissue compression. The neurologic evaluation revealed slow response and weakness of the left limbs (Table 1). The urgent evacuation of the subdural hematoma was performed with a single parietal burr-hole craniectomy on the right side without discontinuing oral rivaroxaban. A subdural drainage catheter was positioned in prefrontal region routinely. Surprisingly, we observed right visual field defect the following day and vital signs was remained within normal range all the time. The post-operative CT scan showed a bit of prefrontal pneumocephalus and right occipital lobe hemorrhage and no acute bleedings in ipsilateral subdural space. The drainage tube removal was delayed to the fourth day. Meanwhile, the CT findings occipital hematoma appeared absorbed gradually and did not require surgical intervention. The neurologic evaluation revealed a slight postural instability and for this reason that the patient was arranged to physical therapy. At two-month follow-up, the patient was able to walk unaided, and the review CT scan was normal.\nCase 3: in case 3 we reported an 80-years-old man had been admitted to our department due to moderate dizziness and headache for 20 days with a history of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Neurological assessment confirmed mental confusion and gait imbalance without focal deficits. The CT scan revealed a sizeable right chronic subdural hematoma which caused midline left shift (Table 1). The patient underwent an instant single burr-hole craniectomy and the right subdural hematoma evacuation was satisfactory largely. A subdural drainage apparatus was positioned routinely. On the second day after surgery, sudden airways spasm occurred and blood oxygen saturation presented unstable within a short time. Emergency tracheal incubation was implemented to maintain vital signs. Simultaneously, the drainage device was closed and a emergent CT scan was performed and revealed the presence of a small area occipital intraparenchymal hemorrhage. On the third day, the patient was transferred to the ICU and assisted respiration with ventilator postoperatively. Subsequently, the patient was required tracheotomy due to difficulty of removing trachea cannula within a short time. The drainage tube removal was delayed to the fifth day postoperatively. After one week, the patient successfully detached from the respirator and returned to general ward to continue anti-infective treatment for 10 days. Finally, the patient discharged from hospital with mild pulmonary inflammation, but therapeutic process was uneventful, and the total hospitalization time was up to one month. The two-month follow-up showed the patient was in good conditions and life-independent. The CT scan of the head revealed no recurrence."
