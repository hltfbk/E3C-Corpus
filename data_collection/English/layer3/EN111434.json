  "text": "A 48-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital for cellulitis of the right lower extremity. After antibiotic treatment, she developed pain and swelling of the left lower extremity, and deep vein thrombosis of both lower extremities was diagnosed. She was treated with a continuous heparin injection; subsequently, oral warfarin was concomitantly administered. Heparin was terminated after the therapeutic range was reached. On the following day, the patient had swelling and pain in the left lower extremity. In addition to decrease in protein S activity due to systemic lupus erythematosus, warfarin also reduced protein C activity, resulting in further hypercoagulation and skin necrosis. Warfarin was discontinued, and continuous heparin injection was resumed. Although the patient had to undergo amputation of the distal end of her left foot, continuous heparin injection was switched to oral rivaroxaban, and she was eventually discharged from the hospital in remission."
