  "text": "A 66-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, and parkinsonism was brought into the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital. She has undergone a procedure for proximal femur nailing on her left hip in 2013 due to a trauma-related fracture. However, after the development of a series of complications, she underwent revision surgery on her left hip 6 times by different surgeons. This included surgeries for implant removal and fixation of a custom-made bipolar hemi-replacement hip, followed by a cemented bipolar hip hemi- replacement with plating and cerclage wires followed by infection, the treatment of which entailed implant removal and placement of an antibiotic cement. This was followed by a long stem constrained cemented total hip arthroplasty which also failed. The surgeon then made the decision to perform a TFA. 12-month follow-up post-operatively showed neither peri-prosthetic infection or inflammation nor any leg length discrepancy. The functional outcome on lower extremity function scale showed improvement from 0 pre-operatively to 31 at 12-month follow- up."
