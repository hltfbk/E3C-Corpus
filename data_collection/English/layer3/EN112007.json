  "text": "We present two adult cases who aged 47 years and 19 years with slow growing masses beginning from their childhood in the posterior craniocervical area. On CT and MR imaging, the tumours showed as the superficially located lesions with ill-defined margins that involved the subcutaneous layer and its underlying muscles. The size of the lesions were 21.3 × 16.7 × 16 cm in case 1 and 20.2 × 19.3 × 13.6 cm in case 2. The tumours demonstrated heterogeneous intensities/signals with the adipose tissue presenting as the disperse strands or small focus of fatty intensity/signal. Parallel or whirling appearance, and dilated vessels were delineated in the cases. Contrast enhancement was administered in case 1 and marked enhancement was found."
