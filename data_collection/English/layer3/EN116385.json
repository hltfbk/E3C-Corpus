  "text": "A 48-year-old premenopausal woman of Caucasian origin was delivered adjuvant pelvic and inguinal radiotherapy after prior complete left Bartholin's gland tumor excision and inguinal lymph node dissection for adenoid cystic carcinoma of Bartholin's gland with one metastatic inguinal lymph node.Two years after primary treatment, she presented to the Emergency Room with acute headache, hypoacousia, decrease in visual acuity, and a decrease in right leg muscle strength. A cranial magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated three cystic brain lesions with associated perifocal edema. Chest and abdomen computed tomography scans and a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the pelvis did not find any metastatic or residual disease elsewhere. A physical examination found no local recurrence.Stereotactic brain biopsies with pathology examination revealed the presence of adenoid cystic carcinoma metastasis. She thus received 30Gy of brain radiotherapy but, three months later, the brain lesions did not decrease in size and left mid lobular lung lesions appeared on her chest computed tomography scan. A mid left lobe lung excision was undertaken followed by chemotherapy consisting of six cycles of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and cisplatin. Five months after beginning chemotherapy, the brain disease progressed and our patient died."
