  "text": "Diffuse white matter changes with the character of a leukoencephalopathy were seen, which strictly interested only the right cerebral hemisphere. The parents referred that she suffered from an indoor lightning strike at age of seven months, although she survived with almost no external burns or signs, and recovered uneventfully at that time. A discussion over the effects of electrocution and lightning strike on the human body in general, and over the nervous system, is made. Particular attention must be shown when making the differential diagnosis of leukoencephalopathies with a strictly one-hemisphere extension since several other conditions might resemble each other under the radiological aspect, here including brain viral infections, genetic disorders, and so on."
