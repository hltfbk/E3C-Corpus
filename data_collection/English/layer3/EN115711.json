  "text": "We find such a rare and perplexing case in a 19 year boy who presented with painful swellings of both achilles tendons causing signification limitation of walking distance. This was initially interpreted as a localized benign disorder and was offered surgical treatment. Excision of the swollen achilles tendon followed by reconstruction using peroneus brevis tendon was done, first on the more symptomatic right side. The diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was made retrospectively after histopathological as well as biochemical analyses and appropriate medical therapy was initiated."
