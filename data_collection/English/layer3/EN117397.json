  "text": "Following laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone disease, a seventy eight year old healthy white male broke out in painful erythema on either side of his epigastric port site. Vesicles akin to a partial thickness burns were revealed upon removal of dressings. An unusual indentation created by the dressing, and skin traction by the dressing's adhesive edges were implicated, raising questions about technique of its application."
