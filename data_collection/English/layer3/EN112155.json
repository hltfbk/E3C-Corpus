  "text": "We present here a unique case of PMHE arising primarily in the vulva of a 51-year-old woman who presented with a painful vulvar nodule. Clinically, it was thought as Bartholin gland cyst, vulvar hematoma or papilloma. On surgery, two nodules were found with one located in the superficial dermis and the other in the deep subcutis. Histologically, these two nodules showed similar features, composed of fascicles or sheets of plump spindled to epithelioid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Given the morphological resemblance to a myogenic tumor, the lesion was initially diagnosed as a rhabdomyosarcoma by the referring pathologist. However, a comprehensive reevaluation of the submitted slides made us reconsider a PMHE, which was subsequently confirmed by immunohistochemical study."
