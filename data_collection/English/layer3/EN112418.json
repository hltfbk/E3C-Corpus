  "text": "A 68-year-old woman presented with a huge ovarian tumor with a clinical diagnosis of malignant tumor of the ovary. She underwent hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, omentectomy and lymphadenectomy. Histologically, the tumor cells showed undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma as the sarcomatous component and squamous cell carcinoma as the carcinomatous component. The final diagnosis was ovarian carcinosarcoma with squamous cell carcinoma in the carcinomatous component, stage IIIA1. Postoperatively, the patient was treated with six cycles of combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin as adjuvant therapy. The patient was free of disease at 45â€‰months' follow-up consultation."
