  "text": "We present the case of a 34-year-old Caucasian woman with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer in the liver who achieved prolonged complete remission within six months of receiving trastuzumab (Herceptin) in combination with vinorelbine and gemcitabine. The patient remains in complete remission seven years later and continues to receive trastuzumab as maintenance therapy."
