  "text": "We report the case of a 51-year-old Moroccan malen admitted for a non-reducible right inguinal hernia in which surgical exploration showed the presence of a small bowel tumor that had migrated into his hernia sac. A histopathological examination of the tumor was in favor of a small bowel schwannoma."
