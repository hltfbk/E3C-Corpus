  "text": "A 38-year old woman, mother of three children was referred to our gynecological emergencies with an acute onset of persistent sharp right lower quadrant pain as well as nausea and vomiting. Her gynecological exam findings were right lower quadrant pain and rebound tenderness with right lateral uterine wheelbase. Sonographic evaluation revealed a 100/52mm right oblong adnexal cyst, clearly separated from the ipsilateral ovary suggesting a hydrosalpinx. The patient underwent laparotomy due to a torsion indicated by the clinical and paraclinical examination. We opted for laparotomy for two reasons.First, the patient had a triple cicatricial uterus. Second, laparoscopy colomn is not available at the emergencies. During the surgery, a 10cm twisted right paratubal cyst and normal bilateral ovaries were diagnosed. Cystectomy was performed without rupture and the cyst was sent to pathology. Grossly, the paraovarian cyst measured 10X5cm, contained serous fluid, rare papillary projections measuring 0,5cm were noted in the outer surface of the cyst. Histologically, papillary epithelial proliferation was recognized. The epithelium showed nuclear stratification, gland formation and atypical papillary proliferations. No invasive features were recognized. The tumor was pathologically diagnosed as borderline serous papillary tumor within PC. Abdominal pelvic CT scan and tumor markers (CA125) were normal. The patient underwent radical surgery: washings, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, biopsies. During the final pathology review, no metastatic disease was observed. After one year of follow up, the patient was free of disease recurrence"
