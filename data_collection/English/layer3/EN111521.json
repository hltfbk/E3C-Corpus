  "text": "A 64-year-old male who underwent PTCA was given ticagrelor. A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a QTc of 402 ms. He returned after 1.5 months with complaints of shortness of breath. An ECG revealed a prolonged QTc of 468 ms. Ticagrelor was discontinued in view of ticagrelor-induced dyspnea and the patient was started on clopidogrel. The other medications were kept unchanged. The patient returned after a month without any complaints. A follow-up ECG showed a reduced QTc of 425 ms."
