  "text": "We present the case of a 55-year old man who presented with jaundice and severe hepatic injury approximately 6 months after starting bupropion for smoking cessation. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a mixed picture of hepatocellular injury and cholestasis. Liver biopsy demonstrated findings consistent with severe hepatotoxic injury due to drug induced liver injury. Laboratory testing was also notable for positive autoimmune markers. The patient initially had clinical improvement with steroid therapy but eventually died of infectious complications."
