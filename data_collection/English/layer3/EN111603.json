  "text": "A 62-year-old man experienced repeated twitching of both hands in recent 10 years. On July 28, 2017, the patient was admitted to our hospital due to slow response and speech difficulties. On medical examinations, he had a positive Chvostek sign, while no Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy signs or history of neck surgery or radiation, and his family members had no similar medical history. Laboratory examinations revealed hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Computed tomography revealed basal ganglia calcification. Based on these investigations, a diagnosis of Fahr's syndrome due to hypoparathyroidism was suggested. After receiving intravenous calcium gluconate to relieve symptoms, the patient continued to take oral calcium carbonate and calcitriol for treatment."
