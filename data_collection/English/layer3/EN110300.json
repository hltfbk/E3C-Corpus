  "text": "Case 1 A 25-year-old previously healthy male patient, presented with a five-month history of abdominal pain and slowly enlarged, palpable, non-tender upper abdominal mass. Physical examination of the patient disclosed a firm abdominal mass. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a well-defined heterogeneous mass involving the pancreatic tail with peripheral calcifications. Laboratory examinations demonstrated normal levels of pancreatic enzymes and normal liver function test results. The serum tumour markers were not performed. The patient underwent distal splenopancreatectomy. Macroscopically, the pancreatic tumour was encapsulated measuring 14 x 7 cm. On cut section, it showed mainly solid and partially cystic components and demonstrated focal haemorrhage and central necrosis. Histologically, the tumour was circumscribed by a thick fibrous capsule. The growth pattern of the tumour was heterogeneous with a combination of soild, pseudopapillary and haemorrhagic-necrotic pseudocystic structures. The solid areas were composed of poorly cohesive monomorphic cells that were admixed with hyalinized stromal bands containing thin-walled blood vessels surrounded by loosely cohesive tumour cells radiating around blood vessels reminiscent of pseudorosettes in ependymoma. Cholesterol clefts as well as clusters of foamy histiocytes were focally noted. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells showed positive immunostaining with CD56, CD10, β-catenin, progesterone receptor and synaptophysin focally. They were negative for chromogranin and cytokeratin. The final pathological diagnosis was SPT. No adjuvant therapy was administered. On postoperative day 8, the patient developed abscess of the abdominal wall and peritoneal collection. Case 2 A 20-year-old male patient with no particular past medical history, presented with epigastric pain for the past two months. Physical examination and laboratory tests were within normal limits. Abdominal CT scan showed a well-circumscribed cystic mass involving the body of the pancreas with heterogeneous enhancement. The patient underwent distal splenopancreatectomy. Macroscopically, the pancreatic tumour was encapsulated measuring 5 x 3,5 cm. On cut section, it showed mainly cystic and partially solid components and demonstrated diffuse haemorrhage and necrosis. Histologically, the tumour was circumscribed by a thick fibrous capsule. The growth pattern of the tumour was heterogeneous with a combination of soild, pseudopapillary and haemorrhagic-necrotic pseudocystic structures. The solid areas were composed of poorly cohesive tumour cells radiating around blood vessels reminiscent of pseudorosettes in ependymoma. Cholesterol clefts as well as clusters of foamy histiocytes were not identified. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells showed positive immunostaining with CD56, vimentin, NSE, β-catenin, progesterone receptor. They were negative for chromogranin and synaptophysin. The final pathological diagnosis was SPT. No adjuvant therapy was administered. Postoperative course was uneventful. At present, the patient is still being followed up."
