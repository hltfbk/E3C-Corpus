  "text": "A 19-year-old male was found comatose at home and brought to hospital in a deep coma, shock, hypoxia, and acidosis. Brain magnetic resonant imaging (MRI) revealed a strikingly selective white matter injury early in the course of the disease. The patient remained in a comatose state with no signs of neurologic recovery until he died few weeks later following an increase in the brain edema and herniation."
