  "text": "A 17-year-old Malay female with SJS suffered from bilateral pneumothoraces, pneumomediastinum, and obstructive uropathy as early complications of her disease. She required intubation, chest tube insertion, and bilateral ureteric stenting as part of her intensive care management. These extra-cutaneous complications of renal and pulmonary systems were likely secondary to widespread epithelial detachment."
