  "text": "We present the case of a 72-year-old female who had longstanding history of low back pain that exacerbated 20 days prior to the presentation to the emergency room with a frank cauda equina syndrome. The lumbar computed tomography scan showed a hyperdense lesion, suggestive of calcified tumor, whereas the magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hypointense lesion on theT1 and T2-weighted images, without contrast enhancement or edema on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. She underwent an emergent L2-L4 laminectomy and L3-L4 discectomy with resection of L2 intradural tumor, following which she regained normal function."
