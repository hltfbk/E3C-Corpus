  "text": "A 36-year-old female presented to her primary care physician with new-onset progressive right lower quadrant pain without any significant past medical or family history. Computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a 4.9 × 3.5 × 3.1 cm, lobulated, septated cystic mass arising from the cecum. The mass demonstrated wall enhancement and contained focal areas of coarse calcification. There was nodal involvement either locally or distally. The patient underwent right hemicolectomy, and pathology revealed a high-grade mucinous carcinoma with signet-ring cell variant invading through the muscularis propria and into the subserosal adipose tissue. The margins were negative for tumor, and no lymphovascular or perineural invasion was noted. None of the 14 resected pericolonic lymph nodes was positive for malignancy. Hence, she was staged as pT3, pN0, pMx-stage IIA. The appendix was not involved. Microsatellite instability testing showed the preservation of MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 proteins by IHC and PCR. Carcinoembryonic antigen level was within normal limits. Due to the patient's young age, aggressive histology and microsatellite-stable status, adjuvant fluropyrimidine (5-FU)-based therapy with the single agent capecitabine was initiated. The patient completed 6 months of adjuvant therapy and has been disease free for approximately 18 months."
