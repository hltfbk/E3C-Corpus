  "text": "In November 1999, a 63-year-old Caucasian woman from Italy with a history of symptomatic left knee osteoarthritis underwent a total knee arthroplasty. In March 2008, while rising from a chair, she felt a sudden pain and instability in her left knee. She reported a fracture of the polyethylene post of the tibial insert. No malposition or malalignment of either the femoral or tibial components were identified. The polyethylene tibial insert was studied under light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The fracture was also noted to have occurred without any notable polyethylene wear."
