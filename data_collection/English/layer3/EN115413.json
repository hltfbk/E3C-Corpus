  "text": "A 67-year-old South-Asian female previously diagnosed and treated for psoriasis presented with a four month history of abdominal pain associated with abdominal distension. Clinical examination revealed an enlarged spleen and free fluid in the abdomen. Imaging with ultrasonography and computed tomography of the abdomen revealed features compatible with chronic portal vein thrombosis with cavernous transformation."
