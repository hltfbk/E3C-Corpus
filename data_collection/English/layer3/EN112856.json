  "text": "We report here a confirmed case of Lassa fever whose diagnosis could not be suspected until 11 days after the symptomatology began. This case was recognized as a suspected case of Lassa fever in the Internal Medicine Department of the Regional and Teaching Hospital of Borgou due to the persistence of the fever and the worsening of the patient's clinical condition despite triple antibiotic therapy in general and especially due to the appearance of hemorrhages. Confirmation of the presence of Lassa fever virus by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay on blood sample was obtained after his death despite late initiation of Ribavirin treatment."
