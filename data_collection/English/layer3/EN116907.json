  "text": "We present the case of a 72-year-old Caucasian woman with Dukes A colorectal cancer at diagnosis and, three years later, a single secondary subcutaneous involvement with no other metastatic sites. The description of this case is supported by critical analysis of its clinical, radiological and pathological features. Our report illustrates that diagnosis can be difficult and controversial when relapse occurs in early stage patients and at uncommon sites."
