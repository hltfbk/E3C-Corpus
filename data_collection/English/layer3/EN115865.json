  "text": "Two female patients, aged 27 and 35 years, were injured in motor vehicle accidents and did not have neurological deficits except for slight numbness in the thighs in one case. Radiologic examinations showed nearly complete fracture-dislocations at T7-8 and L1-2, respectively. In both cases, subtotal corpectomies and anterior reconstructions using Kaneda devices were performed after laminectomy in the lateral decubitus position. No neurological deterioration was observed after surgery."
