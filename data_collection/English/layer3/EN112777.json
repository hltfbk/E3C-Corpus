  "text": "A Caucasian 83-year-old woman slipped and fell, complaining of the left hip pain. After radiographic evaluation, she was diagnosed with an intertrochanteric fracture that occurred in a long-term arthrodesed hip. We treated this rare presentation by open reduction and internal fixation with a proximal locking femoral plate and a pelvic reconstruction plate. No immobilization was needed in the post-operative care. Fracture healing occurred after 3months."
