  "text": "we report a case of late hemoptysis secondary to severe PV stenosis in a man who underwent AF ablation 9 months before onset of symptoms. He presented four episodes of bleeding and developed an acute respiratory failure (ARF). Parameters of respiratory mechanics and medical investigation did not show any abnormalities. Only computed tomography (CT) angiography showed stenosis of 3 out of 4 native PVs. PV balloon dilatation in all affected PVs and a stent was implanted in 1 of the 3 PVs with full restoration of respiratory function during 1 year follow-up."
