  "text": "We present a case of a 38-year-old male patient with fever, chills, shortness of breath and a tender warm swelling on his right thigh. Ultrasound of the thigh lesion showed the classical filarial dance sign. Subsequently FNAC from the lesion documented microfilaria in spite of absent peripheral blood eosinophilia and microfilaria. The patient underwent an incision and drainage of the thigh lesion and was treated with ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine. He was subsequently admitted to the medical ward and discharged home after two weeks in a stable condition."
