  "text": "Assisted reproductive technology was planned for a 29-year-old nulligravida Japanese woman diagnosed with bilateral fallopian tube obstruction and right-sided hydrosalpinx. On day 1 of controlled ovarian stimulation, the result of her human chorionic gonadotropin urine test was negative, and her serum levels of luteinizing hormone, estradiol, and progesterone were normal. On day 11 of controlled ovarian stimulation, the levels of estradiol and progesterone had risen to 9679 pg/ml and 16 ng/ml, respectively, prompting suspension of controlled ovarian stimulation. Eleven days after controlled ovarian stimulation was suspended, the patient demonstrated ascites that did not improve despite administration of cabergoline, and she was transported to our hospital 2 days after. Late-onset ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome suggested that she was pregnant, and her serum human chorionic gonadotropin level was 27,778 IU/ml. She underwent laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy and was diagnosed with right tubal pregnancy."
