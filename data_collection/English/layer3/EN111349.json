  "text": "A 9-year-old boy was referred complaining of pain in the mandibular left central incisor. After radiographic examination, an invagination into the pulp chamber of the tooth associated with periapical radiolucency was detected. Endodontic access was performed and the orifice was identified under a dental operating microscope. The invagination area was chemo-mechanically cleaned. After 1â€‰week, the invagination was obturated with mineral trioxide aggregate. During the 2-year follow up period, the tooth was asymptomatic. Radiographic examination revealed significant progression of periapical healing and root development in the main root canal of the tooth."
