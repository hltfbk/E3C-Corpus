  "text": "A two-and-half-year-old Caucasian girl with VACTERL spectrum presented with hematemesis and abdominal distension. She had caput medusae, ascites, splenomegaly, gastric and esophageal varices. Her liver function tests were within normal limits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver with contrast showed a thready portal vein with collateral vessels involving both right and left portal veins without intrahepatic duct dilation."
