  "text": "A 77-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was referred for surgical treatment for mitral valve regurgitation and underwent a minimally invasive mitral valve repair via a right mini-thoracotomy (MICS mitral procedure). On admission, laboratory results showed a leukocyte count of 1500/μL and neutrophils at 190/μL. Prior to surgery, a subcutaneous injection of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was given, based on a diagnosis of MDS by a hematologist. The MICS-mitral procedure using artificial chordae and an annular ring prosthesis was completed without requiring re-exploration for bleeding. Postoperatively, a G-CSF injection was administered and transfusion was required. There was no infection complication and the postoperative course was uneventful."
