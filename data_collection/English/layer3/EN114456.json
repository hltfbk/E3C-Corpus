  "text": "A case of P. falciparum clinical failure with DP at day 20 was described in a 104 kg French soldier deployed in Djibouti. He was admitted to hospital for supervision of oral treatment with DP [40 mg dihydroartemisinin (DHA) plus 320 mg piperaquine tetraphosphate (PPQ)]. This corresponded to a cumulative dose of 4.6 mg/kg DHA and 37 mg/kg PPQ in the present patient, which is far below the WHO recommended ranges. No mutation was found in the propeller domain of the Kelch 13 (k13) gene, which is associated with artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia. Pfmdr1 N86, 184F, S1034 and N1042 polymorphisms and haplotype 72-76 CVIET for the pfcrt gene were found in the present case. There was no evidence of resistance to DP."
