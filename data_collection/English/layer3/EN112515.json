  "text": "However, here we report a case of DNPE with a slightly different presentation where there is no preceding trauma and has symptoms that mimic severe pneumonia. He presented with high fever, dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain. Despite on 10 L of oxygen supplementation via high flow mask and already given bolus intravenous antibiotic, the patient still tachypnoeic and was persistently in type I respiratory failure. His chest X-ray showed consolidative changes. Upon further investigation revealed no evidence of DVT on Doppler ultrasound and normal D-dimer level. Due to the high index of suspicion by the attending physician, PE was suspected and later confirmed with computed tomography pulmonary angiography scan. He was successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy. The objective of this case report is to share the difficult experience of diagnosing PE when the presentation highly atypical and mimics severe pneumonia."
