  "text": "Here, we report a 29-year-old patient with a locally advanced HLRCC-assiciated RCC. He was administrated temsirolimus initially, then underwent surgical removal of kidney, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, inferior vena cava and tumor thrombi. Unfortunately, multiple liver metastases were confirmed 1 month after surgery, so axitinib was given but failed immediately. We tried bevacizumab plus erlotinib, which achieved long-term good response lasting more than 18â€‰months. He is alive with disease and maintains bevacizumab plus erlotinib treatment."
