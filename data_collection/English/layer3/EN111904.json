  "text": "In the current report, a 55-year-old female was admitted in our hospital for evaluation of right eye epiphora and right nasal intermittent bleeding. Imaging examination revealed a large soft tissue mass in the right nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus. After an explorative surgery, the pathological findings confirmed the presentation of sinonasal DSRCT. Immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic studies confirmed the diagnosis of DSRCT in this patient. Surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy was performed, and she died 2â€‰months after operation."
