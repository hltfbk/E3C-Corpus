  "text": "The study follows the case of a 3-year-old boy presenting recurrent patellar dislocation and PVNS. Due to symptoms such as chronic arthritis, he had been taking prednisolone and methotrexate for 6Â months before receiving a definitive diagnosis. After a period of showing no improvements from his treatment, he was referred to our center and was diagnosed with local PVNS using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient was treated for his patellar dislocation by way of open synovectomy, lateral retinacular release, and a proximal realignment procedure, with no recurrence after a 24-month follow-up."
