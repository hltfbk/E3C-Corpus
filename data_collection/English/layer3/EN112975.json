  "text": "This is a retrospective case study of a 37-year-old man with multiple lifestyle risk factors (chronic marijuana and tobacco abuse), who suffered a thalamomesencephalic stroke, rapidly worsening to comatose state. After restoration of consciousness, he clinically manifested with left paramedian midbrain syndrome. Imaging demonstrated an asymmetric paramedian thalamic infarction with mesencephalon extension, patency of the basilar, vertebral arteries, and left PCA and right-sided FPCA, respectively. Left-sided thalamoperforating arterioles were not differentiated; AOP was inferred. Neither evident clinical source of embolus nor prothrombotic states were found. Mobile cardiac telemetry and transesophageal echocardiography were not available. The diagnosis was established too late for thrombolytic treatment. Anticoagulation was indicated during the acute and subacute stages, followed by low dose of antiplatelet."
