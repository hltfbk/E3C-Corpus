  "text": "Sixty five year old lady presented with swelling in left inguinal region of six months duration. She gave a past history of swelling around medial condyle of left femur eight years back. Swelling was excised three times. At the time of third recurrence, swelling was extensive, infiltrating surrounding tissues and underlying bone, encasing femoral and popliteal vessels for which she underwent an above knee amputation. She now presented with inguinal swelling measuring 5.7Ã—3.0 cms. Positron Emission Tomography Scan (PET-CT) revealed multiple enlarged left common iliac, internal and external iliac nodes, largest measuring 7.0 cms. Both the inguinal and pelvic nodes were excised. Lesion was diagnosed as metastatic deposits of Malignant pigmented villonodular synovitis based on morphological and Immunohistochemical findings."
