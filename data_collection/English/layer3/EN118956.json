  "text": "A 46 year old women presented with abdominal pain and diarrhea. A three-dimensional (3-D) pancreas protocol computed tomography scan revealed an 18 x 12 cm pancreatic VIPoma abutting the liver, stomach, spleen, left adrenal, colon that also invaded the distal duodenum - proximal jejunum at the ligament of Treitz in association with sinistral portal hypertension. Following preoperative proximal splenic artery embolization, the patient with underwent successful en bloc resection of the locally advanced VIPoma in conjunction with a diaphragmatic resection, total gastrectomy, splenectomy, left adrenalectomy, as well as small and large bowel resection. The estimated blood loss was 500 ml. All margins were negative (R0 resection). The patient is alive and disease-free."
