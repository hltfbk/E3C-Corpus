  "text": "We present the case of an 11-year-old British Caucasian girl with Smith-Magenis syndrome who developed a severe, progressive thoracic and lumbar scoliosis measuring 85 degrees and 80 degrees , respectively. She had no cardiac or renal anomalies. Brace treatment was unsuccessful to prevent deterioration of the scoliosis. Both curves were rigid on supine maximum side-bending and traction radiographs. Our patient underwent a posterior spinal arthrodesis with pedicle screw/hook and rod instrumentation and autologous iliac crest graft, supplemented by allograft bone. She had an uneventful postoperative course other than the development of a small wound dehiscence which required resuturing with no signs of a wound infection. A good correction of both scoliotic curvatures to 45 degrees and 40 degrees and a balanced spine in both the coronal and sagittal planes was achieved. Follow-up to skeletal maturity (4 years post-surgery) showed no loss of deformity correction, no detected pseudarthrosis and a good clinical outcome."
