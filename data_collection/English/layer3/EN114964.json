  "text": "We report a case of the prolapse of the fimbrial end of a fallopian tube through an abdominal scar after caesarean section mimicking scar endometriosis. A 24-year-old primipara South Asian woman of Punjabi ethnicity presented to our institute with a fleshy mass protruding through her abdominal scar and bleeding from the mass during menstruation for the past 5 months. She underwent a caesarean section 6 months earlier for breech presentation. Her history revealed she had wound dehiscence on the sixth postoperative day. The major portion of her wound healed in 1 month leaving a 2 cm area in the middle of her vertical scar. An abdominal examination revealed a 2Ã—2 cm fleshy mass protruding through the middle part of her infraumbilical abdominal scar. At the time of the surgery we found that the fimbrial end of her left fallopian tube was protruding through her abdominal scar."
