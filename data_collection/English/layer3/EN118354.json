  "text": "A case is presented of a female who presented with recurrent syncope, cyanosis and then circulatory shock. An intravascular and intracardiac mass was suspected. Due to refractory shock, she ultimately underwent single stage median sternotomy and exploratory laparotomy, with excision of an intravascular leiomyoma."
