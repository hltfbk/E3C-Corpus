  "text": "A 22-year-old Chinese female presented to our medical center with high spiking fever for one week, myalgia for two weeks, and arthralgia and pink maculopapular rash for four weeks. She developed disseminated intravascular coagulation on the fourth day after admission. There was no other explanation for the fever and rash, including infection, malignancy, and collagenosis. Together, the high spiking fever, salmon-colored rash, splenomegaly, and excess hepatic enzyme, indicated adult-onset Still's disease based on the Yamaguchi criteria. Therefore, prednisolone therapy was initiated. The combination of nafamostat mesilate and prednisolone therapies caused a rapid reduction in the fever and rash. The inflammatory markers decreased immediately, and disseminated intravascular coagulation improved. Her symptoms resolved with low-dose prednisolone treatment, and she was monitored thereafter at our outpatient clinic."
