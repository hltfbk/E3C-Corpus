  "text": "A 76-year-old woman with no history of cerebrovascular symptoms or cervical trauma was admitted to our hospital with a pulsatile left neck mass for five months before referral. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile solid cervical mass located anterior to the left sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle. There was no audible bruit over the carotid region. Diagnosis of extracranial internal carotid artery aneurysm was evocated. Duplex ultrasonography and-computed tomography scan (angio-CT scan) demonstrated a saccular aneurysm at the origin of the left Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) with a longitudinal diameter of 28mm and transversal diameters of 25,1mm x 25mm, the left carotid axis appeared free from calcific or stenotic plaque. In addition no obstructive or aneurysmal lesions of the contralateral carotid artery were detected. Laboratory tests were normal. The aneurysm was surgically treated under general anesthesia. The aneurysm was dissected and exposed by standard lateral cervical approach anterior to the SCM muscle. Simple proximal and distal arterial clamping after systemic administration of heparin (at 100 IU/kg body weight) was used during aneurysm repair. After aneurysmectomy end-to-end anastomosis of the ICA was performed because the distal carotid artery was significantly elongated and was of sufficient length. The time of carotid clamping was 25 minutes. No perioperative complications were encountered. Pathological study of the aneurysmatic carotid wall revealed fibromuscular dysplasia associated with thinning of the arterial wall, which was partially replaced with collagen fibers and proliferated smooth muscle cell bundles. The Patient was discharged from hospital on the fifth postoperative day without any neurological deficit. At one year follow-up the patient was asymptomatic without any neurological complication and with carotid patency."
