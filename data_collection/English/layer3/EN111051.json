  "text": "A 24-year-old young male patient with a history of complicated total arch replacement using elephant trunk technique for acute DeBakey type-1 aortic dissection 6â€‰months before visited our hospital with the chief complaint of persistent fever. Antibiotic treatment in local hospital was ineffective. Echocardiography showed liquid dark area around the aortic graft, and a computerized tomography angiography (CTA) was done for further evaluation of periaortic fluid collection which showed findings to suggest perigraft abscess. The patient underwent surgical debridement of the abscess and was found to have an abscess around the aortic graft which was drained followed by antibiotic treatment. The patient was discharged to his local hospital and recovered well at 2 month follow-up appointment."
