  "text": "We describe a case of a patient with cutaneous melanoma, with postoperatively established Breslow's tumor thickness of 6 mm, operated on the AJCC model within two surgical sessions. The usual primary excision was performed with a surgical safety margin of 0.5 cm in all directions, followed by a secondary excision with an additional surgical security field of 1.2 cm in all directions (due to the patient's wish for the optimal cosmetic result, agreed and approved by the dermatosurgeon performing the manipulation)."
