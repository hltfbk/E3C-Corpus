  "text": "A 61-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital with a mass in his median upper lip of four years' duration. An examination of his median upper lip revealed a well-defined tumor measuring 9 Ã— 12 mm in diameter, which was subsequently resected. Three years after the first surgery, the tumor recurred and was resected. Both tumors were confirmed by histopathology to be sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia. Neither recurrence nor metastasis was observed in three and a half years of follow-up after the second surgery."
