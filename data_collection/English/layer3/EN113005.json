  "text": "A 60-year-old man was referred to our hospital for kidney transplantation. The proposed transplant was ABO incompatible, from a donor with blood-type A to a recipient with blood-type O. The recipient's anti-A blood-type IgG antibody titer was measured at 4096-fold dilution. Following desensitization therapy, including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 750 mg/day for 3 months, intravenous Rituximab 200 mg, and two sessions of double filtration plasmapheresis, the anti-A blood-type IgG antibody titer decreased to only 516-fold dilution and did not meet our target of less than 128-fold dilution. MMF was thus continued for an additional 4 months and four additional sessions of plasmapheresis were undertaken. Following these interventions, antibody titers decreased to 128-fold dilution and ABO-iLKT was performed. Following transplant, antibody-mediated rejection was not observed and renal function was preserved. However, a post-operative renal biopsy 1.5 months later showed evidence of T-cell-mediated rejection IB. The patient was treated with steroids, with no increase in serum creatinine."
