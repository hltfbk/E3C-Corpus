  "text": "Four patients were referred to an endocrinology clinic for the evaluation of multiple atraumatic fractures, muscle weakness, generalized muscle and joint pain. Laboratory evaluation was notable for persistent hypophosphatemia due to urinary phosphate wasting, low to low-normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, elevated alkaline phosphatase and elevated fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Tumor localization was successful, and all four patients underwent resection of phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors. Post-operatively, patients exhibited normalization of serum phosphorus, in addition to significant improvement in their ambulatory function."
