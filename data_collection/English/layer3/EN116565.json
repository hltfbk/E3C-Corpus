  "text": "A 53-year-old Caucasian male presented with epigastric pain for three days and electrocardiographic evidence for an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery. Reperfusion was achieved by balloon angioplasty followed by placement of a bare metal stent. On hospital day six, the patient developed acute respiratory distress, a new loud pansystolic murmur, and hemodynamic instability. Echocardiography revealed the presence of a large defect in the inferobasal interventricular septum with significant left-to-right shunt consistent with ventricular septal rupture. The patient underwent emergent surgical repair with a bovine pericardial patch."
