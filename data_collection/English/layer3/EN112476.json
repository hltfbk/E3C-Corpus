  "text": "We report a challenging case of malignant pulmonary PEComa combined with a primary adenocarcinoma in a 54-year-old man. The PEComa-like tumor showed strong Melan-A and weak transcription factor E3 (TFE3) protein expression but no TFE3 gene rearrangement. The carcinoma-like nodule was recognized as a poorly differentiated primary lung adenocarcinoma."
