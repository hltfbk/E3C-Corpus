  "text": "We report a case of 33-year-old male patient who presented with recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation and numbness of bilateral lower limb extremities. These nonspecific neurovisceral attacks were subject to medical and surgical misdiagnoses of acute appendicitis, sinus tachycardia, renal calculi, drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis and two episodes of partial intestinal obstruction. The sixth acute attack raised the suspicion of an acute porphyria. Watson and Schwartz test was positive for porphobilinogen in urine. Mutation analysis by DNA sequencing of the extracted DNA of the proband revealed a previously reported missense mutation, c.517C>T encoding p.R173W in the HMBS gene, confirming the diagnosis of Acute Intermittent Porphyria. Four out of five family members who underwent targeted mutation analyses were mutation-positive."
