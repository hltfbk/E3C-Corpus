  "text": "This is a report of three girls aged 6-11 years with DAH and PC. Two patients had decreased hemoglobin and one had increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. High-resolution computed tomography showed bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrate, and diagnosis of PC was confirmed by lung biopsy. Immunofluorescence test in one case showed granular IgG and a small amount of granular IgA deposit on the alveolar walls, and was negative in the other two cases, describing isolated pauci-immune PC. Treatment was with glucocorticoid alone or combination with immunosuppressants, and the symptoms resolved in all patients."
