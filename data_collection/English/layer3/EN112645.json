  "text": "We report a 61-year-old Caucasian male patient who initially presented with unexplained leukocytosis. An outpatient work-up was planned to rule out a myeloproliferative disorder but the patient was acutely admitted for MRSA septic shock. The patient was stabilized prior bone marrow work-up and was then diagnosed with an atypical type of CNL (JAK2 positive, CSF3R negative). The patient refused further treatment due to social circumstances and requested palliative care instead."
