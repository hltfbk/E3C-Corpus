  "text": "A 19-year-old woman of Asian origin was referred to our neurology out-patient department for the management of refractory seizures. She reported several episodes of a loss of consciousness with tonic posturing when she assumed an upright position, which was accompanied by constitutional symptoms. A clinical examination showed orthostatic hypotension and an investigation confirmed the diagnosis of Takayasu's disease with presentation as convulsive syncope."
