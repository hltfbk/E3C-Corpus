  "text": "We report here a case of an evolution of metastatic breast cancer with lymphangitic carcinomatosis after taxane based chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. This 37-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with complaints of dyspnea and dry cough. There was clinical concern for visceral crisis and a chemotherapy with eribulin was initiated. Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis disappeared and the patient achieved a good partial response."
