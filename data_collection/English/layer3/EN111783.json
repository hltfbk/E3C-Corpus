  "text": "The aim of this paper is to present the case of a 26-year-old female patient, registered at the Clinic of Periodontology with highly expressed gingivitis, unsatisfactory periodontal status, presence of diastemas between the frontal teeth and attachment loss of 5-6 millimetres in different areas. We conducted a thorough classic periodontal treatment, as well as training for proper maintenance of oral hygiene, with frequent professional oral-prophylactic sessions, complemented with orthodontic treatment. Fixed orthodontic appliances were installed, and mild forces were applied for gradual levelling of the teeth, with constant control of the periodontal status. After 20 months of treatment, the patient was in retention."
