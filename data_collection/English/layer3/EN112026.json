  "text": "Herein, we describe a case of primary cutaneous actinomycosis, erroneously treated as cutaneous tuberculosis, in a patient living with AIDS. On clinical examination, the characteristic lesion, resembling cutaneous tuberculosis, observed on the dorsum of a left leg. No other lesion elsewhere on the body was observed, however. Cytological examinations of the stabbed biopsy were negative for malignant cells; although hyper-keratosis and mild-acanthosis of epidermis, acute inflammatory infiltrates comprising plasma cell, macrophages and neutrophils were observed in the upper and mid dermis. The pus aspirated from lesion grew a molar tooth, adherent colonies in microaerophilic condition. Further, identifications and susceptibility pattern against recommended antibiotics were assessed as per the CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute) guidelines. Subsequently, the case was then, diagnosed as primary cutaneous actinomycosis. Radiographic imaging of abdomen and lungs were normal; no feature of disseminated actinomycosis seen. Penicillin G followed by Penicillin V, was prescribed for 12Â months. The patient underwent progressive changes and no relapse noted on periodic follow-up."
