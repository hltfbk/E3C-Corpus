  "text": "The first case is a 41-year-old feoderm man who presented to the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Hospital das Clínicas in May 2015, with irregular fever history (38-39 °C), dyspnea, weight loss (8 kg/1 year), and asthenia with increased cervical lymph nodes of 1-year duration. His immunohistochemical diagnosis presented Castleman's disease in plasmacytic/diffuse form. In the second case, a 35-year-old feoderm man presented at the same hospital with multiple cervical enlarged lymph nodes and histopathological evidence of Castleman's disease associated with human herpesvirus-8."
