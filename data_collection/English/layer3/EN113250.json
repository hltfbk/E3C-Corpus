  "text": "Unilateral STN-DBS induced uncontrollable laughter with activation of the most ventral contacts in both patients. However, the location of the electrodes responsible for this adverse effect differed between the patients. In the first patient, the DBS lead was placed more inferiorly and medially within the STN. In the second patient, the DBS lead was implanted more anteriorly and inferiorly than initially planned at the level of the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr)."
