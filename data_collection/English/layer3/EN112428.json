  "text": "Case 1 was a 38-year-old man who had a history of bilateral mild panuveitis who was diagnosed with CAEBV. Fifteen months later, a severe bilateral granulomatous panuveitis developed. White infiltrates covered the optic disc and all the retinal vessels of the right eye, and white nodules were seen along the retinal veins and arteries of the left eye. Case 2 was a 34-year-old man with bilateral panuveitis showing mutton-fat keratic precipitates and diffuse vitreous opacity in both eyes. A snow ball-like vitreous opacity was present in the right eye. Systemic investigations revealed the presence of CAEBV. In both cases, a comprehensive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of the aqueous humor detected significant copy numbers of EBV-DNA. The intraocular inflammation did not respond to steroid, methotrexate, and other immunosuppressive therapies, but was ameliorated after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with preceding chemotherapy and low-dose total body irradiation in both cases."
