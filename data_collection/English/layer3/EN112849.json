  "text": "A 58-year-old male patient is presented with two melanocytic lesions located in the right clavicle (subclavicular area) and left the scapular area that meets clinically and dermatoscopically the requirements for malignant melanoma. The lesions were removed by a radical excision with 0.5 cm surgical safety margin in all directions. During the subsequent histological verification it was established it was melanoma with a tumour thickness of 1 mm that in one case, and the other 2 mm. A week later, according to the recommendations of the current guidelines, a re-excision was performed with a surgical safety margin of 1.5 cm in all directions. Considering the complications that are possible during the parallel removal of a draining lymph node recommended for these tumour thicknesses, the patient definitively refused its detection and removal."
