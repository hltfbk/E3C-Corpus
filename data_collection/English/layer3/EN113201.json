  "text": "A 34-year-old gravida II para l woman presented to Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital with the diagnosis of semilobar holoprosencephaly and early onset preeclampsia with severity features. The gestational age at admission was 26 + 3 weeks. She is Amhara by ethnicity.Â The pregnancy was from a non-consanguineous marriage. She presented with the complaints of severe and persistent headache associated with blurring of vision and generalized body swelling. After she was stabilized, she and her husband were counselled and termination was decided. She gave birth after three doses of 100 microgram misoprostol given vaginally every 3 hours. The outcome was 1.1 kg male neonate; there were associated dysmorphic features of holoprosencephaly such as cebocephaly, micropenis, and postaxial polydactyl with agenesis of middle phalanges of the fifth finger. Only basic care was given and the neonate died after 20 minutes' stay in our neonatal intensive care unit. The mother was counselled to have preconception and antenatal screening in her next pregnancy. She left the hospital relatively well."
