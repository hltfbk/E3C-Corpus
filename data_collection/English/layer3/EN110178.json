  "text": "CASE 1 A80 years old postmenopausal moroccan woman (para6, gravida6) admitted to our hospital with postmenopausal bleeding and hydrorrhea. Gynealogical examination showed a cervical stenotic with the presence of a tumor processus whose size is diffuclt to assess. On bimanual recto-vaginal examination we showed that the tumor had invaded both sides of the parametrium. Biopsy of cervical growth was done and sent for histopathological examination. CASE 2 80-year-old woman presented to Department of gynaecology with vaginal bleeding with pelvic pain. Physical examination revealed a friable mass in the cervix. Bimanual pelvic examination showed that vagina, uterus and bilateral adnexal structures are normal. Speculum examination showed an ulcerative and exophytic mass, 4cm in diameter on the anterior lip of the cervix. The lymph nodes are free. Transabdominal pelvic ultrasound reported that the uterus was with homogenous myometrium, indistinct endometrial echo pattern and bilateral adnexal areas were normal. Incisional biopsy was performed. Microscopic examination showed fragmented biopsy with tumor cells disposed in cribriform nests and cords. The tumor cells were small, uniform, composed of dense basophilic nuclei with inconspious nucleoli. Mitotic figures were rarely found. Immunohistochemical study was performed. Tumor cells express receptors ant-CD117, hormone receptors and focally anti-CK5/6, anti-S-100 protein and anti-CD56. A diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma was made."
