  "text": "We recruited a family with two affected individuals. The proband (Patient 1), a 25-year-old male, was presented with slow progressive symptoms, including spastic gait disturbance and vision loss since the 5th year of life. His elder sister (Patient 2), became wheelchair-bound and demented at the age of 22 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed increased signal intensity in the white matter along with the involvement of the bilateral corticospinal tracts. GALC deficiency was confirmed by biochemical analysis. DNA sequencing revealed two mutations (c.865G > C: p. G289R and c.136G > T: p. D46Y) in GALC. The clinical characteristics, brain MRI, biochemical and molecular findings led to the diagnosis of Krabbe disease."
