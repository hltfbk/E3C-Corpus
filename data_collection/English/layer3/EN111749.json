  "text": "We report a case of a 34-year-old Mediterranean woman diagnosed with post-thyroidectomy hypothyroidism. She was commenced on levothyroxine and developed liver injury confirmed by noninvasive liver investigations. Complete recovery of the patient's liver tests occurred upon cessation of the drug. Triiodothyronine was an appropriate treatment alternative."
