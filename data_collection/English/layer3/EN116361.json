  "text": "The present report describes a case of a middle-aged married couple who lived in the same house and who simultaneously suffered from summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis. This report analyzes these two cases in terms of environmental research and its microbiological, radiological, and pathological aspects. This case report is followed by a review of family occurrences of summer-type hypersensitivity pneumonitis from 22 studies with a total of 49 patients (including the two present cases) in Japan."
