  "text": "A 52-year-old man had a disturbance in swallowing because of cerebral infarction. We attempted PEG under gastrointestinal fiberscope (GIF) and colon Ô¨Åberscope inspection; however, the procedure was unsuccessful because it was impossible to move the transverse colon downward. We therefore attempted LAPEG to observe the stomach and other organs. Under laparoscopic observation, we diagnosed gastric volvulus, classified as the organo-axial type. For this reason, inserting the tube through the skin was very difficult. We easily corrected the gastric volvulus by using laparoscopic forceps and were finally able to place the PEG tube safely."
