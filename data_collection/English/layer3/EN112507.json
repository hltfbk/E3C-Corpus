  "text": "An 85-year-old male complained of difficulty swallowing, and examination revealed gastric cancer with multiple liver metastases. Although he received concomitant chemotherapy, a residual tumor was observed in the primary lesion while the metastatic lesions disappeared completely. Conversion surgery was considered optional treatment; however, he could not undergo that because of advanced age and comorbidities. Thus, we performed ESD to treat the residual tumor. As a result, we resected the residual lesion completely. The patient has been alive for 29 mo since ESD, without recurrence."
