  "text": "We present a case of a 26-year-old male patient that was diagnosed with paraganglioma of the right-frontal lobe infiltrating the falx and frontal bone which was diagnosed after suffering from a headache and abnormal vision. On initial work-up he was found to have right pulmonary nodules that increased in size after follow up and other nodules appeared in the contralateral lung. He underwent subtotal resection of the brain tumor and complete resection of the bilateral pulmonary nodules."
