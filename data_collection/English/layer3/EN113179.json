  "text": "A 46-year-old female with a past medical history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, presented with meningismus 36 h after first infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed neutrophilic pleocytosis and hyperproteinorrachia. All microbiological tests were negative. The patient recovered remarkably fast without sequela after just five days of antibiotic therapy."
