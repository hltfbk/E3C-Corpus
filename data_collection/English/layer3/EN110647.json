  "text": "A 36-year-old man complained of abdominal pain for 13 d. Blood analysis showed anemia. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography revealed a tumor in the horizontal part of the duodenum as the main finding, leading to duodeno-duodenal intussusception. No obvious abnormalities were found on endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal radiography. He was diagnosed with duodenal intussusception secondary to duodenal adenoma. Laparotomy showed duodeno-duodenal intussusception and a tumor in the horizontal part of the duodenum near the ascending part. Postoperative pathology revealed tubular-villous adenoma with low-grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (local high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia). He was discharged without complications."
