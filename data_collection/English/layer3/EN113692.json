  "text": "A 53-year-old female presented to her General Practitioner (GP) with heavy menstrual bleeding and was diagnosed with multiple fibroids. Folowing a hysterectomy and removal of both tubes and ovaries for these symptomatic uterine fibroids, an incidental diagnosis of low grade leiomyosarcoma was made. A CT scan found no evidence of residual or metastatic disease and no further treatment was deemed necessary. 6 months later she presented to A & E with a numb lower lip but it took another 6 months for the diagnosis of metastatic LMS to the mandible to be made."
