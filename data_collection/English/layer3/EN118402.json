  "text": "We present a case of a 47-year-old caucasian woman who was known to have transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder who presented with features of peritonitis. An exploratory laparotomy revealed free perforation of the urinary bladder. The perforation was closed. However, on the second post-operative day she started draining urine from the abdominal drain and was taken back to the operating theatre. The stitches in the urinary bladder had given off and she underwent radical cystectomy along with double barrel cutaneous ureterostomies. Peritoneal biopsies revealed disseminated transitional cell carcinoma in the peritoneum. She made a slow postoperative recovery."
