  "text": "Here we reported a NSCLC patient with EGFR sensitive mutation of deletion within EGFR exon 19, who had been resistant to icotinib and AZD9291 successively after a period of 18 months response duration. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique using plasma sample suggested an acquired EGFR Leu792H mutation, rather than C797S one. Interestingly, the patient obtained another 8 months of disease-free duration with symptoms greatly relieved after repeating icotinib administration. The overall survival of the patient has been thirty-six months and still in the extension."
