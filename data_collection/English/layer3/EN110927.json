  "text": "We are reporting a case of GCT of the 3rdMC in a 19-year-old female. She presented to us with a painful, firm, ovoid, and gradually progressive swelling measuring 4 cm Ã— 3 cm over the dorsum of the left (non-dominant)hand, since past 6 months. Fine-needle aspiration cytology was suggestive of GCT of the tendon sheath. Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan revealed the extent of the lesion with no neurovascular involvement. Although various reconstructive procedures to salvage the affected Ray have been reported in literature, we planned for a surgical resection of the lesion leaving behind 1 cm of healthy MC base which appeared to be normal radiologically and intraoperatively. Reconstruction of the defect was done using non-vascularized contoured fibular strut graft, fixed with 2.5 mm mini reconstruction plate, along with reconstruction of the collateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joint. The histopathological study confirmed the diagnosis of GCT."
