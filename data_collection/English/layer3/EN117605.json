  "text": "Four randomly-selected, Caucasian patients (a 45-year-old woman, a 26-year-old man, a 51-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman) were treated with aminaphtone for approximately one year. For all patients, the brown patches - a sign of stasis purpura - disappeared without the appearance of new lesions within this period."
