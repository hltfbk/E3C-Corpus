  "text": "An 11-year-old male was referred with developmental delay, intellectual disability and microcephaly. Physical examination revealed additionally short stature and multiple facial dysmorphisms. Banding cytogenetic studies revealed a karyotype of mos 46,XY,r(6)(p25.3q27)[54]/45,XY,-6[13]/46,XY,r(6)(::p25.3→q27::p25.3→q27::)[13]/46,XY[6]/47,XY,r(6)(p25.3q27)×2[2]dn. Additionally, molecular karyotyping and molecular cytogenetics confirmed the breakpoints and characterized a 1.3 Mb contiguous duplication at 6p25.3."
