  "text": "A 65Â year old, previously healthy Sinhalese man had fallen from a coconut tree and was found unconscious with wounds on his limbs on the right side of his body. He was taken to the closest hospital. After being given primary care, he was transferred to the Kandy teaching hospital for neurosurgical management. Physical examination findings suggested a stroke but not the medical history. We could not exclude a head and cervical spine injury clinically. A computed tomography scan of the brain and cervical spine showed a left thalamic hemorrhage but no other injuries that could be attributed to trauma, therefore we confirmed it was a hemorrhagic stroke presenting as a traumatic brain injury."
