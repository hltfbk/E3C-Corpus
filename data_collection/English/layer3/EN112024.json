  "text": "Our case, a 19 year-old young man who is the first adult-onset PFAPA patient in Iran and was accompanied by splenomegaly. Since March 2017, the patient suffered from periodic febrile attacks (39-40 °C). During these fever attacks, the patient had many aphthous ulcers in his mouth, swollen glands in his neck and sore in the back of the throat. The patient was admitted to a hospital in Tehran during a severe fever attack due to weakness, lethargy, high-temperature and slight abdominal pain in the left upper quadrant (LUQ) area. Abdominal sonography was done and spleen size was larger than normal and was determined to be 32×140 mm (splenomegaly). All data were collected from a reliable governmental laboratory in Tehran."
