  "text": "We report a case of a 29 years old male with a 9 year history of laparoscopic Roux en y gastric bypass (LRGYB), presenting with recurrent abdominal pain for 2 months radiating to the right shoulder. Ultrasound examination revealed gallstones and the patient was subsequently admitted for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively, whitish colored fluid, high in triglycerides content was aspirated. During exploration, an internal hernia limb defect was found and corrected."
