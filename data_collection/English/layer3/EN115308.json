  "text": "This is the case report of a 58 years old Caucasian male patient who had received right sided extended hemihepatectomy with partial resection of the portal vein due to hilar cholangiocarcinoma three years ago. The patient suffered from portal hypertension with difficult controllable bleeding of esophageal varices due to chronically progressive thrombosis of the portal vein caused by chronic anastomosis stenosis of the reconstructed left portal vein branch (confirmed in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination 6 months after the portal vein reconstruction). A transsplenic access (6 French) was chosen to allow recanalization of the portal vein, stent-angioplasty of the anastomosis and coiling of the gastric varices. The transsplenic tract was successfully embolized with an Amplatzer® Vascular Plug 4 and gelfoam pledgets."
