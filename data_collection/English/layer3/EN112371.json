  "text": "Here we describe an 85-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with right flank pain 10 years ago. We describe a case of papillary thyroid carcinoma presenting as a primary renal tumor with extensive pulmonary and bone metastases. Abdominal screening with computed tomography revealed a mass on her right kidney, which was considered a primary renal cell carcinoma and she underwent a right nephrectomy. Unexpectedly, papillary thyroid carcinoma metastasis was diagnosed from demonstrative histopathological findings, such as positive immunoperoxidase staining for thyroglobulin. A total thyroidectomy was performed. Unenhanced thoracic computed tomography and skeletal scintigraphy revealed bilateral multiple nodules in her lungs and bone metastasis on T10 vertebra and right sacroiliac joint. Initially, 30 Gy radiotherapy was implemented to her T9-10 vertebrae and then she was treated with a total of 800 mCi radioactive iodine for ablation. A radioactive iodine whole body scan was performed after each 200 mCi and continuous progression was shown in each scan. After she was lost to follow-up for 3 years, she referred to our clinic again with a draining mass on her neck and we planned radiotherapy to this giant mass."
