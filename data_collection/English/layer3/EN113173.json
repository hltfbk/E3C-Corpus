  "text": "A case report of a 40-year-old male with complex partial temporal lobe epilepsy. He has coincident attacks of fall and pallor. The patient underwent simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) and video electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. The slow activity in EEG coincide with the appearance of bradycardia in ECG then cardiac asystole which clinically correspond to the patient syncope. After insertion of a cardiac pacemaker, only complex partial attacks develop with a marked reduction in frequency and no more fall attacks."
