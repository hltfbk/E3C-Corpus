  "text": "A previously healthy female patient presented with an attempted suicide with overdoses sertraline (2250 mg), diazepam (200 mg), and temazepam (400 mg). Routine laboratory studies were normal and her ECG upon admission showed a normal QT interval. The next day, her ECG showed prolongation of the QTc interval up to 525 ms. After discontinuation of sertraline the QT interval normalized. Echocardiography and exercise electrocardiography were normal. After hospitalization, the patient resumed sertraline in the normally recommended dose and QT interval remained within normal ranges."
