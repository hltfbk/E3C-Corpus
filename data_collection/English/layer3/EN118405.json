  "text": "We report a case of a 54-year-old male with a history of untreated actinic keratosis and lung cancer. He developed a rash on the sun exposed areas of skin after he received carboplatin and docetaxel. Topical high-potency corticosteroid administration resulted in diminished rash despite the ongoing chemotherapy regimen."
