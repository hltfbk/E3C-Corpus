  "text": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common form of acute leukemia in children [1]. It usually results in signs of bone marrow failure or tumor syndrome [2]. Hypercalcemia is a rare metabolic complication of pediatric ALL [1]. Here we report a case of ALL with severe hypercalcemia, disseminated osteolytic lesion, and absence of circulating blasts.\nCase report\nA 3 years old boy was admitted to our department because of prolonged fever, nausea, vomiting and increasing pain in both lower limbs. On physical examination, he appeared pale, apathetic, with infracentimetric cervical lymphadenopathy and no cardiovascular symptoms. His lower limbs appeared painful without any signs of inflammation.\nInitial laboratory investigations revealed white blood cells count of 6400/ml (with neutrophil 3500/ml, lymphocytes 2400/ml), haemoglobin level of 5.9 gr/dl and platelets count of 164,000/ml. Peripheral blood smear showed no blasts or abnormal cells. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was high (33 mm), the C-reactive protein level was high (65 mg/ml).\nSerum calcium was 4.65 mmol / l, with normal serum creatinine, liver function tests phosphorus, albumin 27.8g/l and serum LDH. Serum parathormone was low (2.08 ug/ml). Unfortunately we didn't have 25(OH)-vitamin D, calcitonin and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) levels. The thyroid function were high for throid-stimulating hormone (13 mIU/l) and normal for FT4 (14mg/ml). Urine calcium to creatinine ratio was 4.32 and urine phosphorus was 2.08 mmol/l.\nAbdominal ultrasound was normal. Skeletal radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scan of the skull, thorax and abdomen revealed osteolytic lesions in the skull, pelvis and long bones Figure 1.\nDespite the absence of circulating blasts, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy studies led to the diagnosis of B-cell precursor ALL (Diffuse CD10 positive, focal CD20 positive, CD79a negative, CD34 negative and TdT negative) Figure 2. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology was negative for malignant cells. Cytogenetics by conventional karyotyping showed a deletion of 12p [del \\(12) (p13) [7]/46,XY [13]].\nThe hypercalcemia was initially treated with intravenous isotonic saline and diuretics, but the serum calcium level normalized only after the beginning of specific chemotherapy according to the EORTC protocol. The patient was in remission for one year and had a good clinical condition and finally relapsed and died of septic shock."
