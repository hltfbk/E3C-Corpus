  "text": "The patient in this case was a 48-year-old woman with a polypoid mass protruding into the endocervical canal. The patient underwent a total hysterectomy outside the institution. During biopsy, the mass showed a cerebroid aspect. Histological study revealed a tumor with a predominantly tubular and ductal growth pattern. The immunoprofile showed negative staining for calretinin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEAm), estrogen receptors (ER), and progesterone receptors (PR), and positive staining for CD10, p16, and PAX2. The Ki-67 score was 46%. Using a next-generation sequencing assay, we documented genomic alterations in KRAS and CTNNB1, low tumor mutation burden (TMB), and an absence of microsatellite instability. In addition, gain of the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q) was also documented using chomogenic in situ hybridization (CISH). Three years later, the patient presented pulmonary nodules in the lingula and left basal lobe that were resected by thoracotomy. The histopathologic study of the pulmonary nodules confirmed the presence of metastases."
