  "text": "We present the case of a 27-year-old male patient with neck mass and nephrotic syndrome. The presence of both eosinophilia and elevated immunoglobulin E levels were concerning for Kimura's disease, which is an allergic syndrome defined by eosinophilic granulomas of neck soft tissue along with peripheral eosinophilia. The eventual final diagnosis, however, was sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma of parotid gland with both eosinophilia and membranous nephropathy. Following the surgical resection of the mass, the nephrotic syndrome completely resolved."
