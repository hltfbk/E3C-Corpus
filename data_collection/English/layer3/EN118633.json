  "text": "We report the case of a 49 year old white woman with invasive ductal carcinoma with lobular differentiation who developed submucosal oropharyngeal metastases nearly two years after her original diagnosis after presenting with odynophagia and dysphagia. The patient's symptoms preceded any associated radiological or endoscopic abnormalities by at least 9 months. Repeat computed tomography scan and eventual oropharyngeal biopsy confirmed submucosal metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma, suggesting occult submucosal spread."
