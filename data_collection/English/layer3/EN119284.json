  "text": "A 67 years old man was admitted with a 24 hour history of pain in right iliac fossa. A pre-operative diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made but at operation a 2.5 cm inflamed and gangrenous solitary diverticulum of caecum was found. This was treated by right hemicolectomy as there was the suspicion of underlying malignancy."
