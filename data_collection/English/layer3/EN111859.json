  "text": "Here, we present a case of pancreatic lipoma in a 59-year-old female. She was asymptomatic and had no medical history of note. CT and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass like well-differentiated liposarcoma in the pancreatic head, positron emission tomography/CT showed a low fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and laboratory tests revealed elevated transaminase and carbohydrate antigen-199 levels. Finally, the patient underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Histologically, mature adipocytes were noted in the bulk of the tumor. Accordingly, the pathologic diagnosis of the pancreatic neoplasm was lipoma. To our knowledge, this case is the first example of a suspected well-differentiated liposarcoma that was actually a pancreatic lipoma. We also highlight the radiological features distinguishing a pancreatic lipoma from a pancreatic liposarcoma and briefly review the literature."
