  "text": "We report a 40-year-old female who presented with chronic headache over a decade associated with recurrent neurological abnormalities including optic neuritis, hemisensory loss, migraine, facial nerve palsy, and recurrent vertigo. Although there was an initial perceived response to steroids, the patient had a subsequent progressive course. On investigations, she was found to have a diffused dural thickening on contrast MRI with a strongly positive Mantoux test with caseating necrotizing granulomatous inflammation on dural histology. With initiation of antituberculous medication with steroids, the patient markedly improved, and the medication for tuberculosis was continued for a year with good response."
