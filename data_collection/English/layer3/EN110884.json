  "text": "We describe a case of a prematurely born female infant presenting with antenatal polyhydramnios, and postnatal dehydration and hyponatremia. After 7 weeks of sodium supplementation, the patient demonstrated complete resolution of her hyponatremia and developed only transient metabolic alkalosis at 2 months of age but continues to be polyuric and exhibits hypercalciuria, without development of nephrocalcinosis. She was found to have two pathogenic variants in the KCNJ1 gene: a frameshift deletion, p.Glu334Glyfs*35 and a missense variant, p. Pro110Leu. While many features of classic ROMK mutations have resolved, the child does have Bartter syndrome type II and needs prolonged pediatric nephrology follow-up."
