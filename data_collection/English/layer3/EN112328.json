  "text": "A 43-year-old male with advanced gastric cancer was treated with nivolumab as a third-line chemotherapy. He had no history of allergies. Eight days after the first administration of nivolumab, fever, tachycardia, appetite loss and increases in liver and biliary enzymes were observed. Computed tomography revealed neither bile duct obstruction nor progression of liver metastases but showed that there was edema of the Gleason sheath. Histopathological analysis of the liver revealed cholestatic liver injury with CD8+ T lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration. Neither viral infection nor autoimmune disease was revealed. His symptoms were similar to those of CRS observed after T cell therapy. We diagnosed his disease as nivolumab-induced liver injury and cholangitis accompanied by CRS based on his serum cytokine levels."
