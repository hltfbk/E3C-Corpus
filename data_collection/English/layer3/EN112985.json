  "text": "We present a rare case of a 4-year-old child with complete rectal prolapse of 12 cm in length. The prolapsed rectum was manually repositioned after reducing the oedema. The precipitating factor was identified as excessive straining while passing stools. A change in position while passing stools was advised along with a high fibre diet and a stool softener. Recurrence was not observed in the 3 month of follow-up."
