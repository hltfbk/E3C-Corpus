  "text": "A 66-year-old female patient undergoing metronidazole treatment for pleural empyema was admitted to our institution after her second episode of seizure. Over the course of 1 week after admittance, the patient developed several convulsive seizures along with progressive cerebellar dysfunction and cognitive impairment. MRI revealed bilateral, symmetrical hyperintense signal changes in the pons and dentate nuclei. EEG, ECG, lumbar puncture, and blood samples were normal. The patient improved already 2-3 days after discontinuation of metronidazole and was discharged fully recovered after 17 days. Follow-up clinical assessment and MRI were unremarkable."
