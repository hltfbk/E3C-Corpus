  "text": "A 56-year-old Asian woman presented with respiratory distress and episodes of apnea at night. A solitary mass from the left arytenoids was found to be nearly obstructing the airway and causing the sleep apnea. There was also a parapharynx mass protruding into the pharynx. The parapharynx tumor was removed with the lateral incision approach, and the arytenoid tumor was removed with a transoral carbon dioxide laser. The pathologic diagnosis was plexiform neurofibroma for the arytenoid mass and neurofibroma for the parapharynx mass."
