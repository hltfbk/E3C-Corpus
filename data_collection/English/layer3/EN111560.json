  "text": "A 53-year-old previously healthy Sri Lankan female presented with high-grade fever, painful oral ulcers, odynophagia and multiple bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies for 1 month. She also had a loss of appetite and weight. She had oral ulcers and bilateral blepharitis. Dermatological examination revealed multiple tender papules with a mamillated appearance and targetoid lesions with a yellowish centre over the face, upper trunk and upper limbs. She also had multiple tender subcutaneous nodules over the extensor aspect of upper limbs. Her inflammatory markers were significantly elevated. Aspirate from a submental lymph node abscess revealed the growth of Burkholderia pseudomallei. Melioidosis antibody titer was > 10,240. The histology of the skin lesions of the face and left forearm showed a prominent neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis and the morphological features were in favour of Sweet syndrome with panniculitis. She was started on intravenous meropenem 2 g daily and showed rapid clinical improvement with the disappearance of skin lesions as well as a reduction in inflammatory markers."
