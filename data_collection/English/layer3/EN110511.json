  "text": "A 75 year old man who presented with a 15 year history of asymmetrical abdominal enlargement with the right half more greatly enlarged. It started insidiously as a part of generalized weight gain before persisting as a truncal weight excess. There was no symptom of intra-abdominal pathology. He experienced a lot of difficulty with lying prone or supine. He subsequently could not drive his car or walk without a walking stick due to bilateral knee pains and feeling of dragging weight tilt on the right side of the trunk. There was occasional waist pain. He had a positive history of alcohol consumption (an average of 4 bottles of beer per day for 40 years) but stopped drinking 6 years after onset of his symptoms. He also stopped attending social gatherings. He had associated lipoma on the right thigh. He is a known diabetic with hypertensive heart disease on medications. His concerns were both cosmetic and functional. Although the burden was enormous, he was unaware of the availability of aesthetic surgery in our setting till he opened up to a radiologist (during a routine investigation) who refereed him to the plastic surgery clinic. Examination showed an obese looking elderly man in no obvious distress but with a moody affect. His weight was 123 kg and the height was 1.8 metres with a BMI of 38 kg/m 2. His waist circumference was 145 cm compared to the normal for males which is 102 cm. Abdominal girth was 141 cm at the umbilicus and 151 cm at the point of maximal enlargement which is 20 cm below the umbilicus. Musculo-skeletal examination showed bilateral knee tenderness without swelling or crepitus. He also had bilateral gynecomastia and lipoma of the right proximal thigh. A diagnosis of truncal obesity in an elderly man with bilateral gynecomastia, early bilateral knee osteoarthritis, hypertension and diabetes was made and patient was worked up for surgery. The ultrasound of the abdominal wall showed variable thickness with the upper quadrants measuring between 7 and 10 cm while the lower quadrants showed a thickness of about 14 cm on the left and 20 cm on the right. The intra-abdominal fat was also sonologically significant. No organ pathology was demonstrated. Laboratory investigations including serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine, fasting blood sugar, complete blood count, serum protein, serum lipids, liver function test and echocardiography, were done and were all within normal ranges. Patient was reviewed by both the cardiologist and the anesthesiologist and certified fit independently. He was counseled and informed consent obtained for abdominoplasty plus or minus liposuction. Liposuction was later excluded to shorten anaesthesia time and reduce the risk of complications because of his age and co-morbidities. General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation was used after epidural anesthesia failed. About 1.7 litres of Hunstad fluid was also infiltrated essentially for hemostasis and hydro-dissection. Traditional incision for conventional abdominoplasty was used and the protuberant infra-umblical tissue was excised weighing about 8.4 kg. The rectus sheath was plicated in two rows, the umbilicus transposed and the wound closed over two redivac drains, the left in the lower flank and the right in the upper flank. The estimated blood loss was 750 ml and he was transfused two pints of sedimented cells intra-operatively. Post-operative complications included blood transfusion reaction, surgical site infection with partial wound dehiscence. There was periumblical sinus discharging lipoid exudates. All the observed post operative events resolved on wound dressings with povidone iodine and antibiotics. The patient had an amazing improvement in the quality of life and eventual return to his business and social life style. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6 are different views of images of the patient that shows his pre and post operative looks. He currently walks without a walking stick, drives his car and could use plain trousers and dress corporate, which were previously impossible. He was advised to continue with alcoholic abstinence and dietary control. A year post abdominoplasty, he weighed 116 kg with a BMI of 35.8 kg/m 2, his waist girth and the abdominal girth at the umblical level were 112 cm and 123 cm respectively. The point of maximal enlargement with a circumference of 125 cm located 10 cm below the umbilicus post-operatively compared to a circumference of 151 cm located at 20 cm below the umbilicus pre-operatively. The post operative ultrasound of the abdominal wall showed variable thickness in a range of 1.3 - 4.4 cm."
