  "text": "Case 1 A 4 years old male, admitted for fever and abdominal pains associated with a generalized tonic clonic seizure lasting approximately 5 minutes, with no ocular revulsion nor sphincteric relaxation nor postictal state. The past medical history was unremarkable and the physical examination revealed a temperature of 39.5°C. The absence of inflammatory signs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and a positive thick blood smear (120 trophozoites/µl) led to the diagnosis of severe malaria (convulsion being the criterion of severity). Other blood tests such as full blood count reported 8,000 leukocytes/mm 3 (normal) with 75% granulocytes, 164,000 platelets/mm 3, a moderate normochromic normocytic anaemia with a haemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dl. He received parenteral antimalarial treatment (artesunate) with oral relay (artemisinin combination therapy) for 3 days supplemented with an antipyretic.\nAfter 48 hours, the patient remained febrile and three blood cultures were done. Septicaemia dose ceftriaxone was prescribed for 72 hours, yet the fever persisted. Second-line antibiotic therapy with imipenem and amikacin was given for 72 hours with persistent fever. After 06 days, all blood cultures done were sterile. No infectious site was clearly identified and other causes of persistent fever in children, including other inflammatory diseases and haematological malignancies were investigated. Biologic workups showed: a CRP level at 48.11 mg/l, transaminases at 130.40 IU/l (normal < 50) for glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase\n(GOT) and 40.32 IU/l (normal < 35) for glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), ferritinaemia at 1200.46µg/l (normal: 15-100), elevated LDH at 1576 IU/L (normal 200-500 IU/L) and elevated triglycerides. Rheumatoid and antinuclear factors, anti cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), blood smear and viral serologies were unremarkable.\nThe diagnosis of Still disease was made. The patient received one-month dose regressive corticosteroid therapy, combined with methotrexate from the second week. The fever completely regressed twelve hours after the start of corticosteroid therapy, and the patient's clinical state improved considerably. Case 2 A 10 years old boy was admitted for a 10 days duration persistent fever and asthenia. He described an odynophagia from two days prior to the onset of fever. His past medical history was unremarkable. The physical examination revealed an altered general state, a temperature of 39°C, no sign of meningeal irritation and no clinically evident portal of entry. He had a class II splenomegaly, with micro polyadenopathies located at the inguinal region and adjoin the upper right cervical chain, with good oral hygiene. A walking lameness occurred on the 8 th day with painful mobilization of the right hip. He had received a well-conducted outpatient anti-malaria treatment and probabilistic antibiotherapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid followed by ceftriaxone at the correct dose.\nBiologically there was a severe inflammatory syndrome with sedimentation rate at 94mm/h, CRP at 96mg/l, leucocytosis at 13000/mm 3 with neutrophil polynucleosis, ferritinaemia elevated to 1100 microgram/l, (normal: 15-100), the 3 sets of blood cultures were sterile and the arthrocentesis fluid was inflammatory and sterile. Viral serologies [hepatitis B, C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)] were negative. Triglycerides were increased at 2g/l, LDH levels at 1000IU/l (normal 200-500IU/l). Liver and kidney functions were satisfactory, the calcium phosphate levels were normal and the cytobacteriological examination of urine was unremarkable. The rheumatoid and antinuclear factors were negative. The chest X-ray showed no infection site, the right hip ultrasound showed intra-articular effusion and the abdominal ultrasound found no lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of Still disease was made.\nAs soon as the first dose of corticosteroids was administered at 1mg/kg, there was a regression of the fever within 24 hours. In addition to corticosteroid therapy, bedrest was recommended during periods of relapses with a diet low in salt, sugar, fat, and the gradual addition of methotrexate at a low dose (10 mg/m 2 of body surface area). With this treatment, the progression was favourable."
