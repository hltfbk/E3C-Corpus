  "text": "A 42-year-old female presented to our hospital following a seizure accompanied by loss of consciousness, urinary incontinence, and the prolonged postictal state. She reports her seizures were initially well-controlled with Levetiracetam 500 mg twice a day but recently began experiencing seizures every other day despite up-titration of Levetiracetam to 1500 mg twice a day over a few weeks. On arrival, her serum ammonia level was 116 Î¼mol/L. CT brain was negative while CT liver was consistent with cirrhotic morphology. An electroencephalogram revealed irregular, diffuse, delta/theta slowing consistent with mild to moderate encephalopathy. The patient was started on lactulose 40mg and Rifaximin 550 mg twice a day. Her symptoms of disorientation and lethargy resolved over 3 days."
