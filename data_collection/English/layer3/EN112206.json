  "text": "We report a 58-year-old woman who experienced dysphagia for 6 d after eating fish. Cervical computed tomography (CT) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) indicated a fish bone completely embedded in the wall of the esophagus with endoscopic findings similar to those of submucosal tumors. The results of CT reconstruction and EUS suggested that the fish bone was parallel to the longitudinal axis of the esophagus. We performed a longitudinal mucosal incision from the highest point of the uplift by using an Olympus dual knife to find the fish bone. Unfortunately, no fish bone was found, so we extended the incision and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) technique was used to detect and remove the fish bone entirety."
