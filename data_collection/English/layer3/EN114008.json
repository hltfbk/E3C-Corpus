  "text": "We present a case of a 75-year-old male patient who underwent above-knee amputation of the right lower limb for severe crush injury right leg and a bipolar hemiarthroplasty for an ipsilateral fracture neck of femur sustained in the same road traffic accident. The treatment of neck of femur fracture in above-knee amputee patients is always a challenge for the orthopedic surgeon. We described the surgical technique in an attempt to overcome the challenges encountered in such a setting."
