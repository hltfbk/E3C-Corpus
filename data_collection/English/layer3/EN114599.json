  "text": "An 11-month-old boy presented with renal impairment associated with a truncal ataxia, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, hypotonia, delayed visual maturation and global developmental delay. Over a 9-year period, he progressed to chronic kidney disease stage V and developed a dilated cardiomyopathy. Abnormalities in renal and muscle biopsy as well as cytochrome c oxidase activity prompted genetic testing. After exclusion of mitochondrial DNA defects, nuclear genetic studies identified compound heterozygous RMND1 (c.713A>G, p. Asn238Ser and c.565C>T, p.Gln189*) variants."
