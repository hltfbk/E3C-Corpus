  "text": "We report a 53-year-old Chinese woman hospitalized in our hospital following the discovery of a submucosal protruding mass of the esophagus by upper endoscopy. A preliminary diagnosis of EBC was made by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), and treatment was accomplished by endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection (ESTD). The pathological results verified the diagnosis. No scar changes or cystic lesion within the original lesion were found under EUS after a 3-mo follow-up."
