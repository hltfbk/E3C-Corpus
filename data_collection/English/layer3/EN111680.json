  "text": "We report a case of a 55-year-old man who presented with a refractory ascites three months after liver transplantation for alcoholic cirrhosis. Prior to transplantation the patient had a minimal amount of ascites. The transplant procedure and the early postoperative course were uneventful. Standard post-transplant work up failed to reveal any typical cause of refractory post-transplant ascites. The function of the graft was good. Apart from atrial fibrillation, cardiac status was normal. Eighteen months post transplantation the patient developed dyspnea and severe fatigue with peripheral edema. Ascites was still prominent. The presenting signs of right-sided heart failure were highly suggestive of cardiac etiology. Diagnostic paracentesis was suggestive of cardiac ascites, and further cardiac evaluation showed typical signs of constrictive pericarditis. Pericardiectomy was performed followed by complete resolution of ascites. On the follow-up the patient remained symptom-free with no signs of recurrent ascites and with normal function of the liver graft."
