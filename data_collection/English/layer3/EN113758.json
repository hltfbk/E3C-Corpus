  "text": "A 74-year-old man presented with multiple left neck masses. Abdominal computed tomography showed a thickened gastric wall and multiple lymphadenopathies including left supraclavicular lymph node. Gastroenterological endoscopy revealed tumor lesions in the gastric cardia. Tumor biopsy indicated a pathological diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Open left cervical lymph node biopsy showed histological features identical with the gastric tumor, indicating left clavicle lymph node metastasis of GC. After 2 years of chemo-immunotherapy with S-1/CDDP, paclitaxel, and cytokine-activated killer cells, lesions other than the stomach lesion had regressed to undetectable on imaging studies. The patient then underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction followed by adjuvant chemo-immunotherapy with paclitaxel and S-1 for 1 year, and immunotherapy with tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell-activated killer cells for 5 years. The patient remained well after 5 years and 6 months of follow-up, with no signs of recurrence."
