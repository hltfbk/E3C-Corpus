  "text": "We report on two male patients, aged 23 and 27 years, who presented with eruptive xanthomas. Clinical, histological and laboratory investigations disclosed a metabolic syndrome in the younger patient and an alcohol-induced chylomicronemia in the elder one. Two types of macromorphology of cutaneous lesions were observed. Treatment was tailored according to underlying pathologies and resulted in significant improvement of the metabolic parameters and improvement of skin lesions."
