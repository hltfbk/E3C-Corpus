  "text": "We present a case of a 68-year-old woman who underwent a computed tomography scan of the abdomen in the work-up for recently diagnosed hypertension. A non-enhancing left renal sinus mass was detected extending to the para-aortic space. The initial diagnosis was that of a tumor of the collecting system. Nephro-ureterectomy was performed and the pathology results revealed changes of chronic pyelonephritis."
