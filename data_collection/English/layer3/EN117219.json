  "text": "We report a case of a 55-year-old Japanese woman who had native valve endocarditis with L. garvieae. The case was complicated by renal infarction, cerebral infarction, and mycotic aneurysms. After anti-microbial treatment, she was discharged from the hospital and is now well while being monitored in the out-patient clinic."
