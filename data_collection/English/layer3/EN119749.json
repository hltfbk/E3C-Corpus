  "text": "A case of a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, and distorted intracardiac anatomy is presented. Intracardiac echocardiography showed a small oval fossa abouting to an enlarged aorta anteriorly. A very small distance from the interatrial septum to the left atrial free wall was seen. The latter two conditions were predisposing to a complicated transseptal puncture. According to fluoroscopy the transseptal needle had a correct position, but the intracardiac echo image showed that it was actually pointing towards the aortic root and most importantly, that it was virtually impossible to stabilize it in the fossa itself. Based on intracardiac echo findings a decision was made to limit the procedure only to ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus and not to proceed further so as to avoid complications."
