  "text": "case 1 48 year-old male patient was hospitalized with a complaint of abdominal pain and nausea that had been going on for about eight months. The patient had no peculiarity in his anamnesis and family history. The patient had been smoking for 10 package/years. His physical examination revealed icteric 2 cm long hepatomegaly and 4 cm splenomegaly. His laboratory results were as follows: Glucose: 86 mg/dl, Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dl, AST: 92 U/L, ALT: 89 U/L, ALP: 139 U/L, GGT: 386 U/L, LDH:162 U/L, Total bilirubin: 6.3 mg/dl, Conjugated bilirubin: 6.0 mg/dl, Albumin:3.2 g/dl, Amylase: 1523 U/L, Lipase: 1254 U/L, Wbc: 5060 mm 3, Hct: 38.4%, Platelet:109.000 mm 3 Prothrombrin time: 14 sec, AFP:4.1 ng/mL and HbsAg: positive. In his abdominal ultrasonography (USG) and portal vein doppler USG, the liver had a cirrhotic appearance and splenomegaly was found. His gastroscopy revealed grade III esophageal varicosis. His dynamic contrasted abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) showed intrahepatic bile ducts dillated, choledoch normal, acute pancreatitis and in fourth segment of the left lobe of the liver a mass without typical wash-out but intense contrast in the arterial phase with a size of 10x8 cm and his MR angiography showed thrombus on the portal vein left branch. The result of mass biopsy was reported as focal nodular hyperplasia. Tenofovir was started and his endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a mass with a diameter of 10 cm and thrombus on the portal vein in the left lobe of the liver. Biopsy was taken from the thrombus with 25 G FNA needle. The biopsy showed big irregular atypical cells in groups some of which were distributed alone and in some places looked like trabecular structures and he was diagnosed as HCC. The patient underwent radiofrequency embolisation and he was taken under control. Case 2 50-year-old male patient. The patient had been receiving antiviral treatment for 13 years with a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B and he was under control. Five years ago, a mass with a diameter of 2 cm was found in the eighth segment of the liver. The patient was operated and his pathology was reported as HCC. The patient who developed abdominal pain in his follow-ups was hospitalized. The patient had no peculiarity in his anamnesis and family history. He had been using tenofovir 245 mg/day and had been smoking for 10 package/years. His physical examination was normal. His laboratory findings were as follows: Glucose: 86 mg/dl, Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dl, AST: 92 U/L, ALT: 89 U/L, ALP: 139 U/L, GGT: 386 U/L, LDH:162 U/L, Total bilirubin: 6.3 mg/dl, Conjugated bilirubin: 6.0 mg/dl, Albumin:3.2 g/dl, Wbc: 5060 mm 3, Hct: 38.4%, Platelet:109.000 mm 3, Prothrombrin time: 14 sec, AFP:4.1 ng/mL and HbsAg: positive, HBV DNA: negative. His abdominal tomography (AT) showed a solid mass with a regular contour in the left lobe of the liver next to the lateral segment anterior. The mass had extrahepatic location, it had a size of 80x52 mm, it had a heterogeneous inner structure, it had intense contrast at arterial phase but it did not have typical wash-out. AT angiography showed thrombus at the portal vein left branch. The patient underwent EUS and biopsy was taken from the mass on the left lobe of the liver with 22 G needle and FNA biopsy was taken from the thrombus on the portal vein with 25G needle. The biopsy results of both the mass in the liver and the thrombus were HCC. The patient underwent radiofrequency embolisation and he was taken under control. Case 3 77-year-old male patient. The patient was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B four years ago and started lamivudin 100 mg/day. The patient who did not come to his controls was hospitalized with complaints of swellings on the legs, asthenia and pain in joints. The patient had no peculiarity in his anamnesis and family history and he was not smoking or drinking. His physical examination revealed faintness, moderate edema, 2 cm splenomegaly and arthritis on the left toe and left ankle. His laboratory findings were as follows: Glucose: 86 mg/dl, Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dl, AST: 81 U/L, ALT: 95 U/L, ALP: 56 U/L, GGT: 28 U/L, LDH:217 U/L, Total bilirubin: 0.8 mg/dl, Conjugated bilirubin: 0.5 mg/dl,Albumin:3.3g/dl,Wbc:4550mm 3, Hct: 30.2%, Platelet:213.000mm 3, Prothrombrin time: 18 sec, AFP:1.1 ng/mL and HbsAg: positive, HBV DNA: 1.270.000 IU, Anti delta total (+) and HDV RNA (-). His abdominal MR showed cirrhotic liver, a mass lesion with a size of 70x45 mm on the seventh segment of the right lobe. T1A examination showed that the central of the mass lesion was hyperintense, its periphery was hypointense; postcontrasted examination showed that it did not show an obvious contrast but it showed diffusion limits. In the eighth segment of the right lobe of the liver, a centrally located 25x20 mm lesion was seen which extended to the inferior vena cava and caused tumor thrombus in the vena cava. EUS showed masses with diameters of 7 cm and 2 cm on the seventh and eighth segments of the liver and thrombus that extended to the vena cava inferior. Biopsy was taken from the thrombus with 25 G FNA needle. Biopsy result showed HCC. The patient underwent radiofrequency embolisation and he was taken under control."
