  "text": "An 80-year-old male presented with epigastric pain. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a linear, hyperdense, foreign body that penetrated through the posterior wall of the gastric antrum. There was no evidence of free air, abscess formation, migration of the foreign body into the pancreas, or pancreatitis. As the patient had a history of fish bone ingestion, we made a diagnosis of localized peritonitis caused by fish bone penetration of the posterior wall of the gastric antrum. We first attempted to remove the foreign body endoscopically, but failed because it was not detected. Hence, an emergency laparoscopic surgery was performed. A linear, hard, foreign body penetrated through the posterior wall of the gastric antrum and was embedded in the pancreas. The foreign body was safely removed laparoscopically and was identified as a 2.5-cm-long fish bone. Intraperitoneal lavage was performed, and a drain was placed in the lesser sac. The patient recovered without complications and was discharged on the 7th postoperative day."
