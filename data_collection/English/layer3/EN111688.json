  "text": "A 55-year-old man developed severe lower back pain after sudden movement. Over the next 5 days he developed paraesthesiaes in the feet, progressing to the torso gradually, and reported constipation and reduced sensation when passing urine. On day six he developed left facial palsy, and later gradual-onset headache and intermittent confusion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed diffuse subarachnoid FLAIR hyperintensity, concerning for blood, including a focus of cortical/subcortical high signal in the left superior parietal lobule, which was confirmed by computed tomography. Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a left VAD with a fusiform aneurysm."
