  "text": "A 68-year-old woman was brought to our hospital with repeated right upper abdominal pain lasting for 3 months and aggravation for 9 h. Computed tomography (CT) showed a streaky high-density shadow (approximately 3 cm in length) on the posterior wall of the gastric antrum extending outside the wall. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed hyperechoic space with a cross-section of approximately 0.1 × 0.1 cm in the deep submucosal layer of the local stomach, accompanied by an acoustic shadow in the rear. The possibility of a fishbone as well as perforation was considered and the object was removed using FB forceps. Fasting as well as acid inhibition and anti-infection medication were prescribed for the patient. She eventually recovered and was discharged from the hospital."
