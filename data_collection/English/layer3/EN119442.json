  "text": "A 24 years old female with Thrombocytopenia and absent radius syndrome admitted with pelvic fracture was investigated for recurrent urinary tract infections. Abdominal ultrasonography could not visualise the kidney on right side. Further extensive investigations in the form of intravenous urography (IVU), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and renal isotope scans revealed a crossed fused renal ectopia."
