  "text": "A 6-year old male infant from the West Region of Cameroon infected with HIV who presented at a local health center with a 10 days history of productive cough associated with nocturnal fever and abdominal pains non responsive to broad spectrum antibiotics. A sputum sample analysis requested was smear positive for acid-fast bacilli, and he was initiated on quadritherapy for drug sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis. Since he was a household contact of the mother who was being managed in a referral hospital for MDR-TB at 1 month of treatment, and given his critical clinical situation, a gastric aspirate was repeated and sent for Xpert MTB/RIF to the Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory which was positive for a Rifampicin resistant strain of M. tuberculosis. The short 9 months regimen against MDR-TB was then initiated. During the course of his management, he developed minor side effects of the drugs which were managed symptomatically."
