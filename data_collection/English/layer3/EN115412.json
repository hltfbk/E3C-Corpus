  "text": "Patient 1 was a Caucasian man who had been diagnosed at age 15 years with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome with symptoms of fluctuating muscle weakness and easy fatigability. These symptoms stabilized, and his electrophysiological parameters normalized, during treatment with a maintenance dose of 50mg/day of 3,4-diaminopyridine. After 5.5 years, however, he wished to discontinue the treatment. After that point, his electrophysiological parameters and presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium-channel antibody titer remained stable. During the 15-year follow-up period, patient 1 reported mild exertion-induced complaints but did not feel restricted in his occupation and most daily activities. Patient 2 was a Caucasian man diagnosed at 32 years of age with a moderate limb girdle syndrome. He was treated with up to 80 mg/day of 3,4-diaminopyridine. Because of the drug's very short-lasting effect (<1 hour), however, he took it mostly irregularly (≤ 1 × 20 mg/day). During the 14- year period of observation, his repetitive nerve stimulation responses and presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium-channel antibody titer remained stable, his compound muscle action potential amplitudes were decreasing and his clinical symptoms did not deteriorate. At his last follow-up examination, patient 2 was independent in all of his daily activities."
