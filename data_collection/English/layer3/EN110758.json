  "text": "A 47-year-old woman with spinocerebellar degeneration was admitted because of a well-defined mass measuring 48 × 31 mm in anterior mediastinum. She showed limb, truncal, ocular, and speech ataxia; hypotonia; areflexia; sensory disturbances; and muscle weakness. Her eastern cooperative oncology group performance status was 4. Surgical resection was performed via video-assisted thoracic surgery and under general anesthesia only without epidural analgesia. The mass was diagnosed as type B1 thymoma without capsular invasion (Masaoka stage I). The patients got a good postoperative course by cooperation with anesthesiologists and neurologists in perioperative managements. She has been well over 3 years of follow-up."
