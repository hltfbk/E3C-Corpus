  "text": "A 75-year-old asymptomatic woman presented with a 10-cm-diameter mass on chest radiography that was not evident 6 months prior. She had been taking warfarin for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and a transient ischemic attack. There was no history of chest trauma, warfarin overdosing, or any suspected interactions with other drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antibiotics. The prothrombin time/international normalized ratio(PT-INR) was prolonged at 4.73 and her hemoglobin level was 8.7 g/dl. Chest computed tomography(CT)revealed an air-fluid mass adjacent to the right upper and middle lobes with a pleural effusion. A CT scan obtained 15 years prior revealed a cyst at the corresponding site and the mass was diagnosed as a warfarin-related hemorrhage within the pre-existing pulmonary cyst. We performed a surgical resection of the cyst to prevent any worsening hemorrhage and subsequent infection. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 3rd postoperative day."
