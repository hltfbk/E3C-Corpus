  "text": "A 66 year old black African patient with a 2 year history of hypertension was admitted to the emergency department of the Buea Regional hospital, a semi-urban setting in Cameroon, after presenting with syncope while in church. The wife described a similar episode 2 weeks prior without any further evaluation. Upon arrival at the emergency, patient had regained consciousness but lethargic, tachypneic and diaphoretic. The blood pressure was 85/61 mmHg; the pulse was 219/min, weak and thready. He had cold extremities. A 12 lead electrocardiogram performed showed a sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia at 230/min. He was administered six tablets of amiodarone, oxygen by nasal cannula and intravenous fluids. No electrical cardioversion was attempted due to the non availability of a defibrillator. Outcome was fatal with death of the patient 30 min after his arrival to the emergency."
