  "text": "A 61-year-old Caucasian British man was referred to our unit with recent onset of severe left calf and thigh claudication and rest pain in his left foot. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed occlusive disease of the left common femoral artery, proximal superficial and profunda femoral arteries. These findings were confirmed intraoperatively and an endarterectomy was subsequently performed from the left common femoral onto the proximal superficial femoral artery and then onto the proximal profunda femoris artery. The arteriotomy was closed with a Dacron patch and its distal end was bisected into two to patch the profunda femoris and superficial femoral arteries. The patient made an uneventful recovery with a full clinical improvement of his left leg."
