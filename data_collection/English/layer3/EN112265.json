  "text": "A 57-year-old Caucasian female was found unconscious following application of long-lasting insulin detemir and ingestion of elemental mercury in a suicidal attempt. Diagnostic investigations revealed several radiopaque collections in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and elevated mercury levels in the blood. Much of the ingested elemental mercury was eliminated from the GI tract with stools stimulated by several enemas. However, a significant amount of mercury remained sequestrated in the appendix despite all conservative measures. Consequently, following deliberations by an interdisciplinary team of specialists, laparoscopic appendectomy was performed 29 d after the mercury ingestion. The surgery itself and postoperative course were uneventful."
