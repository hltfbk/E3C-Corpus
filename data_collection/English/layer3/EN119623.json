  "text": "We present a case report of testicular seminoma in a 56 year old man with previously unreported histological findings. In this case seminoma tumour cells did not appear to have spread by the expected lymphatic route. There was no involvement of retro-peritoneal para-aortic lymph nodes. The tumour appeared to have spread directly along the vas deferans in the sub epithelial plane to the mesenteric lymph nodes."
