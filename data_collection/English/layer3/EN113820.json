  "text": "We report a 53-year-old woman with a large unilateral water clear cell parathyroid hyperplasia associated with primary hyperparathyroidism and severe osteoporosis. Ultrasonography showed a 5.4Â cm multilobulated hypoechoic well defined mass localized in the lower half of the left thyroid lobe. Technetium sestamibi scanning showed a persistent very large area of increased activity possibly corresponding to a left inferior double parathyroid adenoma. At surgery, two large merged lobulated parathyroid glands were removed from the left superior and inferior aspects of the adjacent thyroid extending to the sub-clavicular area. Histopathology showed polygonal hyperplastic vacuolated cells with abundant water clear cytoplasm. The lesion had lack of capsule or rim of parathyroid tissue and immunohistochemistry was positive for PTH staining. These findings were consistent with diffused water clear cell hyperplasia. After parathyroidectomy, iPTH and calcium levels dropped immediately."
