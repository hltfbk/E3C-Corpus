  "text": "A 53-year-old male patient was evaluated in September 2005, with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis for 2 years. He presented with tachycardia (130 bpm) and a large goiter. Thyrotropin was <0.01 uIU/ml (0,41-4,5), free thyroxin >7.77 ng/dl (0.9-1.8), anti-thyreoperoxidase antibody: 374 IU/ml (<35) and anti-thyroglobulin antibody: 749 IU/ml (<115). Ultrasound: diffuse goiter, no nodules; right lobe: 7.9 x 3.8 x 3.8 cm; left: 7.7 x 3.5 x 3.8 cm; isthmus: 1.6 cm. Propylthiouracil 300 mg t.i.d. and propranolol were prescribed. Thyroid (99m)Tc-pertechnetate uptake: 52% (0.35-1.7%) and estimated thyroid volume: 149 mL. After 30 days, he received 555 MBq (15 mCi) of (131)I-iodide. Six months after radioiodine therapy, under methimazole 40 mg, thyroid stimulating hormone was 1.5 uIU/ml; free thyroxine 0.54 ng/dl. Methimazole was suspended. In 21 days, thyroid stimulating hormone was 0.03 uIU/ml; free thyroxine 0.96 ng/dl. Methimazole was reintroduced. One year later, thyroid stimulating hormone was <0.01 uIU/ml and free thyroxine >7.77 ng/dl. Thyroid (99m)Tc-pertechnetate uptake was 45% and estimated thyroid volume 144 mL. A 1110 MBq (30 mCi) radioiodine therpy was administered. He used Methimazole for 8 months, when overt hypothyroidism appeared (TSH: 25.30 uIU/ml; free thyroxine: 0.64 ng/dl). Methimazole was interrupted. Hyperthyroidism returned 6 weeks later (thyroid stimulating hormone <0.01 uIU/ml; free thyroxine >7.77 ng/dl). Thyroid (99m)Tc-pertechnetate uptake was 25% and estimated thyroid volume 111 mL. Methimazole was prescribed again. In March 2008 he received a 2590 MBq (70 mCi) radioiodine therapy. By may/2008, under methimazole 20 mg, his TSH was 0.07 uIU/ml; free thyroxine 1.31 ng/dl. In October 2008 he presented overt hypothyroidism (TSH 91.6 uIU/ml; free thyroxine 0.34) and was given levothyroxine 75 mcg/day. He remains euthyroid under hormone replacement."
