  "text": "The proband was born pre-term to a 34-year-old mother with a history of two first trimester miscarriages and an early infant death. She was referred at the age of 8 months for genetic evaluation due to prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, developmental delay and multiple congenital anomalies. On clinical evaluation, she had craniofacial dysmorphic features such as scaphocephaly, large anterior fontanelle with open posterior fontanelle, prominent occiput, triangular face, high forehead, hypertelorism, down slanting eyes, flat nasal bridge, small nose, low set ears, micro-retrognathia, high arched palate and short neck. Cranial computerized tomography scan showed lateral ventriculomegaly with features of early cerebral atrophy. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed the karyotype 46,XX,der(14)t(7;14)(q22;q32)mat in the proband due to an unbalanced segregation of a maternal balanced translocation t(7;14)(q22;q32). Fluorescence in-situ hybridization analysis confirmed the partial trisomy 7q22 → qter in the proband with a minimal loss of genetic material on chromosome 14. Single nucleotide polymorphism array further confirmed the duplication on chromosome 7q22.1 → qter and a small terminal deletion on chromosome 14q32.3 → qter."
