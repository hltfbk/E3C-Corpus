  "text": "We present here a 49-year-old patient who presented to the clinic with a history of chronic scrotal sinus on the same side of a repeatedly repaired inguinal hernia 4 months before admission. He underwent exploration of the inguinal canal as elective surgery. Exploration of the inguinal canal revealed missed surgical gauze left during the previous hernia repair. The gauze was removed, and the inguinal canal was repaired. The postoperative period was uncomplicated."
