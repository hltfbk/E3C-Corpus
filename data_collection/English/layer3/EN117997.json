  "text": "A 27-year-old woman presented with obstructive jaundice, vomiting, pruritus, abdominal pain and an epigastric mass. A diagnosis of a pancreatic cyst causing a compression of the common bile buct was established by ultrasonography and CT scan before surgery. Hydatic serology was negative. The treatment consisted of the resection of the protruding dome with a drainage of the residual cavity and an omentoplasty. The recovery was uneventful and the patient has remained symptom free so far."
