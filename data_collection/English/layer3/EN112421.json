  "text": "Fifty-four year-old male with a history of orthotropic heart transplant in 2001 on immunosuppressive therapy presented with palpitations and associated lightheadedness. He had a blood pressure of 184/89 mmHg on arrival but otherwise had stable vital signs and physical examination. Cardiac biomarkers revealed a CK of 59 U/L and a troponin of 0.11NG/ML(normal < 0.04NG/ML). B type natriuretic peptide was 371 PG/ML(normal 0-100PG/ML). Routine laboratory studies demonstrated normal sodium, magnesium, serum creatinine, and a potassium of 3.3 mmol/L(normal 3.5-5.1 mmol/L). His hemoglobin and hematocrit were normal. His EKG showed sinus rhythm with old T wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads. Echocardiogram revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55-65%, left posterior wall of 1.3 cm and interventricular septal wall 1.2 cm, thickened trabeculated apex, with severely dilated left atrium. He had a stress test that showed mild inferior wall thinning and a cardiac MRI performed to further evaluate apical hypertrophy revealed prominent apical hypertrophy of the left ventricle with near obliteration of the apical cavity. He had no events on cardiac monitoring and was discharged with close followup with the transplant team."
