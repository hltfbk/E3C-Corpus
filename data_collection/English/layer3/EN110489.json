  "text": "Mrs B.K 52 years old, gravida 6, parity 5, presented with bilateral axillary masses evolving since adolescence. Initially they were small swellings of 2 cm in the right side and 4 cm in the left side, they gradually grew larger during pregnancy with a sudden, significant increase in size after delivery. They were occasionally painful and reduce the left arm movement. Physical examination revealed a 12x10 cm and 6x8 cm masses respectively in the left and right axilla they both were mobile, painless and firm in consistency. Skin over the swelling was hyperpigmented and free from underlying structures. There was no nipple or areola over the masses. The bilateral breasts were normal without any palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Investigations: all routine investigations were within normal limits. Mammography and breast ultrasound examination gives an indication to the diagnosis of supernumerary breast tissue. Treatment: an excisional biopsy was performed under general anesthesia and the tissue was sent for histopathology. Grossly on sectioning, we found an adipose tissue. Microscopic examination showed mostly mature adipose tissue interspersed with breast tissue having lobular architecture. Numerous ducts and acini were seen lined by ductular epithelial cells. Thus, histopathological features were consistent with the accessory breast tissue."
