  "text": "A 43-year-old male suffered high-voltage electrical injury through his left arm. He underwent cataract surgery in both eyes 3 months after the injury, but there was no vision improvement. Ocular examination, including spectral domain optical coherence tomography, revealed diffuse retinal atrophy in the left eye which did not change until the final visit. In the right eye, an impending macular hole was observed but regressed spontaneously 9 months after the injury, and the visual acuity improved to 20/32 at the final visit."
