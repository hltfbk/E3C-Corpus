  "text": "We retrospectively evaluated 8 patients who underwent laparoscopic anterior gastropexy for large hiatal hernia (type III or IV) since 2006. All patients were women with a median age of 82 years (range, 74-87 years). The major complaint was obstruction in all patients, with relatively mild reflux symptoms. They underwent successful laparoscopic surgery with no conversion to laparotomy. Fundoplication was performed in 4 cases. No perioperative complications occurred, and the main complaint resumed rapidly in all patients, without recurrence during postoperative follow-up of median 48 months (range, 5-77 months)."
