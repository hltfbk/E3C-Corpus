  "text": "An 85 years old black woman presented with complain of a large swelling over right abdomen for around 25 years. The swelling increased progressively over the years and it is associated with post-prandial discomfort. Her bowel habits were normal and there was no urinary complain. There was no history of trauma or any surgical procedure in the past. Her past medical history included hypertension for the last 10 years ago with regular treatment. Her physical examination revealed a huge mass of 25 x 30 cm occupying right flank and right lumbar region extending up to the umbilicus and inguinal region. Cough impulse was present. The mass was round shaped, soft, mild tender and partially reducible with gurgling sound. Percussion notes were resonant, and bowel sounds were present over the mass.\nA clinical impression of a giant Spigelian hernia was made. Laboratory investigations were made, all within the normal limits. An abdominal ultrasonography was performed. The ultrasonogram report suggested the probability of Spigelian hernia and advised CT scan for confirmation. CT scan was not done because of financial limitation of the patient. The final diagnosis of Spigelian hernia was made. After establishing the diagnosis of Spigelian hernia operative open intervention was planned. Intraoperatively it was found to be intraparietal inguinal hernia. Surgery started with transversal incision over the mass, after external oblique fascia opened careful exploration revealed that the hernia sac was lying in between external & internal oblique muscles; the hernia sac was coming out of a very widely dilated deep inguinal ring of about 5 cm diameter and extending forward superiorly and laterally as well as medially. A long viable segment of the small bowel with their mesentery was the content of the sac. The hernia sac was ligated at the deep inguinal ring as in traditional inguinal herniorrhaphy. A polypropylene mesh placement at the posterior wall of the inguinal canal was done.\nPost-operative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on third postoperative day, she has now been on our follow-up for the last 6 months and is doing well. Informed con-sent was taken from the patient for the publication of this case report and accompanying images."
