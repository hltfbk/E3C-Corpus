  "text": "We describe a case of an invasive cardiac lipoma, wherein the initial symptom of the patient was shortness of breath. Although the echocardiogram visualized the tumor in the right atrium, a cardiac MRI was performed for better tissue characterization. The MRI revealed a large, fat containing, septated mass in the right atrium with invasion into the inter-atrial septum and inferior cavoatrial junction. There was also invasion of the coronary sinus along the inferior and left lateral aspect of the posterior atrioventricular groove. Although the mass appeared to represent a lipoma by imaging characteristics, the unusual extension into the coronary sinus led to consideration of a low-grade liposarcoma in the differential. Thus a pre-operative biopsy was performed along with MDM2 gene amplification to rule out a liposarcoma preceding surgical excision."
