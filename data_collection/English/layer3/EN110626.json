  "text": "A 62-year-old man complained of a 14-d history of fever accompanied by dry cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, myalgia, nausea, and vomiting. Real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. The patient was treated with supplementary oxygen by nasal cannula and gamma globulin. Other symptomatic treatments included antibacterial and antiviral treatments. On day 4 of hospitalization, he reported sudden onset of dyspnea. On day 6, he was somnolent. On day 12, the patient reported worsening right-sided chest pain which eventually progressed to bilateral chest pain. He was diagnosed with SPM, with no clear trigger found. Conservative treatment was administrated. During follow-up, the pneumomediastinum had resolved and the patient recovered without other complications."
