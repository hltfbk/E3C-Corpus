  "text": "A 24-year-old man was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type I and burdened with a large plexiform neurofibroma on the buttocks and upper posterior thighs. The patient was 159 cm in height and 70.0 kg in weight at the first visit. Cardiac overload was indicated by an echocardiography before surgery. His cardiac output was 5.2 L/min with mild tricuspid regurgitation. After embolism of the arteries feeding the tumor, the patient underwent surgery to remove the neurofibroma, followed by skin grafting. Follow-up echocardiography, performed 6 months after the final surgery, indicated a decreased cardiac output (3.6 L/min) with improvement of tricuspid regurgitation. Because the blood loss during the first surgery was over 3.8 L, malnutrition with albuminemia was induced and half of the skin graft did not attach. Nutritional support to improve the albuminemia produced better results following a second surgery to repair the skin wound."
