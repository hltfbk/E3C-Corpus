  "text": "A dialysis patient, aged 19 years at the time of this report, with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from childhood; he was an early-preterm baby with very low birth weight (910 g), and is affected by a so-far unidentified familial nephropathy. He started dialysis in emergency at the age of 17. Except for low-dose Bisoprolol, he refused all chronic medication; hypertension (165-200/90-130 mmHg) did not respond to attainment of dry weight (Kt/V > 1.7; BNP 70-200 pg/ml pre-dialysis). He underwent subtotal PTX 1 year after dialysis start; after PTX, his blood pressure stabilized in the 100-140/50-80 range, and is normal without treatment 5 months later."
