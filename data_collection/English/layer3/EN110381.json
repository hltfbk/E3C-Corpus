  "text": "An 18 year-old woman referred having an infectious symptomatology of the right breast 5 months ago for which she received an anti-infectious therapy inducing regression of inflammatory symptoms presented with a quick growing mass involving the two inferior quadrants of the right breast, but did not consult any doctor until it reached 10cm in its size. She had no history of breast trauma and no breast cancer in her family.\nAn ultrasound of the right breast was performed and revealed a significant infiltration of the breast fat tissue with multiple intra-mammary lesions that may be related to the collection of infectious origin. Breast MRI showed a 12 x 10 x 6cm mass with solid and hyper vascularized components with significant enhancement.\nMicrobiopsies revealed a malignant proliferation made of dilated, branching vascular structures with a high mitotic index reaching 10 mitoses per 10 high power fields evoking a well-differentiated angiosarcoma. The immunohistochemical study using anti-CD31 and anti-CD34 antibodies showed a diffuse and intense staining of the neoplastic cells.\nA mastectomy with lymph node dissection was performed. The gross examination showed the presence of a 12.5x11x6 cm bluish mass with haemorrhagic changes. Microscopic examination confirmed the angiosarcomatous proliferation made of endothelial cells focally producing papillary formations and projecting tufts into the lumen of the vessels. The tumour cells infiltrate the adipose tissue, where vascular lumens become inconspicuous. The immunohistochemical study confirmed the angiosarcomatous nature of proliferation since there was a diffuse and intense positivity to anti-CD34 and anti-CD31 antibodies. Lymph nodes invasion was absent. Chest CT scan and bone scintigraphy revealed no metastases."
