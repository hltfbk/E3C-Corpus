  "text": "Our patient is a 66 years old man, case of rheumatoid arthritis with lymphadenopathy due to vasculitis, which was underdiagnosed due to lack of complete clinical data during pathologic examination. Since the patient was extremely ill, and the workup was inconclusive, the pathology slides were sent to our center for consultation and molecular study to rule out lymphoma. The slide review was done with complete access to the patient's history and status. In addition to reactive follicular hyperplasia, there was inter-follicular/paracortical plasma cell infiltration and remarkable leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small vessels."
