  "text": "This report describes the case of an 81-year-old man who developed sudden-onset pure hemi-chorea in the right limbs resulting from an acute phase of left thalamic lacunar infarction detected on a diffusion-weighted image (DWI) in an MRI study. The patient had no other neurological symptoms such as ataxic hemiparesis and sensory disturbance. A single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study using the (99m)Tc-ECD Patlak plot method demonstrated significant perfusional asymmetry between the right and left thalami (p = 0.0035), consistent with the left thalamic lesion on DWI."
