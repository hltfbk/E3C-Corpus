  "text": "A 69-year-old previously well Sinhalese man presented with lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting, and altered behavior of 1 week's duration. An examination revealed Glasgow Coma Scale of 13/15 and marginally low blood pressure. Initial serum sodium level was 104 mmol/L, and plasma and urinary osmolalities were 251 mOsm/kg and 305 mOsm/kg, respectively. His urinary sodium level of 158 mmol/L was suggestive of a clinical picture of a syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Even after correction of hyponatremia with intravenously administered 3% saline, a persistent altered behavior necessitated cerebral imaging that confirmed the presence of pituitary macroadenoma. Meanwhile, his hormone profile showed very low serum cortisol and low free tetraiodothyronine levels. An ultrasound scan of his abdomen affirmed the presence of normal adrenal glands. With intravenously administered hydrocortisone and orally administered levothyroxine replacement, he showed marked clinical improvement that supported the diagnosis of hypopituitarism."
