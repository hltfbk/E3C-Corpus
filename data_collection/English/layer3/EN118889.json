  "text": "Seventy year-old male patient referred with complaints of weakness and involuntary movements in left arm, changes in behavior, and forgetfulness. He also developed akinetic mutism after nearly three months. In EEG periodic triphasic waves were seen. Despite the absence of any apparent pathological finding in T2 and FLAIR MRI, excluding signs of atrophy, on DW MRI hyperintense signal changes in cortical regions (cortical ribboning) were observed. Protein 14-3-3 in CSF was detected."
