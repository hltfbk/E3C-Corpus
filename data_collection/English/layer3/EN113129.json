  "text": "We present a case of a 68-year-old man with a history of Type 2 DM and symptomatic peripheral artery disease, referred to our hospital due to an infected lower extremity DFU. Cultures revealed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. There was a significant increase of inflammatory marker levels and plain X-rays revealed osteomyelitis. He underwent lower extremity angioplasty for the restoration of the blood flow. He received targeted intravenous antibiotic therapy for 2Â weeks and continued ciprofloxacin along with clindamycin per os for 10 more weeks as outpatient."
