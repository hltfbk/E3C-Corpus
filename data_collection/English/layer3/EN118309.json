  "text": "We report two cases of antenatally diagnosed left-sided diaphragmatic hernia that were repaired with a patch due to total absence of a diaphragm. Both Caucasian patients developed recurrent late graft complications. Case one was repaired on day 17 post-stabilisation and developed recurrence at 14(1/2) months of age and again at 26 months of age. Case 2 underwent surgery on day 13 of life and developed recurrence at 4 months and again at 3 years of age. In the recurrent repairs, both synthetic and biomaterial patches were used. Both patients are well at long-term follow-up of 10 and 7 years, respectively."
