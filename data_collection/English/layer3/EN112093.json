  "text": "Here, we describe a six-year-old boy with diabetes mellitus, anemia, and deafness. Additionally, he presented with thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, horizontal nystagmus, hepatomegaly, short stature, ventricular premature beat (VPB), and cerebral infarction. DNA sequencing revealed a novel compound heterozygous mutation in the SLC19A2 gene: (1) a duplication c.405dupA, p.Ala136Serfs*3 (heterozygous) and (2) a nucleotide deletion c.903delG p.Trp301Cysfs*13 (heterozygous). The patient was diagnosed with a typical TRMA."
