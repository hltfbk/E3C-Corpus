  "text": "A 44-year-old female was treated for repeated episodes of hemoptysis and one episode of respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support. She had minor urinary abnormalities in the form of microscopic hematuria and non-nephrotic proteinuria. She also had positive C-ANCA. Her lung biopsy showed evidence of intra-alveolar hemorrhage with linear IgG deposits in the basement membrane of the alveolar capillaries. Owing to these lung biopsy findings, a kidney biopsy was carried out, which showed minimal thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and linear IgG and C3 deposits along the capillary walls. Her renal function remained persistently normal."
