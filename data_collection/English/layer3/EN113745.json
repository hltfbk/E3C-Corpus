  "text": "We present the case of an active 84-year-old man who sustained a three-part fracture-dislocation of the proximal humerus combined with a long spiral humeral middle third diaphyseal fracture, after a ski fall. We were unable to find a similar case in the literature. He was treated with a long stem hemiarthroplasty, associated with screw osteosynthesis of the long spiral shaft fracture. The result after 30 months of follow-up was excellent, with good shoulder range of motion, good bone integration of the prosthesis and uneventful healing of the fracture."
