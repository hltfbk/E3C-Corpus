  "text": "A 30-year-old grand multiparous Turkish woman without any history of uterine surgery gave birth vaginally at 37 weeks of gestation with fundal pressure applied in the second stage of labor. Transabdominal sonography performed 32 hours after delivery due to postural hypotension and a drop in hemoglobin values in the postpartum period revealed massive intra-abdominal free fluid. On emergency laparotomy, serosal rupture of the uterus on the left posterior side was observed. She underwent a subtotal hysterectomy and did well postoperatively."
