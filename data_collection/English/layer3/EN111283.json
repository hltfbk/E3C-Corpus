  "text": "A 38-year-old male patient presented with recurrent nasal bleeding for 24 months and progressive obstruction of the right nasal cavity for 8 months. Diagnostic nasal endoscopy showed a greyish mass filling the whole of the right nasal cavity and contrast-enhanced CT scan of the nose and paranasal sinus revealed a large heterogeneous contrast enhanced lesion in the nasal cavity. The endoscopic biopsy was suggestive of cavernous hemangioma. Endoscopic excision was done and the patient has been followed up for the past 12 months without any recurrence of the disease."
