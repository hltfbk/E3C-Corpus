  "text": "A 40-year-old Turkish man was admitted to our institution with a large left adrenal mass that was identified during the work-up for shortness of breath. The patient did not have specific signs and symptoms of hormone excess. The mass was removed surgically. The pathological findings were consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma. The patient was also found to have a multicentric papillary thyroid microcarcinoma."
