  "text": "A 33-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital because of an abnormal pulmonary shadow. Computed tomography showed two aberrant arteries arising from the descending aorta and running into the lower lung lobes on each side, without any bronchial anomaly. He was diagnosed with bilateral anomalous systemic supply to the basal segments. A left thoracotomy was performed and the aberrant arteries were ligated and dissected at their origin followed by left basal segmentectomy. Simultaneous right S10 segmentectomy was performed under video-assisted thoracic surgery."
