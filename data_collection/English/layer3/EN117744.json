  "text": "A 60-year-old Caucasian woman had a 10-year history of cystic lung disease and recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces. She was noted to have papular lesions over her face and forehead. The result of a biopsy showed these lesions to be fibrofolliculomas. A diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome was made and she was screened for renal tumors since these are a recognized association. A hybrid oncocytoma was detected which was surgically excised by partial nephrectomy."
