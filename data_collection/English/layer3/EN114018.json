  "text": "A 70-year-old male, who was recently diagnosed with hepatocholangiocarcinoma, was complaining of floaters in his right eye over the past 5 months and was referred to the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre. On presentation, his visual acuity in the right eye was 6/24. Fundus exam revealed a whitish, unilateral, full-thickness retinal lesion at the inferotemporal arcade of his right eye, with vitreous infiltration and subretinal fluid. The patient underwent 25G pars plana vitrectomy with biopsy, resection of the lesion and intravitreal bevacizumab injection. Histopathology testing of the surgical specimens confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma to the eye. Two months postoperatively his visual acuity had improved to 6/7.5 and there was no sign of active disease in his right eye, while 9 months postoperatively his visual acuity decreased to 6/9.5 due to developing nuclear sclerotic cataract in his right eye."
