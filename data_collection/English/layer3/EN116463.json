  "text": "A 33-year-old Indian woman presented with ruptured ectopic pregnancy associated with hemoperitoneum for which she underwent a laparotomy. The diagnosis of bilateral ectopic pregnancies was made during surgery. Salpingectomy was done on one side and the other tube was conserved with salpingostomy. Six months after surgery, she conceived spontaneously and a transvaginal ultrasound examination revealed a 5-weeks live intrauterine pregnancy."
