  "text": "A 21-year-old man who presented with chronic isolated bilateral pinna swelling as a result of leprosy is reported. The bilateral pinna swelling started as multiple shiny papules with an erythematous background and progressively became hyperpigmented and lobular over two years. This rare presentation of leprosy poses initial diagnostic difficulties, leading to misdiagnoses by various health care professionals. Diagnoses ascribed include eczema, insect bite and perichondritis. A suspicion of leprosy was raised when hyperaesthetic hypopigmentation of skin started to appear on the body after two years, with worsening of the pinna swellings. This was confirmed by identification of Mycobacterium leprae in slit skin smear test and skin biopsy."
