  "text": "65-year-old man with HME and extra-articular multi-axial limb deformity was admitted to the orthopedic department due to chronic knee pain and limited range of motion caused by secondary osteoarthritis. Regarding to the clinical and radiological examinations, after preoperative planning he was qualified to a one-stage TKA combined with tibial shaft osteotomy (TSO). In a one year follow-up full bone union was confirmed with no signs of implant loosening or prosthesis displacement. Patient was very satisfied, did not report any joint pain and has sufficient range of motion without knee instability."
