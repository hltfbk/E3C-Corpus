  "text": "We report the case of a 47-year-old male patient involved in a road traffic accident in which he sustained an open distal femoral intra-articular fracture with substantial loss of distal femoral shaft and the entire metaphyseal regions. Reconstruction options considered include osteochondral distal femoral allograft, ilizarov bone transport, free vascularised vascularized fibular graft with/without allograft, arthrodesis, and custom megaprosthesis of the distal femur. Considering all the merits and demerits of the aforementioned options and including patient's expectations in the treatment algorithm, custom megaprosthesis of the knee was designed and implanted. At 18 months follow-up, our patient showed gratifying results with a Musculo-skeletal Tumours Society MSTS score of 26, good articulation of the segments, no somatosensory or motor deficit, no infection, no dislocation, or periprosthetic fracture."
