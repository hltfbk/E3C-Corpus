  "text": "The patient was born to non-consanguineous, healthy parents of Chinese origin. She presented facial anomalies, micrognathia and skull malformations at birth, and was found hearing impairment, congenital heart disease and developmental delay during her first year of life. Her first visit to our center was at 1 year of age due to cardiovascular repair surgery for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and ventricular septal defect (VSD). Skull X-ray showed wormian bones. She returned at 7 years old after she developed progressive skeletal anomalies with fractures. She presented with multiple wormian bones, acro-osteolysis, severe osteoporosis, bowed fibulae and a renal cyst. Positive genetic test of a de novo heterozygous frameshift mutation in exon 34 of NOTCH2 (c.6426dupT) supported the clinical diagnosis of HCS."
