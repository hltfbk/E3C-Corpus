  "text": "A 66-year-old asymptomatic Caucasian male was referred for colonoscopy with a positive faecal occult blood test as part of the UK national bowel cancer screening programme. Relevant past medical history included atrial fibrillation for which he took Dabigatran. He had a normal haemoglobin, mean cell volume, platelet and clotting function. During colonoscopy, an unusual vascular pattern encompassing the entire rectum extending to the rectosigmoid junction was noted at intubation. The lesion demonstrated confluent circumferential purple discolouration indicating venous blood supply, with heaping up of the mucosa involving the entire rectum and rectosigmoid junction. There was no corresponding history of venothromboembolic disease or liver disease. The patient proceeded to have computed tomography (CT) which revealed a considerably thickened rectosigmoid wall with multiple small rounded punctate calcifications within it, and no other visceral involvement. Subsequent magnetic resonance (MR) scan of the pelvis demonstrated extensive diffuse thickening of the rectum and lower sigmoid with intermediate to high T2 signal, and an internal architecture of multiple 'grapelike' lobulations."
