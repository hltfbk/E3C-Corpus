  "text": "We report the case of a 21-year-old Greek Caucasian female rowing athlete who was injured on both thighs. She complained of pain and inability to walk. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the thighs and restriction of knee movement. The result of a roentgenogram was normal, and there was no evidence of fracture or patella displacement. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed haematoma formation in both the rectus femoris muscles. The diameters of the left and right haematomas within the muscles were 6 cm and 5 cm, respectively. Therapeutic approaches included compression bandages, ice application, rest, elevation, and administration of muscle relaxant drugs. Active stretching and isometric exercises were performed after three days. The patient was able to walk using crutches two days after the initiation of treatment. On the seventh day, she had regained her full ability to walk without crutches. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were administered on the fifth day and continued for one week. Six weeks later, she had pain-free function and the result of magnetic resonance imaging was normal. She was able to resume her training programme and two weeks later, she returned to her previous sport activities and competitions."
