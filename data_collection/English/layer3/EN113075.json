  "text": "Here, we present a case of 3-month-old ununited fracture of the medial condyle in an 8-year-old child, treated by osteosynthesis that produced good result. The patient presented to us with valgus instability of elbow and restricted range of motion. Open reduction, freshening of margins, and fixation of the ununited fragment with K-wires were done. Postoperatively, the patient regained functional range of motion and had a stable elbow."
