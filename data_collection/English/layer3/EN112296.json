  "text": "A class II open-bite patient received BTX-A injection to the anterior belly of her digastric muscle for the prevention of post-operative relapse. The relapse was evaluated via a clinical examination and a lateral cephalometric radiograph after the completion of post-surgical orthodontic treatment. The patient showed stable occlusion without any signs of relapse at 15â€‰months post-operatively."
