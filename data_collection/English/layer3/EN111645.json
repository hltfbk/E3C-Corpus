  "text": "A 68-year-old woman underwent SSPPD for ampullary carcinoma. The tumor was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma without lymph node metastasis (T2N0M0, stage IB). Computed tomography (CT) performed 3â€‰years later revealed a 14-mm tumor near the site of the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration showed adenocarcinoma that was morphologically similar to the specimen from the first surgery. We diagnosed recurrence of ampullary carcinoma in the remnant pancreas. A total remnant pancreatectomy was performed. We found a white solid tumor at the 20-mm distal side of pancreaticojejunal anastomosis. The tumor was morphologically similar and immunostaining showed a pattern identical to that of the original tumor, suggesting that the two tumors were of the same origin."
