  "text": "This report describes a case of a 31-year-old Georgian woman with a de novo pathogenic mutation causing oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, who was a volunteer in an oocyte donation program for in vitro fertilization purposes, and the outcome of the treatments of this particular donor's oocyte receivers, describing the implications of the mutation for the children born as a result of the treatments. It raises important medical and ethical issues about the necessity of genetic testing of oocyte donors and the possibility of rare genetic disorders being inherited by the offspring of donors."
