  "text": "A 42-year-old man was admitted to our hospital, Preventive Welfare Clinic, for severe paroxysmal axial myoclonus of the left shoulder and abdominal muscles. The initial diagnosis was \"combination of spinal segmental myoclonus and propriospinal myoclonus\". The myoclonic movements did not occur during sleep but were aggravated by bathing, alcohol drinking, and anger. Psychological examination indicated hostile attribution. Although considered not to be a case of psychogenic myoclonus, a \"psychogenic factor\" was definitely involved in the induction of the organic myoclonus. The final diagnosis was \"combination of spinal segmental myoclonus and propriospinal myoclonus accompanied by features of psychosomatic disorders\". The patient underwent psychosomatic therapy including AT and surface electromyography (EMG)-biofeedback therapy and treatment with clonazepam and carbamazepine."
