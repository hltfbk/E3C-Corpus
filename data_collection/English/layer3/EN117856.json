  "text": "A 79-year-old woman presented with a one-day history of acute onset of right upper abdominal pain. The patient underwent laparotomy with a preoperative diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis with possible gangrene. At laparotomy, the gallbladder was distended, and multiple necrotic areas were observed. It was rotated more than 180 degrees clockwise around the mesentery, and cholecystectomy was performed."
