  "text": "We present a case of rupture of the small anastomotic pseudoaneurysm at the proximal anastomosis of a right iliofemoral autogenous vein extra-anatomic graft in the urinary bladder. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a rupture of an autogenous vein graft in the urinary bladder. Our patient, a 24-year-old Albanian farmer, was admitted to the emergency department in severe hemorrhagic shock induced by exsanguinating hematuria. He underwent immediate surgery, during which direct sutures to the bladder were placed and the saphenous graft was replaced with a synthetic one. The patient recovered completely, was free of hematuria, and showed no signs of pathological communication between the urinary and arterial tracts on postoperative cystoscopy and computed tomographic angiography during 2 years of follow-up."
