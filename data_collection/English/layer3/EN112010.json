  "text": "A 63-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with a history of right lower abdominal mass. The patient underwent laparotomy, which showed an appendiceal mucocele originating from the apex of the appendix, and a simple appendectomy was performed. The subsequent histological assessment identified an LAMN with no lymph node involvement and negative surgical margin. The patient received six cycles of chemotherapy after surgery, and to date, more than a year after the surgery, the patient remains in good health."
