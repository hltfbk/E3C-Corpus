  "text": "We report a Chinese male with successful correction of Type I persistent truncus arteriosus at 33 years of age. He had unilateral pulmonary hypertension from migration of pulmonary artery band from the main to the right pulmonary artery, severe truncal valve regurgitation from previous infective endocarditis, and progressive congestive heart failure. Improvement of lung perfusion was demonstrated 21 months post operation."
