  "text": "We report on a 6-year-old boy whose prime presentation was a waddling gait associated with pain since early childhood. Radiographic documentation showed progressive acetabulo-femoral dysplasia associated with additional skeletal deformities. Laboratory investigations showed increased urinary keratan sulfate and reduced leukocyte enzymatic activity of N-Acetyl-Galaktosamin-6-sulfate-sulfatase. Mucopolysaccharoidosis type IV A (Morquio syndrome) has been identified."
