  "text": "An elderly gentleman of 65 years complained of nose block on both sides for 3 months. On examination, he had firm polypoidal masses arising from the middle meatus and septum on both sides. Computed tomography scan of the sinuses revealed polypoidal mucosal thickening in bilateral sinuses with bilateral concha bullosa. The patient underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery with the complete excision of the masses from the lateral wall and septum under general anesthesia. The results of the histopathological examination showed inflammatory changes in polypoidal tissues from the right maxillary, bilateral ethmoidal sinuses, and bilateral septal masses. The lesion in the left middle meatus showed the features of respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma (READ). The case had no evidence of residual or recurrent lesion during 6 months after the surgery."
