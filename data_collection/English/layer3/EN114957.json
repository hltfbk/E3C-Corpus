  "text": "A 19-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit following a traumatic brain injury. After admission, he underwent a craniotomy for the severe brain injury. However, he developed DI after the operation. Despite treatment with vasopressin, his urine output reached 5-6 L/day as a result of the DI, and his CrCl increased to 180-278 mL/min. We were required to administer 6-7 L of fluid a day to compensate for the high urinary fluid output. On day 55, MRSA pneumonia with sepsis was suspected and, consequently, LZD was administrated intravenously (600 mg every 12 h). He was treated with LZD for 14 days. The patient has since successfully recovered from MRSA pneumonia with concomitant bacteremia, and was transferred to the general ward on day 82. Blood LZD levels from days 60-68, which were measured after the patient's transfer to the general ward, showed that the trough levels were lower than the threshold level of detection. The blood 24-h area under the plasma LZD concentration-time curve (AUC)24/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 69.3."
