  "text": "A 32-year-old Caucasian female exhibited chronic urinary incontinence that commenced at the age of 7 years and remained the unexplained symptom more than two decades before the onset of progressive neurologic decline. A transient growth failure and absent sexual development with hypoprolactinemia appeared in the meanwhile. Neurologic, endocrine, neuroradiologic, and genetic evaluation performed only in the patient's thirties, confirmed the diagnosis of 4H leukodystrophy as the only cause of the micturition disturbance."
