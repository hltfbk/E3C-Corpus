  "text": "Here, we report the case of a 25Â year-old nulliparous patient who presented with a synchronous endometrioid ovarian and endometrial carcinoma. She was able to conduct a full-term spontaneous pregnancy after conservative surgical treatment followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal treatment. Fertility sparing treatment is feasible in selected cases of synchronous ovarian and endometrial cancers. Thorough follow-up remains mandatory."
