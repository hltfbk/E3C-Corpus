  "text": "This report is of a 25-year-old Arabic female patient from the United Arab Emirates, who, during her first pregnancy, developed acinic cell carcinoma of the right parotid gland that was managed with surgical excision in the form of superficial parotidectomy. During her second pregnancy, which occurred four years later, she had a recurrence of the same malignant neoplasm associated with ipsilateral malignant cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient was managed with total parotidectomy and neck dissection, as well as postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy. Our observation on this particular case of acinic cell carcinoma is that the initial onset of her neoplasm was during her first pregnancy, and the recurrence of the same malignant disease was during a subsequent pregnancy. This chronologic association raised our suspicion that there might be a possible etiologic effect of pregnancy or its associated hormonal or physiologic changes or both on the pathogenesis or etiology of acinic cell carcinoma."
