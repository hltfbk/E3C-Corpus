  "text": "A 52-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with acute febrile illness and headache, diagnosed as respiratory infection, central nervous system (CNS) infection, septicemia, and hepatic dysfunction. Based on B. pseudomallei-positive blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures, the patient was diagnosed with melioidosis and treated aggressively with antibiotics. However, the patient failed to make a full recovery. Further laboratory tests focused on CNS infection were conducted. The co-infection of B. pseudomallei and JEV was confirmed after the positive IgM antibodies of JEV were detected in both CSF and blood. After diagnosis of co-infection with B. pseudomallei and JEV, the patient was provided supportive care in hospital and recovered after approximately 3 weeks."
