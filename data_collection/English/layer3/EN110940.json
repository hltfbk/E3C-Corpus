  "text": "A 76-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with HCC measuring 9.5 × 8.0 cm in segments 4, 5, and 8 of the liver. This patient with anti-Ge alloantibody had a history of two pregnancies without transfusion. CH was planned, and based on the suggestion from the multidisciplinary team meeting, preoperative autologous donation (PAD) and acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) were performed. CH was successfully performed by using CUSA and Thunderbeat® with Pringle maneuver and infra-hepatic inferior vena cava clamping without perioperative need for an allogeneic blood transfusion. She has been alive without recurrence after a follow-up period of 45 months."
