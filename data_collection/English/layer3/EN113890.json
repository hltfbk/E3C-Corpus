  "text": "A 54-year-old woman presented with severe pain in the bilateral hip joints and was diagnosed with end-stage osteoarthritis. She underwent THA on the right side. Although the postoperative course was uneventful, she suddenly experienced severe pain and swelling in the right leg without any history of trauma 22 weeks after the surgery. She was first diagnosed with cellulitis by her local doctor and was treated with oral antibiotics. Her symptoms persisted, and she returned to our hospital 1 month later. Her right distal leg and ankle were diffusely swollen and tender. Plain radiographs revealed a sclerotic linear zone in the distal tibia and fibula. She was diagnosed with insufficiency fractures in the distal tibia and fibula following THA. Local disuse osteoporosis and increased mechanical stress after THA as a result of pain relief could be the causes for her fracture. Her right leg and ankle were immobilized with a splint for another 4 weeks. Her symptoms subsided gradually, and fracture union was confirmed on the follow-up X-ray."
