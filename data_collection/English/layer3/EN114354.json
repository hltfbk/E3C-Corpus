  "text": "A middle-aged female presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath and chest pain associated with fever, polyarthritis, and had a chronic polymorphic rash on the back and lower extremities. Blood analysis showed highly elevated inflammatory markers and rheumatoid factor. After ruling out other possible deferential diagnoses and reviewing the medical literature, the patient was diagnosed with Wissler-Fanconi syndrome. A combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids achieved complete remission."
