  "text": "An 11-year-old boy presented to our department with a 12-month history of right-sided nasal obstruction, purulent nasal discharge and posterior rhinorrhea. His medical, surgical and family history was unremarkable. He had no others rhinological symptoms; particularly no epistaxis nor olfactory disorders. Physical examination with nasal endoscopy found a large polypoid mass filling completely the right nasal cavity extending to the nasopharynx leading to a left septal deviation. Cervical examination did not show any lymphadenopathy. The ophtalmological and neurological exams were normal.\nCoronal and axial sinus computerized tomography (CT) revealed a complete filling of the right nasal cavity with choanal, nasopharyngeal and right pansinusal extension associated to a controlateral septal deviation. No bony destruction was observed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an ethmoido-nasal mass extending lateraly to the maxillary sinus with a meatal enlargement and posteriorly to the nasopharynx. The lesion appeared in heteregenous signal with a cerebriform aspect and a peripheral enhancement on T1-weighted-gadolinium sequences. The diagnosis of inflammatory mass or angiectasic polyp were evoked. Biopsies were performed and histopathological analysis concluded to the diagnosis of an inflammatory polyp. The patient underwent an endonasal endoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. A large medial meatotomy were performed and the IP diagnosis was made on frozen sections of peroperative specimen, thus a right medial maxillectomy and an ethmoidectomy were achieved with a complete removal of the tumor. The patient was discharged two days after. Microscopally, the tumor was made of thickened epithelial nests arising from the surface and growing down into the stroma confiming the enodophytic growth related to the IP. There was no recurrence after six months of follow-up."
