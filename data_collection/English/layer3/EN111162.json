  "text": "A 36-year-old cachexic man with no significant past medical history was transferred to our hospital with a history of painless jaundice, elevated blood glucose and significant weight loss. Lab tests showed elevated serum transaminases, bilirubin and alpha-fetoprotein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging of the upper abdomen showed a diffusely enlarged pancreas, appearing \"sausage-shaped\". Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed upstream ductal dilation secondary to stricture of the main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct, which were not visible. Immunohistochemistry of biopsied tissue from a percutaneous pancreatic biopsy showed tumor cell positivity for HepPar1, polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen and CK19, suggestive of HC of the pancreas. The characteristics of 39 patients with HC of the pancreas were reviewed."
