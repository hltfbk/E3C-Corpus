  "text": "A 78-year-old Caucasian woman was referred by her dentist to our outpatient clinic with a 4-week history of an oral ulceration after using an antidepressant (sertraline hydrochloride). On the basis of the clinical findings and anamnesis, the occurrence of the lesion was attributed to the use of the drug. Exfoliative cytology was performed, to reassure the patient that it was not oral cancer, which revealed the presence of a nonspecific inflammatory reaction. The drug was replaced and resolution of symptoms was observed."
