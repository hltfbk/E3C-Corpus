  "text": "Our case was a 26-year-old primigravid woman at 35â€‰weeks gestation. She presented to Guangzhou First People's Hospital with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. The second day after admission, she complained of more intense abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting and abdominal distention that were out of proportion to physical signs. An emergency exploratory laparotomy was performed. The entire ileum, part of the jejunum and part of the ascending colon were gangrenous, and thromboembolism was discovered in the corresponding mesenteric veins. The necrotic intestine was resected and an end-to-end jejunum-colon anastomosis was performed. A cesarean section was performed to remove the placenta and fetus, which had expired. Histopathological analysis revealed extensive edema, hemorrhage, inflammatory infiltration and necrosis in the resected bowel, and widespread thrombosis in mesenteric venous lumens."
