  "text": "We describe the clinical features of 2 patients (one with osteochondroma and one with HME) evaluated before and after GH therapy. In the first patient, the single osteochondroma was noticed after the start of treatment; the other patient showed no evidence of significant increase in size or number of lesions related to GH therapy."
