  "text": "A 22 year-old female patient with translocation type mRCC, who previously had been treated for nearly 5 years, became pregnant during the treatment break period. Follow-up examinations revealed a dramatic clinical and radiological progression of mRCC in a few weeks therefore the pregnancy was terminated. A few days after surgical abortion, CT examination showed a significant spontaneous regression of the pulmonary metastases, and the volume of the largest manifestation decreased from ca. 30 to 3.5 cm(3) in a week. To understand the possible mechanism of this spectacular regression, estrogen, progesterone and luteinizing hormone receptors (ER, PGR and LHR, respectively) immuno-histochemistry assays were performed on the original surgery samples. Immuno-histochemistry showed negative ER, PGR and positive LHR status suggesting the possible angiogenic effect of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (hCG) in the background."
