  "text": "Herein, we describe a pair of monozygotic twins presenting with severe intellectual disability, distinct facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, and increased alkaline phosphatase level. Two individuals underwent whole exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing to confirm the co-segregation of the mutation in the consanguineous family. A biallelic loss of function mutation in PGAP3 was detected. Both patients were homozygous for the c.203delC (p.C68LfsX88) mutation and the parents were carriers confirming the founder effect of the mutation. High ALP serum levels confirmed the molecular diagnosis."
