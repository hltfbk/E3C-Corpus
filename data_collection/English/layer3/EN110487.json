  "text": "A 12-year old child consults for febrile torticollis, without alteration of the general condition, and the evolution was for three weeks. The medical history of the patient does not find any pathological history, and he was well vaccinated. There was no tuberculosis notion of contagion. Physical exam found torticollis with mild pain in palpation in the lower cervical spine, while there were no swell and the temperature was 38~38.5Â°, we noted a biological inflammatory syndrome (WB: 16,000 mg/L; SR: 70 mg/L; CRP: 200 mg/L). The tuberculin skin test was positive, and search of tuberculosis (TB) in sputum and urine was negative. X-ray of the cervical spine was normal. More investigation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was done and showed: signal abnormality of the cancellous bone of the posterior arch of C7 and D1, extended to the back of the vertebral body such as hyposignal in T1, a discreet hyper signal in T2, taking contrast after gadolinium injection. This signal abnormality is associated with posterior unilamellar periosteal reaction of the side of the left vertebral lamina and linear hypo signal T1 of the cortical endo canal of the posterior arch of D1 and C7 with the presence of some small erosion. The diagnosis was in favor of a specific infection, a radiological biopsy was not able for a technical reason, so we decided to do a surgical biopsy. In per operative, we found a collection in the interspinous space. The histological exam confirmed tuberculosis disease. The patient had tuberculosis chemotherapy for 12 months and immobilization with minerva. At the follow up of 3 years, we note a full motion of the cervical spine without any pain or any sign of recurrence."
