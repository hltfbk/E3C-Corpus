  "text": "A 45-year-old man who had previously undergone UGI panendoscopy and colonoscopy during a voluntary health check-up at our facility was admitted to the emergency room (ER) at the same facility due to persistent epigastric pain with radiation to the back. At the ER, the patient did not present notable abnormalities upon physical, conscious, or laboratory examinations apart from mild tenderness in the epigastric abdomen. Acute abdominal aortic dissection was suspected, and abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed SMAD. He was then transferred to the cardiovascular ward and treated conservatively with fasting, prostaglandin E1, and aspirin. The patient recovered and returned home soon after, and was symptom-free 6 months after discharge from the facility."
