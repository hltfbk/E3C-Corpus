  "text": "Case 1 : a 24-year-old female was referred to ANAKO Mother and Child Medical Centre on the 07/12/2019 from a 280km locality for better management of a large swelling on the right labia. Three days prior to arrival (05/12/2018), she noticed gradual onset, painful and progressive swelling on the right side of her vulva. The swelling started 5 hours following coitus with her usual partner. She denied aggression, coercion, instrumentation with other objects or use of drugs by her partner during or prior to coitus. She had no history of easy bruising or excessive bleeding after trauma. The patient went to a nearby health facility where she was hospitalized. She was conservatively managed with antibiotics and transfused 450cc of whole blood. Progress was marked by intermittent bleeding and an increase in the size of the swelling. An increase in the intensity of the pain prompted a referral to our health facility.\nShe was G2P1011. She terminated a pregnancy at 8 weeks, 3 years earlier. A live vaginal birth 15months earlier with neither vaginal nor perineal tears. Menarche was at 14 years; she bleeds for 5 days and has a regular cycle of 30 days.\nOn examination, the patient was alert. Her blood pressure was 126/78 mmHg, heart rate was 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute and her temperature was 36.5ºC. She had mild pallor. On palpation of her abdomen, no tenderness, guarding, or rebound was elicited. At the perineum, there was a large swelling on the right labia majora, measuring 7x6 cm, necrotic, tender and tense, a vaginal examination was not possible. A pelvic (transabdominal) ultrasound was done which showed pelvic organs in place and a hematoma thus eliminating a uterine prolapse. A full blood count was done which revealed a normocytic normochromic anaemia at 9g/dl. Platelets were normal.\nVaginal examination/exploration and debridement were done under local anaesthesia and a packed dressing was done. No further bleeding was noted after this. She was given the following medications, antibiotics; ceftriaxone 1g every 12 hours, metronidazole 500mg every 08 hours and gentamycin 80mg every 12 hours, analgesics: paracetamol 1000mg, 08 hourly. She was also supplemented with iron tablets, 80mg/day. Sitz baths were started and done 12 hourly and polyvidone iodine. She was discharged on day three post admission and continued with polyvidone iodine ovules and sitz baths. Subsequent follow up was unremarkable. Case 2 : a 17-year-old female presented to our emergency room on the 01/12/2018 with pain and swelling on the left labia majora. It started 3 hours before arrival. She noticed a rapidly increasing swelling which was extremely tender and tense on the left side of the vulva. She was unable to stand or sit and the pain was not relieved by painkillers, paracetamol and diclofenac. There was no history of coitus in the last 3 days and she had shaved the previous day. She had no history of easy bruising or excessive bleeding after trauma.\nShe is G1P1 and mother to 7-month-old infant.\nOn arrival, she was in pains. Her blood pressure was 130/87 mmHg, a pulse of 78 beats per minute and temperature was 37.2ºC. Conjunctivae were pink and sclera anicteric.\nThere was a large swelling on left labia majora 9x7 cm, tense, tender with no skin discoloration. The swelling ruptured spontaneously and we drained about 500cc of clotted blood. The wound was packed and there was no further bleeding until 12 hours later when the dressing was removed. She received prophylactic antibiotics; ceftriaxone 2g before debridement and had fluids, normal saline and ringers lactate, 500cc 12 hourly for 24 hours. The patient was discharged two days later with polyvidone iodine ovules and sitz baths."
