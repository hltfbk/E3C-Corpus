  "text": "A 63-year-old man presented with persistent, gradually aggravating headaches over a period of two months. They were continuous holocranial headaches evolving in a context of impaired general performance status. Subsequently, the patient presented again three weeks later with morning vomiting and complaining of blurred vision. The patient reported having been febrile for the preceding two months. His past medical history was unremarkable and he was not currently on medication. He was then admitted to the hospital of Tunis in September 2018 for an exploration of chronic febrile illness and headaches. The physical examination recorded a temperature of 38.5°C. The neurological exam showed a conscious patient well oriented in space and time who had neither meningeal nor vestibular syndrome. A bilateral paralysis of the sixth cranial nerve was found associated with bilateral hypo-acousia. However, he had no sensori-motor deficit and no neurological localizing signs. An eye fundus revealed a bilateral stage I papilledema. All others clinical examinations were normal. A basic metabolic panel revealed several abnormalities: an elevated C-reactive protein, lymphopenia, hyper-fibrinogenemia, and anemia (Table 1). A cerebral computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed normal findings. However, an audiogram showed bilateral perceptive deafness. A lumbar puncture revealed an opening cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure of 350mm of water, protein 0.69 g/L, glucose 0.3mmol/L, and WBC of 60x10 6 /L (80% lymphocytes). An India ink stain was positive for Cryptococcus. CSF and serum cryptococcal antigen tests also returned positive (with titers of 1:10000 and 1:1000 respectively). Blood and CSF culture were positive and revealed the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans. The antifungal sensitivity test was also performed (Table 1). Therefore, a diagnosis of Cryptococcus meningoencephalitis was established. The search for a cause of immunodeficiency that would explain this opportunistic infection, in a seemingly immuno-competent patient, was initiated. The serological testing for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were negative (CD4/CD8 ratio was 1.5). Serum protein electrophoresis revealed hypo-albuminemia 23.7 g/l (normal range: 37.7-45.6 g/l) with hypogammaglobulinemia 4.5g/l (normal range:6.4-12.7g/l). Immunofixation electrophoresis detected monoclonal IgA-lambda (IgA-λ) paraproteinemia at 0.6 g/l. The urine immunofixation revealed the presence of Bence Jones proteinuria type light chain lambda at 0.4 g/l. The serum level of IgA, IgG, and IgM concentrations were measured at 4.04 g/l (normal range: 0.80-3.1), 5.4 (normal range 6.5-15), and 0.45 g/l (normal range: 0.55-3.0) respectively. Quantitative evaluation of the free light chains showed excessively high lambda (λ) chains at 183.14 mg/L (normal range: 5.71-26.3 mg/L) and kappa (κ) chains at 9.47 mg/L (normal range: 3.3-19.4 mg/L) with a κ/λ free light chain ratio of < 0.1 (normal range: 0.26-1.65). May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained bone marrow aspirate smears revealed an infiltration of 12% malignant plasma cells with atypically formed and partly bi-or multi-nucleated cells. The β2-microglobulin was elevated at 3.82 mg/L (normal range: 0.8-3 mg/L). Based on these findings, consistent with the International Myeloma Working Group diagnostic criteria, a diagnosis of IgA-λ multiple myeloma was determined. The patient was treated for the Cryptococcal infection with amphotericin B at 0.7 mg/kg/day concurrently with flucytosine at 100 mg/kg/day. Repeated CSF drainage was established to reduce CSF pressure. The induction treatment lasted 21 days, after which the CSF fungi culture became negative and the cryptococcal antigen test in serum and CSF both showed a decrease in antigen titers to 1:10. He was then transitioned to oral fluconazole at 800 mg/day for 12 weeks. Upon the second week of consolidation treatment for the infection, the patient's treatment for IgA lambda type multiple myeloma was initiated with a chemotherapy regimen based on thalidomide, melphalan, and prednisone. The evolution was good without complication. No clinical or imaging examination evidence of neurologic complications was found during nine months after this episode."
