  "text": "A 61-year-old woman was admitted to the local hospital for septic shock with diabetic ketoacidosis due to necrotizing fasciitis of the right thigh. Three days later, she had hematemesis, and gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed black mucosal coloration throughout the entire esophagus. She was diagnosed as having AEN. Her general condition improved after intensive care, debridement, and treatment with antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor; the esophageal mucosal color recovered. However, an esophageal stricture developed after 1 month, and the patient underwent gastrostomy to remove an esophageal obstruction after 3 months. She was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment 1 year and 4 months after the occurrence of AEN because of her strong desire for oral intake. Her medical condition was poor, and she could not walk due to generalized muscle weakness. After rehabilitation for 8 months, we performed an esophageal bypass using a gastric conduit via the percutaneous route rather than esophagectomy because of her multiple severe comorbidities including walking difficulty, chronic hepatitis C, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic renal failure. Minor leakage of the esophagogastrostomy occurred and was resolved with conservative treatment. The patient began oral intake on postoperative day 34 and was discharged on day 52."
