  "text": "A 27 month old girl with developmental delay, central hypotonia, cerebral atrophy, and failure to thrive with growth retardation was identified by whole exome sequencing to have a mosaic missense variant in SLC35A2 (c.991G > A). This particular variant has been previously reported in a male as a mutation. Comparison of all clinical findings and new information on growth pattern, growth hormone testing and neurodevelopmental evaluation are detailed on the patient presented."
