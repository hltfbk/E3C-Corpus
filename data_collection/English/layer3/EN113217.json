  "text": "A 73-year-old man on PD presented with progressive worsening of abdominal pain and cloudy peritoneal fluid. The peritoneal fluid cell count was increased to 980/ml and peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis was diagnosed. Computed tomography showed local adhesions causing agglomeration of the dilated intestine. He initially responded to antibiotic treatment; however, his abdominal pain was rapidly worsened after resumption of oral intake. On hospital day 23, computed tomography showed loss of contents from the dilated intestine and discharge of fecal material from the PD tube was noted. Thus, small bowel perforation was diagnosed, and he underwent ileocecal resection with colostomy creation. As indicators of EPS was not evident, PD catheter was removed. Since then, he has been on maintenance of hemodialysis since then."
