  "text": "A 62 years old male presented with chief complaints of multiple openings with faecal discharge in the right groin for last 20 days with no history of constipation, trauma, and urinary or other abdominal complaints. CT scan revealed a small gut loop communicating with anterior abdominal wall. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a loop of distal ileum adherent to the internal inguinal ring which was retrieved back into the abdominal cavity. There was perforation over the loop. Resection of the segment of ileum involved was done with ileo-ileal hand sewn anastomosis and the internal inguinal ring was closed from inside of the peritoneal cavity. The openings in the skin over the inguinal region were communicated with each other and laid open due to cellulitis of the area involved and pus discharge."
