  "text": "A 43-year-old male admitted to the emergency department with severe pain in both shoulders and immobility. He was lying on the floor, suddenly he tried to stand up, shoulders in extension, abduction and external rotation. The patient reported two similar accidents in his history, but no surgery, no epilepsy nor hypoglycemia. Physical examination revealed a symmetric deformity with arms held in slight abduction and external rotation, a hollow beneath the acromion and bilateral anterior bulge. Vascular and neurological examinations were normal in both upper limbs. The anteroposterior radiographs in the plane of the scapula confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation without associated fractures. A closed reduction by Milch maneuver was performed under sedation, no neurovascular deficit was detected post reduction. Control x-ray showed anatomical reduction without iatrogenic fracture. Both shoulders were immobilized in arm slings for 3 weeks. The patient was referred to the rehabilitation department, after 4 weeks post injury, he recovered a normal range of motion in both shoulders without pain, but he still complained of right shoulder instability with subluxation episodes; therefore, it was decided to stabilize the wright shoulder by open Latarjet technique. Passive mobilization was started immediately during the 2 days of hospitalization, followed by assistive and active mobilization in the rehabilitation department. Active abduction with external rotation of the right shoulder weren't permitted for 6 weeks after surgery. At follow-up, 6-month post-injury the patient was able to move both shoulder normally, without limitation, pain, or instability."
