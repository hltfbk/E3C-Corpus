  "text": "Here we report the case of a 25-year-old man who underwent onco-TESE from his residual single testis with a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor that occurred 5 years after orchiectomy of the contralateral testis. A second orchiectomy and simultaneous TESE from the noncancerous testicular tissue were performed. The pathological diagnosis was germ cell tumors, tumors of more than one histological type (embryonal carcinoma, immature teratoma, yolk sac tumor, seminoma, and choriocarcinoma; pT1N0M0). The patient subsequently married and hoped for fatherhood 3 years later. Whereas histological diagnosis of the normal testicular tissue was Johnsen score 6 (maturation arrest), morphologically normal and motile sperms were successfully retrieved from thawed TESE samples and used for multiple cycles of intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Although the conception has not been succeeded to date, ICSI attempts have been continuing."
