  "text": "We present a case of an incomplete discoid lateral meniscus of the right knee in an 11 year-old boy, treated with arthroscopic partial resection, which developed a re-growth of the remnant, restoring the pre-operative incomplete discoid shape. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report about re-growth of a discoid meniscus after surgery. Debate still exists regarding the etiology of a discoid meniscus. Some authors proposed it is the persistence of the normal stage during fetal development. However, most other authors believe it is anomalous and arises through variant morphogenesis. The re-growth of the discoid lateral meniscus following surgery in this patient seems to prove this latter theory. The residual growth of the knee involves also the lateral meniscus and that may have contributed to restoring the meniscus to the previous condition."
