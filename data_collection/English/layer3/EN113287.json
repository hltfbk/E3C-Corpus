  "text": "A 57-year-old female patient presented with heavy vaginal bleeding. She underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma that was diagnosed preoperatively through dilation and curettage. Full histopathological examination of the uterine specimen revealed carcinosarcoma confined to a 4â€‰cm endometrial polyp in addition to a stage IA endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma which arose from a distinct uterine wall."
