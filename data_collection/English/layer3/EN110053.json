  "text": "A 40-year old non-smoking woman was followed since august 2005 at the National Institute of Oncology in Rabat, for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. It was classified stage IIB according to FIGO classification. Initial treatment consisted of concurrent chemoradiation with 46 grays to the pelvis and weekly platinium based chemotherapy. She was followed every three months with clinical examination, abdominal ultrasound and chest radiograph without any signs of reccurence. She presented on September 2008 with right chest pain without fever, hemoptysis or weight loss. Clinical investigation showed a cavitary lung lesion on CT with a thin walled cavity of 29 mm and wall < 1, 5 mm. Antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was conducted 15 days with poor outcome. Then antibacillary treatment was started with no proof of mycobacterial infection (tuberculin skin test 12 mm, negative sputum culture). A month later the patient presented with leucorrhea and metrorrhagia associated with pneumothorax that required a placement of intercostals chest drain. Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy of the cavitary mass in the right lower lobe was performed. Pathology demonstrated a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical examination found a pelvic mass that was confirmed by MRI showing a subsequent local recurrence. On February 2009, the patient underwent 3 courses of systemic chemotherapy with ciplatin 50 mg/m 2 every three weeks, with acceptable side effects; no improvement in thoracic symptoms was noticed under treatment. She died on June 2009 due to progressive disease."
