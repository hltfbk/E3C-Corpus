  "text": "We report here a girl without a positive family history, who grew oral and fingertip MP at her age of 2 and got abdomen dull pain from 7 years old. Endoscopy revealed no obvious polyps in the stomach or the colon until 10 years old, when she received enteroscopy. Tens of polyps were resected during enteroscopy, and pathological examination confirmed them hamartomas. A heterozygous deletion in STK11, c.471_472delCT, was detected in the proband but not in her parents, which is not recorded in databases."
