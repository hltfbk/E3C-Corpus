  "text": "We present the case of a 47-year-old male patient with a huge right hepatic mass and an estimated insufficient residual liver, who was successfully treated with ALPPS surgery and apatinib. Postoperative pathology revealed HCC with several significant microvascular embolisms. Twenty months after operation, no tumor reoccurrence was observed."
