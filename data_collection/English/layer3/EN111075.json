  "text": "The patient was a 79-year-old Japanese man who visited a previous physician for positive fecal occult blood. Upon close inspection, the preoperative diagnosis was cT2N0M0 stage I. We performed surgery using Senhance. The operation time was 198 min, and the estimated amount of bleeding was 10 g. He was discharged after surgery without any major complications. However, it is also true that the operability of the conventional port arrangement was poor during the surgical operation."
