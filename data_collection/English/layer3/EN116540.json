  "text": "A 36-year-old Asian woman was referred complaining of an abdominal tumor. She had no history of familial adenomatous polyposis, abdominal surgery, trauma or pregnancy. A laparoscopy-assisted right hemicolectomy with a minilaparotomy was conducted for resection of her right-side colon and the anterior wall of her duodenum. The histopathological diagnosis was a desmoid tumor that grew from the transverse mesocolon. Mutational analysis indicated a mutation of the Î²-catenin gene (CTNNB1), consisting of a substitution of threonine for alanine at codon 41. The patient has been followed postoperatively for more than 3 years without any sign of recurrence."
