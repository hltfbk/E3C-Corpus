  "text": "We reported a case of a sixteen-year-old male patient who had suffered from pain and swelling in the biopsy site for two months. His physical examination presented serious stiffness and multiple bony masses in the body, with his bilateral halluces characterized by hallux valgus deformity and macrodactyly. Imaging examinations showed widespread heterotopic ossification. All laboratory blood tests were normal except for the one on alkaline phosphatase. A de novo heterozygous mutation (c.617G > A; p.R206H) were found in the ACVR1/ALK2 using gene sequencing."
