  "text": "A 17-year-old female sustained a Gustilo-Anderson type IIIB open tibia fracture with segmental bone loss after a motor vehicle collision. While amputation seemed inevitable, her extremity was able to be salvaged using the staged induced membrane technique and free flap coverage. She made an exceptional recovery and at 24-month follow-up, her short form-12 scores and foot and ankle outcome scores were close to the average for a healthy adult."
