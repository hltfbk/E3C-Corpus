  "text": "A 20 years old girl presented with a red and farm nodule since 2 years in her right scapular region; a first simple excision was performed and was in favor of a benign lesion (fibrous histiocytoma). The lesion recurred clinically six months later as two farms painless nodules and a solid plaque measuring 3.5cm in diameter. There was no lymphadenopathy. The rereading of the histopathological slides made the diagnosis of superficial subcutaneous epithelioid sarcoma and a chest and abdominal computed tomography ruled out metastasis. Wide excision with surgical margins of 4 cm was performed taking the deep fascial plane. The histological examination confirmed the diagnosis with complete resection limits. In immunohistochemical staining, the tumor cells were immunoreactive for vimentin and epithelial markers (cytokeratin, CD34). The loss of substance left in granulation for a few days, was grafted by thin skin. There was no recurrence or metastasis at eighteen months of follow-up."
