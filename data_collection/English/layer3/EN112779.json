  "text": "We present the case of a 13-year-old lacrosse player with a history of CECS who developed unprovoked acute compartment syndrome. Despite emergent fasciotomy, she experienced intermittent episodes of peroneal nerve deficits. A peroneal nerve neurolysis was later performed which resulted in full resolution of her symptoms."
