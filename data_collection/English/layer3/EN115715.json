  "text": "Here we report the case of a 13-year-old boy, student with history of RTA presented with pain and swelling of distal forearm diagnosed with closed injury of Galeazzi equivalent type. Here injury to the distal ulnar epiphyseal plate is in the form of epiphyseal separation (Salter Harris type I / Peterson type III) with splitting of epiphysis into two fragment - [ulnar styloid & radial side of ulnar epiphyseal plate] (Salter Harris type III / Peterson type IV) with fracture of metaphysis of lower end radius (Peterson type I) without neurovascular deficit. Patient was given surgical treatment in the form of closed reduction and K-wire fixation for fracture of distal radius and open reduction using extended ulnar approach and fixation with K-wire for ulnar epiphyseal fracture as closed reduction was not possible due to soft tissue interposition."
