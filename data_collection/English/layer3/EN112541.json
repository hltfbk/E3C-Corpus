  "text": "A 57-year-old man presented with multiple lymph node metastasis, liver metastasis, and bone metastasis that occurred after the primary resection of the duodenal NET G2. His long-term survival was obtained; the duration of stable disease exceeded 1 year and 6 months following STZ monotherapy. In addition, his CA 19-9 levels, which previously were increasing, normalized following treatment."
