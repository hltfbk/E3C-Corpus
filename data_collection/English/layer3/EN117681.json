  "text": "A 63-year-old patient, diagnosed Fuch's endothelial dystrophy in both eyes underwent a penetrating keratoplasty in his right eye. He had multiple underlying medical problems, which included diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypoadrenalism on oral dexamethasone and fatty liver secondary to hypertrigliseridemia. He developed multiple suture abscesses, corneal haziness, retrocorneal white plaques and a level of hypopyon two weeks after an uneventful penetrating keratoplasty in his right eye. Cultures of the donor button and the transport media culture were negative. Candida glabrata was isolated successfully from the aqueous and vitreous taps. He was treated with a combination of topical, intracameral, intravitreal and intravenous Amphotericin B. His final visual acuity remained poor due to the haziness of the corneal button."
