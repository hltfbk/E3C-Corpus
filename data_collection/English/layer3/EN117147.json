  "text": "We report a case of a healthy 35-year-old woman presenting with altered mental status. Due to suspicion of herpes encephalitis, a CSF PCR for herpes virus was sent for examination and acyclovir was started. The patient had an immediate response to acyclovir; however, when the PCR returned negative she was discharged without therapy. The altered mental status returned and she was started on acyclovir therapy and a second CSF PCR sample was sent and was again negative. MRI performed at initial hospitalization was negative, but a repeat MRI demonstrated bilateral temporal lobe involvement suggestive of herpes encephalitis. The patient was successfully treated for 21 days with acyclovir."
