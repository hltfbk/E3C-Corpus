  "text": "A 64-year-old Japanese male received a living ABO-incompatible kidney transplant from his wife. The postoperative clinical course was normal, and the patient was discharged 21 days after the transplantation with a serum creatinine level of 0.78 mg/dl. The patient frequently complained of general fatigue and fever of unknown origin. Six months later, the patient presented with continuous general fatigue, macroscopic hematuria, and fever. Cystoscopic examination of the bladder showed an edematous region with bleeding, and a transurethral biopsy revealed amyloid deposits. His wife stated that the patient had a recurrent high fever since the age of 40 years and that his younger brother was suspected to have a familial autoinflammatory syndrome; thus, the patient was also suspected to have a familial autoinflammatory syndrome. Based on his brother's medical history and the genetic tests, which showed a homozygous mutation (M694V/M694V) for the Mediterranean fever protein, he was diagnosed with FMF. Although colchicine treatment for FMF was planned, the patient had an untimely death due to heart failure. We re-evaluated the pathological findings of the various tissue biopsies obtained during the treatment after the renal transplantation. Immunohistochemistry revealed amyloid deposits in the bladder region, renal allograft, and myocardium and the condition was diagnosed as AA amyloidosis associated with FMF."
