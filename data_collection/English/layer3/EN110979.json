  "text": "Herein we report a case of a 44-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital due to 20 years of repeated episodes of heart palpitations, 2 years of shortness of breath after activity, and the symptoms were aggravated for 1 month. He had history of inferior myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation. Color Doppler echocardiography revealed rheumatic heart disease, severe mitral regurgitation, mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension. Coronary angiography revealed 60-85% diffuse stenosis in the middle of left anterior descending artery, 60-90% diffuse stenosis in the middle of left circumflex artery, 30-40% diffuse stenosis in the proximal segment of right coronary artery, and WCA anomaly in the middle, and distal segments of right coronary artery."
