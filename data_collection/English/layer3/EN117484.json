  "text": "A 35-year-old Caucasian man presented to hospital with a history of acute urinary retention. On examination he was found to have right testicular enlargement with raised β-human chorionic gonadotrophin, serum α-fetoprotein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. He underwent radical left inguinal orchidectomy and histology confirmed a nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testes. Cystoscopy carried out due to urinary retention showed penile metastasis and the biopsy confirmed metastatic malignant undifferentiated teratoma. Staging computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis showed pulmonary, pelvic nodal, ischial and penile metastasis. The diagnosis of the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group of poor prognosis metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell tumor was made, following which he received four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy with curative intent. He had a complete marker and an excellent radiological response. He is currently under follow up."
