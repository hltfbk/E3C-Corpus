  "text": "We report the rare case of an undiagnosed bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation in an epileptic young man of 25 years of age. The way of treatment is described as well as the treating alterations, if needed, because of the 3 weeks delay from injury. The article focuses on the reasons of the non-diagnosis at the first place and proposes a possible explanation for the mechanism of the injury. This is the second documented case of a missed bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation following a seizure and the first one that was treated not earlier than 3 weeks post injury."
