  "text": "Herein, we present a 48-year-old female patient who presented with an isolated painless lump in her right axilla. Initially, her workup, looking for possible breast cancer, included fine-needle aspiration (FNA) which did not provide the diagnosis. Core-needle biopsy, performed later, revealed monophasic synovial sarcoma. Her workup studies revealed no metastasis. Then, through extensile deltopectoral approach, the tumor was dissected out from within the brachial plexus. Ulnar nerve was sacrificed in order not to compromise the surgical margins which were confirmed tumor free by final pathology. The patient did not receive chemotherapy or radiation upon consultations with medical and radiation oncology teams. Her follow-up revealed no tumor recurrence with no restriction of her right shoulder motion."
