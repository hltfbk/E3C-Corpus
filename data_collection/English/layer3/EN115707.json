  "text": "It is a case report of a 25 years old male presented to us in out-patient department with chief complaint of discharging wounds over mid part of left arm since six months. Clinically provisional diagnosis of chronic osteomylitis of left humerus made and his x-ray sought. X- Ray showed geographic appearance of myositis ossificans around the upper two third of left arm. Sinuses curetted and infected bone (part of myositis ossificans) removed and sent for biopsy. Now the patient is discharge and sinus free, and has resumed his work."
