  "text": "A 55-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on 26 January 2007 with dyspnea, abdominal distention and oliguria. Abdominocentesis revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis resulting from abdominal recurrence from lung cancer. To alleviate the dyspnea and abdominal distention, we drained the ascites aseptically and infused them intravenously back into the patient after removal of tumor cells by centrifugation, and then concentration by apheresis. After the drainage of ascites, we intraperitoneally infused activated killer cells and dendritic cells from the patient's tumor-draining lymph nodes, together with 4.5 x 105U interleukin-2 in 50 ml saline by 2.1 ml/hour infuser balloon.Drastic decreases in the tumor cell count and in ascite retention were observed after several courses of ascites drainage, intravenous infusion and intraperitoneal immunotherapy. The plasma protein level was maintained during the treatment notwithstanding the repeated drainage of ascites. Cell surface marker analysis, cytotoxic activities against autologous tumor cells and interferon-gamma examination of ascites suggested the possibility that these effects were mediated by immunological responses of activated killer cells and dendritic cells infused intraperitoneally."
