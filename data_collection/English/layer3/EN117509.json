  "text": "Three Japanese patients (two women aged 73 and 66 years, and one man aged 27 years) presented with loss of vision (for five months, several months, and two months respectively) and pain on eye movement in the third case only, and were diagnosed as having idiopathic optic perineuritis. Fat-suppressed T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showed high signal intensity areas around the affected optic nerves, suggesting the presence of optic perineuritis. Two patients received steroid pulse therapy and the third was given high-dose steroid therapy. The visual acuity improved in all three cases."
