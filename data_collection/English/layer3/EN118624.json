  "text": "A 2 month old Saudi Arabian male infant was admitted in the pediatric ward of maternity and children's hospital, Buraidah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the management of multiple ulcers on his face, two ulcers were big and were surrounded by edema, causing severe disfigurement. This disfigurement caused difficulty in recognizing the facial feature of Down syndrome. The presence of hypotonia, microcephaly, low set ears, bilateral simian creases and wide separation between big toe and other toes directed us to request karyotyping. The result of karyotyping confirmed the diagnosis of Down syndrome."
