  "text": "We describe the case of a 33-year-old Caucasian man who presented with a 3-month history of general symptoms and who was admitted to our pulmonology ward with dyspnea due to pneumonia and severe anemia. A histopathological examination of an enlarged right suprasternal lymph node confirmed a diagnosis of T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma, an uncommon morphological variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Our patient had a complete response to first-line rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, but had an early relapse 5 months after the end of treatment. After intensive salvage therapy consolidated with an autologous stem-cell transplant, our patient again had an early relapse and was subsequently enrolled in a phase IIa trial of single-agent MOR208. Following a scheduled 3 months of weekly treatment, a partial response was confirmed and MOR208 was continued as maintenance therapy, with administration every second week. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography confirmed a complete response 9 months later. This response is ongoing, with a duration of 24 months. MOR208 was well-tolerated by our patient and his quality of life and performance status remain high. No hospitalizations were required and our patient engaged in full-time work and physical activities."
