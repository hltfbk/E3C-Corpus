  "text": "The patient who was a 16 month old boy was seen in our out-patient clinic on account of multiple congenital anomalies which were noticed at birth. His mother also complained of his inability to open his mouth wide when crying or feeding. His parents were not blood related. He was the fifth child of his mother, and there was no family history of the birth of a child with a congenital anomaly. His pregnancy birth and neonatal history were uneventful. On examination, he was irritable, afebrile, anicteric, acyanosed, normotonic and not in any obvious respiratory distress. His pulse rate was 118 per minute, which was regular and of normal volume. Heart sounds 1 and 2 were heard on auscultation, with no murmurs. He had clear lung fields with good air entry bilaterally. There were no significant findings on abdominal examination, and he had normal external male genitalia. A facial examination showed he had a coarse facial appearance with a flat nasal bridge, hypertelorism, low set microtic ears with protruding ear lobules and a short upturned nose. He had an inter-incisal distance of about 13mm at maximal mouth opening. He had a back swelling measuring about 15cm by 25cm in the lower sacral region, which was sessile, not tender and had no differential warmth. It had an irregular surface, it was soft and had none distinct edges. The swelling had no underlying bony defect, and no pelvic extension was noted on digital rectal examination. His limbs were normal and his serum alpha-fetoprotein level was 31mcg/L (normal 0-5mcg/L). A two dimensional transthoracic echocardiography was done, which showed situs solitus of the atria and viscera, with atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial concordance. The mitral, tricuspid, pulmonary and aortic valves were normal, and chamber walls showed good contractility. There was no atrial septal defect (ASD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) nor ventricular septal defect (VSD) seen. A thick band of echogenic tissue separating the right atrium into 2 unequal halves with a wide eccentric aperture communicating both chambers was seen. Abdomino-pelvic ultrsonography showed normal right and left kidneys. Based on his clinical features and investigation results, a diagnosis of Schinzel-Giedion syndrome with sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) and an asymptomatic cor-triatriatum dexter was made. Genetic analysis was however not done in this patient, as we currently do not have facilities for such a test in our hospital. Due to the documented risk of malignancy in embryonic tumors in SGS [2, 3, 6], a decision for an early excision of the sacrococcygeal mass was made. At induction of anaesthesia, difficulties were encountered at attempts to pass an endotracheal tube due to the inability to open the patientâ€™s mouth wide enough for the placement of a laryngoscope. Bilateral congenital temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis was diagnosed, and attempts at endotracheal intubation were abandoned. Since we did not have facilities for fibre optic laryngeal intubation, a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted and naso-gastric intubation for gastric decompression done. The procedure of SCT excision was performed with the patient in the left lateral position; instead of the conventional prone jack-knife position. His post-operative recovery was uneventful and he was discharged to the outpatient clinic for follow up on the tenth day post operation. The histopathology report of the excised tumour showed a solid mass lined externally by unremarkable epidermis. The parenchyma demonstrated smooth and skeletal muscles, adipose tissues, cartilage and glandular tissue with no malignant foci. During his first follow up visit by the third week post operation, he was referred to the Maxillofacial surgery unit on account of his TMJ ankylosis. He was however subsequently lost to follow up."
