  "text": "We report on a 71 year-old woman with a recently diagnosed colorectal adenocarcinoma who presented with a severe bacterial meningitis. The cerebrospinal fluid cell count revealed a pleocytosis of 80,000 cells/μl and a severe disturbance of the blood-brain-barrier. Fusobacterium nucleatum was cultured as the causing pathogen. A lumbar MRI showed, in addition to contrast-enhancing meninges as sign of inflammation, a presacral mass. In the next step, the mass was diagnosed as an anterior sacral meningocele connected to the gut. An adequate antibiotic was used to treat the leptomeningitis. The connection between gut and meningocele was closed surgically and the patient recovered well and underwent further treatment of her colorectal adenocarcinoma."
