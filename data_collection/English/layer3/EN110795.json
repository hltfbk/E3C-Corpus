  "text": "A 14-year-old Asian girl came to our hospital with blisters and erosions all over her body and in the oral mucosa. She was diagnosed with pemphigus vulgaris by skin biopsy about 3â€‰months before hospitalization. She was admitted to the intensive care unit due to aggressively worsening symptoms, extensive lesions, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance secondary to excess fluid loss from the skin wounds and sepsis secondary to infection of the exposed wounds. She did not respond to prednisone and azathioprine therapy but was successfully treated with plasmapheresis."
