  "text": "We present a case of complex compound fracture of tibia with bone loss. Interestingly patient sustained this injury in spite of having intramedullary nail in tibia which was inserted to stabilize previous fracture 9 months prior to trauma. The proximal half of the nail was protruding out of the wound at the time of presentation in emergency department. The nail was removed and stabilized with external fixator after wound closure. The bone gap and nonunion at fracture site was managed with Ilizarov fixator. At the end of treatment patient got satisfactory functional outcome."
