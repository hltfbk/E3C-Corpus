  "text": "A 66-year-old lady with neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with painless progressive jaundice for six months. Laboratory investigations revealed iron deficiency anemia and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Tumor markers were normal. Abdominal computed tomography showed a 3 × 2 cm heterogenous mass in the periampullary region with mild dilation of the common bile duct and another 2 × 1.7 cm mass in the fourth portion of the duodenum. Endoscopic biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of periampullary carcinoid. At surgery, multiple small nodules were detected at the hepatic hilum. Frozen section suggested them to be neurofibromas. Patient underwent pancreatoduodenectomy and had uneventful recovery with no recurrence at two months. Microscopic examination of the resected specimen confirmed presence of three tumors: periampullary well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the fourth part of duodenum and plexiform neurofibroma at the hepatic hilum."
