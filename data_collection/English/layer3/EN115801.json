  "text": "We present the case of a 3-year-old Caucasian boy who attended the emergency department following an un-witnessed fall, resulting in right elbow and forearm pain, swelling and deformity. Clinical and radiological examination revealed a Monteggia type IV fracture-dislocation.The patient was treated with closed manipulation and percutaneous fixation of both bone forearm fractures with intra-medullary wires. After failed attempts at closed reduction, open reduction of the radial head was required.The block to reduction was due to a buttonholing of the radial head through the anterior joint capsule, with interposition of the capsule in the radiocapitellar joint. Subsequently, alignment was maintained with fracture healing. Follow-up at five months showed a full range of elbow movement with no adverse symptoms."
