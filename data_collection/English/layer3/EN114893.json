  "text": "Using Optoelectronic Plethysmography, total and regional chest wall volumes were measured in one patient before and after left diaphragmatic plication. Volumes were recorded at quiet breathing. Respiratory capacity improved during quiet breathing when measured before and 6 months after surgery. These improvements occur at the abdominal-rib cage level in both operated and contralateral. Prior to surgery the abdominal rib cage motion was out of phase to the upper rib cage and abdominal compartment in both sides of the chest. Synchrony of all three compartments was restored after plication."
