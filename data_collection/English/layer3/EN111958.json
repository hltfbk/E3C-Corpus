  "text": "A 53-year-old man, who underwent sternoturnover in his childhood, was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention was performed as the acute treatment of the culprit lesion. Because residual lesions were present, he was referred to our department for coronary artery bypass grafting. Enhanced computed tomography revealed bilateral occlusions of the internal thoracic arteries and a small fragile sternum after fixation. Considering postoperative respiratory dysfunction associated with instability of the thorax following median sternotomy, we selected left thoracotomy for coronary artery bypass grafting. Convalescence was uneventful without any respiratory complications."
