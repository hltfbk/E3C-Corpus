  "text": "A 40-year-old Arabic woman presented with headache, palpitations, paroxysmal hypertension, and weight loss, which she had had for the last 3 years. She had a familial history of diabetes and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. A radiological examination revealed thyroid lesions and bilateral adrenal medulla tumors. Our patient had undergone bilateral adrenalectomy, total thyroidectomy with cervical lymphadenectomy, and parathyroidectomy. A pathological examination confirmed the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A consisting of left medullary pheochromocytoma, right medullary composite pheochromocytoma-ganglioneuroma, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid with lymph node metastasis and parathyroid hyperplasia. A genetic analysis also revealed that our patient had a RET germline mutation."
