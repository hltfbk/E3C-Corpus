  "text": "A 46-year-old man weighting 176 kg with BMI 53.7 kg/m2 was scheduled for gastric volume reduction surgery to reduce body weight under general anesthesia. SpO2 decreased during induction, and two hand pressured mask ventilation partial failed. We then placed WEI Nasal Jet Tube (WNJ) in the patient's right nostril to provide SJOV. Then fiberoptic bronchoscopy guided endotracheal intubation was performed via mouth approach, and vital signs were stable. The operation was successfully completed after 3 h. Patient recovered smoothly in hospital for 8 days and did not have any recall inside the operating room."
