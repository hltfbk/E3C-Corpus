  "text": "A 47-year-old man presented with hematemesis and melena, and a diagnosis of decompensated cirrhosis, chronic portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and secondary gastro-esophageal variceal hemorrhage was made. Coagulants were administered, but portal vein thrombi occurred rapidly, and gastrointestinal bleeding recurred shortly thereafter. The patient underwent LT, phlebothrombectomy and a partial jejunectomy. His recovery from a fistula was uneventful, and follow-up visits over 70Â months were unremarkable."
