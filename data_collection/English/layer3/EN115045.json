  "text": "A 56 year old man presented with macroscopic haematuria, acute kidney injury and a platelet count of 35 Ã— 10(9)/L, in the absence of anticoagulation. Urinalysis demonstrated an active urinary sediment. His kidney biopsy demonstrated extensive intraluminal erythrocyte casts associated with acute tubular injury, along with haemosiderin deposition suggestive of recurrent glomerular bleeding. There was no histological evidence of glomerular pathology but electron microscopy analysis demonstrated thin basement membrane disease and effacement of podocyte foot processes. During long term follow-up, thrombocytopaenia and intermittent haematuria persisted. At 9 months, the patient progressed to Stage 5 chronic kidney disease with the development of gross renal atrophy."
