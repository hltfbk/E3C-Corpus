  "text": "Forty five year old male, belonging to Indian/Aryan ethnicity presented with cough, breathlessness and fever for 7Â months with past history of pulmonary tuberculosis. On examination he was found to have pleural effusion for which he received anti-tuberculosis therapy empirically. Later his condition deteriorated and on further examination he was found to have ascites, multiple site venous thrombosis and pyothorax which was found positive for acid fast bacilli. Despite anti-tuberculosis therapy he did not improve and was suspected to be a multidrug resistant case. Later on computed tomography peritoneal nodule was detected and on biopsy revealed malignant mesothelioma."
