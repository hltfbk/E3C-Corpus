  "text": "A 71-year-old Japanese woman complained of deteriorating vision in her left eye. On examination, papilledema was detected, but magnetic resonance imaging only showed slight thickening and enhancement of the left optic nerve. A diagnosis of idiopathic optic neuritis was made and corticosteroid pulse therapy was administered. During the next four months, the patient received a total of four courses of corticosteroid pulse therapy, but she still suffered from bilateral loss of vision. A second magnetic resonance imaging procedure revealed tumors in both orbits and a biopsy showed diffuse large B-cell malignant lymphoma."
