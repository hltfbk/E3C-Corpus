  "text": "An 84-year-old man was referred to our facility with obstructive jaundice and abdominal pain. Imaging studies revealed an irregular filling defect in the middle bile duct by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and an enhanced wall thickening from the middle to distal portion by enhanced computed tomography. The patient was initially diagnosed with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma by a bile duct biopsy and underwent pancreatoduodenectomy with lymph node dissection. The pathological findings showed an NEC with an adenosquamous carcinoma component in the extrahepatic bile duct with lymph node metastases. The patient experienced multiple liver metastases 1 month after surgery and died 3 months after surgery. Due to the rapid progression of his disease, his general condition deteriorated, and he was unable to receive any additional treatments, such as chemotherapy."
