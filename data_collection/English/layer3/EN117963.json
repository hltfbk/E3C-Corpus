  "text": "A 50 years-old women patient underwent four surgical interventions from the bowel gangrene, caused from the superior mesenteric vein thrombosis consequences. After fourth surgical intervention, at eighth post-operative day, the enterocutaneous fistula developed. On 20-th day, after enterocutaneous fistula developed, together with TPN, we administered also octreotide (100 micrograms/8 hours), for 48 hours. The reduction of fistula output, after treatment of TPN in combination with octreotide, compare the treatment only with TPN, was not significant (p < 0, 05). The enterocutaneous fistula, developed after fourth operation, has been spontaneously closed after four months."
