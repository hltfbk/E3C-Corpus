  "text": "Patient 1: A 58-year-old Japanese man developed progressive weakness and subsequent myasthenic symptoms including oculomotor disturbance. Clinical examination and electrophysiological studies confirmed upper and lower motor neuron involvement and NMJ dysfunction, and anti-LRP4 antibody was detected in his serum. A series of immunotherapies, including steroid pulse therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasmapheresis, was performed, and the myasthenic symptoms partially improved. The titer of anti-LRP4 antibody subsequently decreased. However, the therapeutic effect was transient, and ALS symptoms progressed. His clinical findings fulfilled the criteria of probable ALS using the Awaji criteria. Patient 2: A 74-year-old Japanese man suffered from progressive weakness of all limbs and dropped head in the evening. He complained of diplopia with a lateral horizontal gaze. Probable ALS was diagnosed because of the upper and lower motor neuron signs, whereas anti-LRP4 antibody was detected. Several immunotherapies were administered, and the myasthenic symptoms partially responded to each therapy. However, the truncal muscle weakness progressed, and he died of respiratory failure."
