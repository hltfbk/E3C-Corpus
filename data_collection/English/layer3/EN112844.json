  "text": "A 10-year-old girl was admitted to the orthopaedic surgery department for further assessment of a pain localized in the posterior part of the right hemithorax. After magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and surgical biopsy, intraosseus angioleiomyoma of the fourth rib was diagnosed by histopathology examination. Atypical costal localization of this type of a benign tumour presents diagnostic difficulty, especially in children. The differential diagnoses included cartilaginous tumours, Ewing sarcoma, fibrous dysplasia, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, intraosseous haemangioma and metastatic tumours. We report a detailed diagnostic procedure including MRI, selective angiography and histopathologic examination."
