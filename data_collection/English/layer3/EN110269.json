  "text": "A preterm baby girl was born at 27 weeks gestation to a 31-year-old mother by cesarean section. Birth weight was 970 grams and Apgar scores were 6 at one minute and 7 at five minutes. She was admitted to neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress syndrome requiring nasal ventilation. On the second day of hospital stay, the infant had venous umbilical catheter inserted (epicutaneo-Haumont-kit 24G-2Fr-Vygon). X-ray abdomen and chest was done to confirm the position of the CVC. After 3 days of catheter implantation, the patientâ€™s cardiorespiratory condition worsened, and there was an increase of the cardiac area on chest radiography. The baby was intubated immediately and one boluse of normal saline for low blood pressure was required. Electrocardiogram showed a low voltage. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed large pericardial effusion. All fluids through the umbilical catheter were discontinued and a peripheral intravenous line was started. Urgent subxiphoid pericardiocentesis with a scalp vein was performed bedside under echographic guidance. Twenty ml of clear liquid was drained. The fluid was sent for culture which was negative. Proteins and lactate dehydrogenase were normal. Microscopy showed occasional red and white blood cells. An echocardiogram was done after the procedure revealed partially resolution of the pericardial effusion. The newborn was extubated on the 10 th post pericardiocentesis day."
