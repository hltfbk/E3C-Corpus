  "text": "A 14-month-old Arab boy had clinical features typical of severe combined immunodeficiency. His clinical picture and flow cytometric analysis raised the diagnosis of adenosine deaminase deficiency and prompted us to screen the adenosine deaminase gene for mutation(s). We detected a novel mutation in exon 9 of the adenosine deaminase gene (p.Arg282>Gln), which we believe is the cause of the severe combined immunodeficiency phenotype observed in our patient."
