  "text": "We report the first case of a Moroccan family, a father and his three children, in which the diagnosis of type III TRPS was suspected based on severe clinical and radiological features. Molecular analysis of the TRPS1 gene revealed a novel missense mutation in exon 6, (p.Ala932Ser), located in the GATA-type DNA-binding zinc finger domain."
