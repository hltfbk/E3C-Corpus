  "text": "A 44-year-old Chinese female presented with a left renal mass. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) scans revealed a 4.5 cm × 4.0 cm mass in the left kidney. Grossly, the well-demarcated mass was black with moderately firm consistency. Microscopic examination indicated that the tumor was characterized by the presence of nests and cords of polygonal cells with clear and granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, central round to oval nuclei and occasional nucleoli. Intracytoplasmic melanin was observed in approximately 45% of tumor cells. Uniquely, the tumor presented with intranuclear eosinophilic pseudoinclusions and thick-walled stromal blood vessels. IHC showed that tumor cells were diffusely positive for TFE3 and exhibited patchy and weak HMB45 staining. FISH confirmed the presence of TFE3 rearrangement."
