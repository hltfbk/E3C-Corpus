  "text": "We report a rare case of tuberculosis of the scapula in a 14-year-old. Diagnostic clues include lytic areas with low density seen in the body of the scapula involving a glenoid margin associated with typical clinical features. Treatment should include a regimen of four antitubercular drugs along with surgical debridement if required."
