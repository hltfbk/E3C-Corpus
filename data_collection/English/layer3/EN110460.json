  "text": "A 40-year-old male patient reported pain and paresthesia in his right hand in the last 2 months, associated with weakness in the apprehension of objects and difficulty to work. The neurological examination showed a decrease in the sensitivity of the thumb, index, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger, as well as positive Tinel's sign. Electromyography revealed motor and sensory impairment in the median nerve territory. The patient was initially treated with anti-inflammatories and physical therapy, but he did not have improvement. He underwent surgery to release the median nerve by transecting the flexor retinaculum. A few days after hospital discharge, the patient had infection, soft-tissue swelling/edema, heat, pain, and temporary loss of flexibility of the fingers. He was sent back to hospital for surgical wound cleaning and care. The patient was also treated with antibiotics and 2 months of physical therapy. After that, he had some improvement, with partial recovery of the motility of the fingers and wrist, but it was impossible to return to work."
