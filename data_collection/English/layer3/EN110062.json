  "text": "A 45-year old normotensive, euglycaemic, non-smoker was referred from a peripheral hospital to the Cardiology unit of the University College Hospital, Nigeria for evaluation of a syncopal attack. He was in apparent good health until 2 weeks before presentation when he suddenly felt severe giddiness, not preceded by chest pains, palpitations or breathlessness. He was admitted at the peripheral hospital for two days during which the giddiness resolved and was subsequently discharged with instruction to exercise regularly. The first exercise of brisk walk for about thirty minutes in company of a friend was not eventful; however a repeat exercise the following day resulted in a syncopal episode lasting few minutes. He sustained no head injury and there were no associated seizures or urinary incontinence. He was subsequently referred to our centre for further evaluation. Past medical history was unremarkable except for an appendicectomy in 1985 and a urological procedure in 2001 during investigation for infertility. He had no adverse reactions or sequelae. Examination revealed a conscious middle aged man who was not in any distress. He was neither pale nor cyanosed and had no pedal oedema. His pulse was 60 beats per min, regular and normal volume. The peripheral pulses were palpable and there was no carotid bruit. Blood pressure was 130/90 mmHg. First and second heart sounds only were heard. The respiratory, abdominal and nervous system examinations were not remarkable. Initial resting 12-lead ECG, 24-hr ambulatory ECG, trans-thoracic echocardiogram and electroencephalogram (EEG) were essentially normal. Another episode of syncope warranted further investigation. Immediate post syncope ECG showed deeply inverted symmetrical T waves in the anterior leads. An assessment of ischaemic heart disease was made and he was referred to the Madras Medical Mission Chennai India for Coronary angiography and possible revascularisation. On admission at the centre, chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. Resting ECG showed sinus bradycardia with a normal QRS axis and T wave inversion in leads V1-V5. Trans-thoracic echocardiogram showed no regional wall motion abnormalities, normal LV ejection fraction, type II diastolic dysfunction, concentric LVH, mild tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). CK-MB was 17IU/L and troponin I was 0.095ng/ml. Coronary angiogram revealed 70-80% stenosis in the ostial-proximal LAD. Normal right coronary artery with non dominant circumflex artery He had a successful PTCA + DES stent to the LAD. He was also treated with antiplatelets, statins and low molecular weight heparin. Post-procedure course was uneventful and he was discharged after 3 days with stable vital signs."
