  "text": "Our Case Report describes a 65yo Caucasian man with an extensive operative history for Crohn's disease, including 4 laparotomies with small bowel resections to ameliorate small bowel obstructions. He presented with signs and symptoms of a chronic draining sinus, but was found to have a Blind Loop of bowel. This finding is believed to be the result of a surgical complication."
