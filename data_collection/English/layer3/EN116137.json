  "text": "We present a case of laryngeal granulomas on the posterior vocal fold. A 20-year-old woman had an approximately 10-mm tumour in the laryngeal arytenoid region. Manual ventilation resulted in the tumour lodging in the subglottis and the inflated cuff of the intubation tube successfully returned it to its original position during tube withdrawal. Images were obtained using an Airway ScopeÂ® (Hoya-Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) and a video laryngoscope."
