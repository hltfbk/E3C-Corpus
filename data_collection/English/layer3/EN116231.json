  "text": "We present a 57-year-old postmenopausal female with a 3-year history of a scarring alopecic plaque in her frontotemporal region. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of FFA, and she was started on dutasteride 0.5 mg p.o. q.d., and later, topical pimecrolimus 1% b.i.d. was added. Eight months after initiating treatment, she showed hyperpigmentation on her metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, as well as on the cheeks and on the chin; dutasteride and pimecrolimus were discontinued. After 5 months of follow-up, her hyperpigmentation improved by 80% only by using photoprotection."
