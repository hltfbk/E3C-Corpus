  "text": "We hereby report a case of a 52-year-old White woman who presented with complaints of dysuria and urinary tract infection and feeling of nodulation in her vagina for the last 3 years.\nHer medical history revealed that she had no chronic disease. On physical examination, we detected a 2 Ã— 2,5 cm painless hard tumor without signs of inflammation. Blood biochemistry and hemogram were within normal limits. Urinalysis was normal. The MRI revealed normal kidneys and large capacity bladder, with a mass located in the proximal third of the urethra and measuring 19x18 mm.\nThe mass was completely removed by transvaginal excision with a rim of normal tissue. The urethral mucosa was intact. Patient was catheterized for 48 hours and voided well on catheter removal. Histopathological studies confirmed the urethral leiomyoma.\nThe patient remained asymptomatic and there was no evidence of recurrence in the followup."
