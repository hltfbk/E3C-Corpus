  "text": "A 51-year-old Bedouin Arabic man presented to our institution with an incompletely excised, large, fungating, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor occupying most of his right forearm. Staging imaging showed multiple lung nodules. He underwent wide local excision followed by skin graft and tendon transfer as a palliative measure to preserve the function of his dominant limb. The operation was performed without any complications, and the patient had an excellent postoperative result. Afterward, he was started on multiple lines of chemotherapy that failed because of disease progression, and the patient died 7 months after the operation."
