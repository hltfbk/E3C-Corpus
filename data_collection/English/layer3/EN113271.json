  "text": "A 19-year-old female presented with persistent right knee pain after an atraumatic episode ofpatellar dislocation during walking. The patient had a history of recurrent patella instability of the right knee with an onset at the age of 8 years due to a minor trauma. Patellar apprehension sign was positive bilaterally. There was radiological evidence of bilateral small patellae, hypoplastic femoral trochlea, and tibial tuberosity. A direct sequencing of the coding regions in the TBX4 gene had confirmed the diagnosis of SPS. A novel heterozygous mutation (p.L39PfsX35) was found in the patient and her father. Surgical treatment was indicated and the patient underwent an isolated medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction while no distal realignment osteotomy was performed due to hypoplastic tibial tuberosity. Excellent subjective and objective outcomes were obtained at 1 year postoperatively."
