  "text": "A 68-year-old woman with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma in her right eye underwent filtration surgery with implantation of the Ex-PPESS shunt (model P-50, Alcon Japan, Tokyo, Japan) in combination with intra-surgical 0.04% mitomycin C use. After the anterior chamber injection of viscoelastic material and 100% sulfur hexafluoride gas for treatment of early postoperative over filtration, the intraocular pressure (IOP) was controlled between 9 and 12 mmHg. On postoperative day 121, gonioscopy showed that synechial formation around the shunt obstructed the axial port leaving the relief port opened. On postoperative day 274, the intraocular pressure increased to 40 mmHg and synechiae obstructed both the axial and relief ports. Dispersion of iris tissue by neodymium:yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser (2 mJ, one shot to each port) opened both ports and immediately lowered the IOP, leaving peripheral anterior synechiae around the shunt. Up to postoperative day 400, the IOP was controlled between 13 and 15 mmHg, and the cystic bleb was maintained."
