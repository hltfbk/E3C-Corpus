  "text": "An 11-year-old girl had an enhancing mass, 61 × 54 × 65 mm in size and numerous daughter nodules throughout the entire spleen on a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen and angiography. The patient was treated by complete embolization at the distal level of splenic artery, which resulted in total splenic infarction. Treatment-related complications were thrombocytosis and postembolization syndrome, including abdominal pain and, intermittent fever below 39 °C. There were no other serious complications, including bleeding."
