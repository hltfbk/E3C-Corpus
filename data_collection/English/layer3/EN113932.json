  "text": "A 31-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosis in remission was evaluated for chronic left wrist pain without significant examination findings on presentation. She did not have any constitutional symptoms. Basic investigations did not reveal any significant abnormalities. She was treated with increasing immunosuppression as for lupus related arthritis. Subsequently she developed a wrist effusion with high inflammatory markers, and was treated as septic arthritis. Synovial biopsy features suggested tuberculosis. The patient's symptoms improved with surgical intervention and anti-tuberculosis treatment."
