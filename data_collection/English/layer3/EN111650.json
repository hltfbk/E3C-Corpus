  "text": "We report the successful resection of a Kommerell's diverticulum with left subclavian artery transfer to the left carotid artery in a 5-month-old Japanese boy. The patient was prenatally diagnosed as having a right aortic arch, and a vascular ring was confirmed at 4â€‰months of age with enhanced computed tomography. The pathology of the resected aortic wall revealed severe disruption and fragmentation of elastic fibers associated with a disarray of smooth muscle cells in the tunica media, and cystic medial necrosis with mucoid extracellular matrix deposition."
