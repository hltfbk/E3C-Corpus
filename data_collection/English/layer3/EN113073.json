  "text": "A 61-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of increasing pain in his left groin, and numbness and radiating pain in the anterior and medial thigh caused by a ganglion cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cyst situated at medial the iliopsoas muscle and tendon. The dimensions of the cyst were 56 mm in the coronal view, 22Ã—24mm in the axial view. The mass, which was compressing the neurovascular bundle, was connected to the hip joint. A ganglion stalk incision was performed using hip arthroscopy, and the pain and numbness disappeared immediately after surgery. At 6months after surgery, the ganglion cyst had almost disappeared."
