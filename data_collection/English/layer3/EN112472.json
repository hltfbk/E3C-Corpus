  "text": "We present a case report of a patient with an unusual combination of a Bosworth injury with a pilon fracture and an open multifragmentary talus fracture and our approach for open reduction and internal fixation. At one year postoperative, the patient developed an invalidating tibiotalar and subtalar arthrosis that eventually required an ankle-hindfoot arthrodesis. A Bosworth injury is an infrequent entity and is even rarer when associated with other fractures. Careful preoperative planning is necessary, as the combination of these fractures is a surgical challenge. Special care must be taken to preserve the neurovascular bundle."
