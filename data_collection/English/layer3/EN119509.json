  "text": "We report a case of congenital alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in an 18-month-old male who presented with a progressively increasing mass lesion in the left post-auricular region since birth. Radiological examination did not show any intracranial involvement of the mass lesion. Upon resecting the mass that was 10-cm in largest dimension, the gross, microscopic, and ultrastructural findings were consistent with congenital alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma."
