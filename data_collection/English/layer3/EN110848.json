  "text": "Here, we report the case of a 75-year-old Japanese man with giant paratesticular liposarcoma. Imaging studies revealed a 26 cm tumor in his right scrotum and lung metastases at presentation. He underwent radical orchiectomy followed by systemic chemotherapies. Pathological findings of the resected primary tumor confirmed a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. He then started chemotherapy treatment with gemcitabine plus docetaxel. His disease status was stable for 1 year. Eribulin was used for second-line chemotherapy. He had a relapse at 5 months after eliburin and died at 22 months after diagnosis."
