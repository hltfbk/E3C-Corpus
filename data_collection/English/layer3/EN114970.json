  "text": "We identified a Chinese family with three persons carry MECP2 gene duplication: a boy, his mother and his grandmother. The duplication segment which was detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) included gene MECP2, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), filamin A (FLNA), and L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM). Furthermore, array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed on the mother, showed that MECP2 containing duplication was 510 Kb (153,113,885-153,624,154), including 16 other genes except MECP2. The boy showed most symptoms of MECP2 duplication syndrome. His mother and maternal grandmother were asymptomatic. Both female carriers had a skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI), which were 80:20 and 74:26 respectively."
