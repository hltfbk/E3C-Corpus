  "text": "We report a case of a 47-year-old female farmer with no relevant past history who sustained a snakebite by an Echis occellatus viper during an agricultural activity. Her initial management consisted in visiting a traditional healer who administered her some herbal remedies orally and applied a white balm on the affected limb. Due to progressive deterioration of her condition, she was rushed to our surgical department where she arrived 20 h after the snakebite incident. On admission she presented in a state of shock (suggestive of an anaphylactic shock), coagulopathy, renal impairment, and gangrene of the entire right upper limb. Emergency management consisted of fluid resuscitation, repeated boluses of adrenaline, a total of three vials of polyvalent anti-venom sera, promethazine, analgesics, corticosteroids, and administration of fresh frozen plasma. Within four hours of emergency department hospitalisation she developped signs of sepsis and persistent hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation, suggestive of an associated septic shock. Management pursued with antiobiotherapy and administration of noradrenaline through an electric pump syringe to achieve a mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mmHg. The patient deceased at the 10th hour of hospitalisation in a state of circulatory collapse unresponsive to vasopressors, coagulopathy, renal failure, sepsis and gangrene of the right forearm."
