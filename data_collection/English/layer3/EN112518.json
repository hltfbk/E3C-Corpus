  "text": "A previously healthy 15-year-old rural adolescent male presented with a 2-month history of weight loss and fatigue. We strongly suspected a Klatskin tumor; therefore, exploratory laparotomy was performed. However, the microscopical findings revealed a granuloma consisting of epithelioid cells, caseous necrosis, and lymphocytic infiltration, indicating caseating granulomatous inflammation and yielding a final diagnosis of hepatic hilar tuberculosis."
