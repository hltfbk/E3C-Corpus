  "text": "We report a 13-year-old male with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission presenting with anemia and weight loss. Examination was significant for absence of abdominal pain, but a stool sample was positive for occult blood. Pan-endoscopy was performed with colonoscopy revealing a mass filling the colonic lumen. Biopsy of the mass confirmed recurrence of recurrent B-cell lymphoma. Computed tomography scan revealed ileocolic intussusception resulting from the tumor. This case is unusual in that the patient had no abdominal pain despite the presence of intussusception."
