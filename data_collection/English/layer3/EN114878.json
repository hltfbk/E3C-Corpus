  "text": "A 47-year-old male was admitted to our orthopedic department for bilateral knee pain and a preoperative fixed flexion contracture of 90Â°. A diagnosis of adult-onset Still's disease was made based on the patient's medical history of a high spiking fever, salmon-colored rash and bilateral knee and wrist pain. Bilateral total knee arthroplasty was carried out to address these deformities, but residual flexion contracture was present. Subsequently, serial casting was used to achieve full extension at four weeks after surgery. Excellent function and patient satisfaction were observed at two years of follow-up."
