  "text": "A 26 year old South-Asian female presented in a state of haemodynamic shock with a history of fever and use of non-steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. Dengue was suspected clinically and later confirmed. Following stabilization and while still in the febrile phase the patient developed bradycardia with dynamic electrocardiogram changes which evolved into complete heart block. However there was no circulatory compromise. Clinical picture was further complicated by the development of dengue haemorhaghic fever and cautious fluid resuscitation was carried out in correlation to clinical and haematological parameters. Impaired coagulation profile necessitated administration of activated factor seven on the backdrop of low platelets and bleeding. Cardiac pacing could be avoided due to maintenance of vitals within acceptable parameters."
