  "text": "We present an 81-year-old patient who was suffering from increasing dysphagia and dysphonia related to a painless giant cervical mass, which presented with progressive growth for the preceding months. After a core needle biopsy with a suspicion of a solitary fibrous tumor, total excision of the tumor was successfully performed, and the pathology examination revealed a fibrosarcoma. Following surgery, radiotherapy was decided in the oncological multidisciplinary meeting; however, the patient refused it. There were neither new clinical symptoms nor tumor recurrence after an 18-month follow-up."
