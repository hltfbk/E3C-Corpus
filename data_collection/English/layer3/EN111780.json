  "text": "We herein report a case of a 37-year-old-male with eccrine carcinoma occurring on the left posterior occipital scalp which invaded the skull and dura, presenting with progressive headache. This patient has performed three surgeries in total. During the last hospitalization, he underwent an extended surgical resection, lymphadenectomy, myocutaneous flap transplantation and vascular anastomosis in our institution. After surgery, he was treating with radiotherapy at 200 Gray in 12 fractions. But one year after the operation, he developed chest tightness, imaging examination and biopsy puncture revealed pulmonary metastasis."
