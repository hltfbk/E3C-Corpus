  "text": "A 74-year-old woman was treated for hypertensive crisis. After her high blood pressure had been controlled and stabilized, she was discharged home. However, the same day, she complained about an acute decrease in vision in her left eye. Best corrected visual acuity was 20/20 on the right eye and 20/200 on the left eye. On biomicroscopy, a hyphema was seen. Iris neovascularization was absent, IOP and fundus examination were normal. After spontaneous resolution of the hyphema, a fluorescein angiography of the anterior segment was performed, which revealed bilateral subtle early hyperfluorescence with late staining scattered at the pupillary margin. The patient was diagnosed with iris microhemangiomatosis. During the follow-up of 24 months, the blood pressure was stable and well controlled. The patient did not experience any recurrent hemorrhage."
