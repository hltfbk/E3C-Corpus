  "text": "An 83 year old lady initially underwent an extended right open hemicolectomy for a mid-transverse colonic adenocarcinoma (T4N2M0). No adjacent structures were involved. After adjuvant chemotherapy, she was kept under regular surveillance. A CT scan and colonoscopy at one year were normal. At 18 months investigations including an ultrasound scan of the liver and a radioisotope bone scan were all negative. Over three and half years later the patient presented with an incisional hernia. Repeat CT scan and tumour markers were reported as negative. At operation, a mass was found within the anterior abdominal wall complicating the incisional hernia. This mass was widely resected and a laparotomy performed. Histology confirmed an adenocarcinoma of colonic origin extending to one of the lateral margins. A post-operative PET scan confirmed the absence of intra-abdominal pathology."
