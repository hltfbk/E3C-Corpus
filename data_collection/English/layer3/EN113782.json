  "text": "We present a case of sinonasal renal cell-like carcinoma in a 63-year-old male patient. Computer tomography(CT) scanning revealed a soft tissue mass at the left nasal cavity and choana. Histologically, the predominant tumor architecture was follicular to glandular with intervening fibrous septa. The tumor cells were uniform cuboidal to polyhedral with abundant clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were strongly positive for CK7, EMA, vimentin, SOX10, S-100, and focally positive for CA9. During 6Â months of follow-up, there was no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence or metastasis."
