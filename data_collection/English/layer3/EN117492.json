  "text": "An 82-year-old Caucasian man was diagnosed with ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate after undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate for urinary retention. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the nature of the tumor. The patient was treated with triptorelin, 3.75 mg once/month, and bicalutamide, 50 mg 1 Ã— 1. The serum prostate-specific antigen at three, six and 12 months after transurethral resection of the prostate was 0.1 ng/ml. The patient remains asymptomatic, and he entered a six-month follow-up protocol."
