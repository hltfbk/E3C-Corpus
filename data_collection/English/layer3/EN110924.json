  "text": "A 66-year-old Caucasian woman, with metastatic disease, was admitted with a right pertrochanteric fracture. She underwent closed reduction and long intramedullary nail fixation. Five days post-operatively, a sudden hemoglobin drop occurred. A computed tomography demonstrated an extensive hematoma. Angiography confirmed an arterial bleeding from the superior gluteal artery and subsequent selective embolization was successfully performed."
