  "text": "A 64-year-old woman with Crohn's disease (CD) was referred to Siriraj Hospital due to worsening of abdominal pain and watery diarrhea for 2â€‰weeks. The dose of immunosuppressive agents was increased for presumed exacerbation of CD. Pathologic examination of tissue obtained from polypoid mass at ileocecal valve and multiple clean-based ulcers at cecum revealed active ileitis and colitis with multiple round shape organisms with capsule, which was compatible with Cryptococcus species. Disseminated cryptococcosis was diagnosed due to gastrointestinal involvement and presumed pulmonary involvement regarding the presence of an oval-shaped cavitary lesion on chest X-ray and computed tomography of the lung. Patient was successfully treated with amphotericin B followed by fluconazole with satisfactory result."
