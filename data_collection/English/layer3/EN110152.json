  "text": "Wearing heals, the 37 years old female patient referred to Emergency room for pain in the right ankle secondary to pushing the brake pedal during a traffic accident. On the physical examination, patient was ambulatory, although minimal limping was observed in right lower limb, and no swelling was noted on the ankle. Local tenderness was not found at medial and lateral malleolar localizations. Fibular compression test was negative and no tenderness was palpated on the fibula. On baseline radiographies, no fracture was observed and soft tissue injury was considered. Patient referred to Orthopedics outpatient clinic 2 days later, since pain persisted at the ankle. Patient was examined again according to Ottawa criteria. In addition to findings identified above, patient could not walk even for 4 steps. Radiographies were re-evaluated. Computed tomography was scanned. A bone fragment with 25% separation was observed on the posterior malleolus and the fragment was also extending to articular surface. Spinal anesthesia was induced. One compression screw was fasted at posteroanterior orientation and the fracture was fixed. Ankle exercises were started at early postoperative course. Patient was mobilized with two crutches for 3 weeks without bearing load. Patient was allowed bearing load at Week 6, as long as patient could tolerate. Patient could be mobilized without crutches at Week 8. On final radiographies, union was verified and ROM of the ankle was intact. AOFAS (American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society) score was 96."
