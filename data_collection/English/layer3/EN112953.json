  "text": "We describe a 36-year-old man, with no psychiatric history, except for a possible disorder in the use of cannabis, who developed catatonia after epileptic seizures. The catatonia did not respond to the anticonvulsant therapy, but did so to lorazepam 17Â mg/d. Lorazepam could be tapered slowly and stopped without reemergence of catatonic signs."
