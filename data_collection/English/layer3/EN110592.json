  "text": "A 36-year-old man was diagnosed with an isolated volar dislocation of the DRUJ. The clinical examination, X-rays, and computed tomography scan allowed an early diagnosis. A reduction by external maneuvers was performed and the patient was immobilized in an above elbow plaster cast for 6 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal any capsuloligamentous lesions requiring surgery. Evolution was favorable."
