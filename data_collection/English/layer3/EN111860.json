  "text": "In July 2014, a 63-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a large CBT (130 mm × 60 mm × 70 mm). The lesion was hypervascular, spanned from the first to the seventh cervical vertebra, and adhered to the right common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA). The resection was carried out in a hybrid operating theatre. First, we used Onyx gel to embolize the feeding artery. An ICA balloon was used to prevent gel entry into the ICA. After shrinkage and hardening of the CBT, we quickly resected the CBT as well as a part of the ECA that adhered to the CBT. A vascular shunt was inserted between CCA and ICA, and the part where the ICA was cut off from the CCA was directly sutured. A follow-up at four years later showed no neurological damage."
