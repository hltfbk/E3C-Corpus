  "text": "A white 23-year-old man experienced a road accident and was diagnosed with proximal tibiofibular dislocation associated with an open fracture of the tibia and injury to the external popliteus sciatic nerve. He was treated immediately with an intramedullary tibial nail and a cancellous screw at the level of the proximal tibiofibular articulation."
