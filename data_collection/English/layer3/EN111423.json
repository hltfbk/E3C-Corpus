  "text": "The patient, a 33-year-old woman, had epigastric distension for half a year. Examinations were performed in a local hospital. Computed tomography scan showed round soft tissue nodules, about 5.45 cm in diameter, in the hepatic-gastric space. Endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration was performed on the patient. Rapid on-site evaluation, hematoxylin eosin staining and histopathology of the puncture smear was performed. According to the Diff-Quik staining and hematoxylin eosin staining results of preoperative endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration puncture smears as well as the immunohistochemistry results, Castleman disease was highly suspected. A sufficient preoperative evaluation was made, and a precise surgical plan was developed. Postoperative pathology confirmed Castleman disease."
