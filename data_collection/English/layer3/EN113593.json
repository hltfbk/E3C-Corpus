  "text": "A 58-year-old male patient with BCC on the left nasolabial sulcus for 17 years, reporting 3 previous excisions, evolved with local recurrence. A new procedure was performed, and anatomopathological study confirmed sclerosing BCC. Seven months later, he presented with a mass in the left submandibular region. Combined positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) showed cervical hypercaptation in the left cervical level I and vertebral body of L5. Excision of the cervical lesion was performed with diagnosis of sclerosing BCC compromising the submandibular gland. Biopsy of the lumbar lesion was found to be compatible with bone metastasis."
