  "text": "A 56-year-old woman was complaining about decrease in vision in her left eye. The patient was on the waiting list for a corneal transplant on her right eye due to corneal leucoma after a previous herpes infection. The patient was diagnosed with choroidal melanoma in her left eye. Due to the tumor size (longitudinal diameter >10 mm; anterior-posterior diameter >16 mm) the patient decided to undergo enucleation, after being informed about different treatment options (brachytherapy and enucleation). The patient showed her willingness to use the cornea of the left eye as a transplant for her right eye. After discussion with the ethical committee and its approval, and signing informed consent, the patient underwent enucleation of her left eye. The sample was examined by a pathologist and found to be free of melanoma cells in the corneolimbal tissue. Afterwards, trepanation of the donor cornea button was performed and transplanted to the left eye."
