  "text": "Written consent was obtained from the patient prior to writing this case report. A 28 year old farmer from rural South Sudan presented to the emergency department of Juba teaching Hospital, complaining of shortness of breath and fatigue of 2 weeks duration. Eighteen months previously he had presented to a rural clinic in Yei complaining of abdominal pain and vomiting. Due to lack of access to Ultrasound and CT, an exploratory laparotomy was performed, finding a large hepatic cyst. The cyst was removed and the patient initially gained symptomatic relief. However, over the following six months, he complained of increasing abdominal distension, pain, weight loss and poor appetite.\nOn examination, there were reduced breath sounds throughout the right lung with coarse left basal inspiratory crackles. The abdomen was grossly distended with multiple palpable masses and a large incisional hernia measuring 4cm x 6cm was present. The abdomen was non tender, with audible bowel sounds. A chest X-ray on admission revealed a massively elevated right hemi-diaphragm. Abdominal Ultrasound revealed multiple cysts of varying sizes throughout the abdominal and pelvic cavities, the largest cyst measuring 20cm * 19cm. Stool microscopy was positive for Echinococcal cysts. Bloods revealed a microcytic anemia, with a haemoglobin of 68.\nA diagnosis of secondary peritoneal hydatidosis and subsequent pneumonia was made. In the acute setting, the patient was transfused with red cells and given intravenous Co-Amoxiclav, his shortness of breath responding well to this initial treatment. He has now received 14 weeks of Albendazole and Metronidazole treatment, with the cysts showing a moderate reduction in size. With the current political situation throughout South Sudan the patient was lost to follow-up."
