  "text": "A 53-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital for further examination of left back pain due to hydronephrosis. Enhanced computed tomography demonstrated ureter stenosis in front of the ilium, which was surrounded by a retroperitoneal tumor. The tumor was penetrated by blood vessels; therefore, we performed an open surgical biopsy on the suspicion of a retroperitoneal tumor using ureteroscopic assistance. The diagnosis of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis was made according to the biopsy."
