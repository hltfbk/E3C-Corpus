  "text": "A Japanese man in his mid-sixties was diagnosed with unresectable lung adenocarcinoma and was unresponsive to cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The BRAF V600E mutation was detected by next generation sequencing, and the patient was subjected to treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib in combination. Although the treatment reduced the tumor size, he experienced myalgia and muscle weakness with elevated serum creatine kinase and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis induced by dabrafenib and trametinib. After the patient recovered from rhabdomyolysis, the treatment doses of dabrafenib and trametinib were reduced, which prevented further rhabdomyolysis and maintained tumor shrinkage."
