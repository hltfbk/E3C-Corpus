  "text": "The 48-year-old male patient applied to the gastroenterology clinic with the epigastric pain complaint. There were no characteristics in his background story. During the physical examination, sensitivity in the epigastric zone was detected. The routine blood test and tumor marker test results were normal. Any pathologies but antral gastritis were not detected as a result of the patient's upper gastrointestinal system endoscopy. A solid lesion which was in the size of 30 x 40 mm was detected in the head of pancreas and loss of fat plane between the pancreas and lesion, which raise doubt of a mass in the pancreas as a result of the abdominal tomography. There was expansion in the proximal wirsung canal of the mass. Surgical intervention was scheduled since the patient was symptomatic and on account of the solid content of the lesion. We performed pancreaticoduodenectomy, because we could not distinguished whether it was benign or malign tumor by CT findings. As a result of the macroscopic pathological examination of the specimen removed, a polypoid mass lesion with dimensions 4 x 3 cm that retained the 0.7 cm proximal in the duodenum wall of the oddi sphincter at medial and anterior was observed. It was observed that the lesion was located on the tumor's submucosa and expanded on the head of pancreas. The BGA presence was reported on the localization of the head of pancreas as a result of the histopatologic examination. Besides, no findings supporting malignity was observed and there were 14 reactive lymph nodes on this specimen. The patient was discharged on the 7th day following the operation."
