  "text": "We report two cases of brucellosis in two Caucasian men, aged 17 and 34 years old, with myocarditis and asymptomatic pericardial effusion, respectively. Of note, neither patient had concomitant endocarditis. The disease was confirmed serologically and by blood cultures. Both patients recovered completely after receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment without any sign of relapse during a follow-up of 12 months."
