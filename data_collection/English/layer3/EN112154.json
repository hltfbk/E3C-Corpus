  "text": "A 47-year-old previously healthy female presented with generalised body swelling with disproportionate ascites and loss of appetite and weight for four-month duration. She denied any contact or past history of TB and reported no respiratory symptoms. Physical examination revealed significant ascites. There was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Respiratory system examination was normal. Her Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) was above 100. Tuberculin skin test was positive with 17mm. Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography (CECT) abdomen revealed chronic liver disease with ascites. Diagnostic laparoscopy was in favour of miliary TB and the peritoneal biopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation with caseous necrosis, suggestive of TB. The patient was started on antituberculosis treatment and subsequently improved."
