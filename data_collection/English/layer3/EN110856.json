  "text": "We report a 48-year-old Chinese woman who had difficulty moving her right hip from abduction and external rotation after falling from 3 m. Pelvic radiograph and three-dimensional reconstruction of computed tomography revealed acetabular anterior wall fractures combined with fractures of the anterior inferior iliac spine and the iliac wing but not involving the pelvic brim. First, the patient underwent interim management by closed reduction of the hip dislocation and skin traction for 6 d. Then, we used a modified pararectus approach for treatment to fix the acetabular fractures with a reconstruction plate and nonlocking T-shape plate. At the 9-mo follow-up, the patient could walk painlessly without necrosis of the femoral head or heterotopic ossification, and the X-rays and computed tomography scan reconstructions showed good bone union."
