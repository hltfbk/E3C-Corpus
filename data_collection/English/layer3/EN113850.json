  "text": "A 24-year old woman was referred for coronary angiography because of typical progressive angina pectoris. On bicycle ergometry, there were both reproducible symptoms and deep ST segment depressions on precordial leads. Semi-selective angiography of the left coronary artery revealed high-grade ostial stenosis. Because of persistent angina pectoris and electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial ischemia, immediate percutaneous coronary angioplasty with subsequent implantation of an everolimus-eluting stent was performed. This intervention was performed with excellent angiographic results. Because of several concomitant criteria including hypoechogenicity on postprocedural intravascular ultrasonography, the diagnosis of Takayasu's disease was made. The patient was treated with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide for 5 months. Because of recurrent angina pectoris, another coronary angiography was performed, which revealed high-grade in-stent-restenosis. Immunomodulatory therapy was switched to high-dose prednisolone and the anti-IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab. The high-grade in-stent-restenosis persisted, and aortocoronary bypass graft surgery was performed with two saphenous vein grafts to the left anterior descending and circumflex artery. Since then, the patient has been doing well for 2 years."
