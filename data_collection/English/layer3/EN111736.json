  "text": "A 50-year-old male was found to have a right axillary mass for 20 years. Specialist examination found cafe-au-lait spots on many parts of the skin, rounded nodules in the skin, a bulge in the right armpit, touching a lump (10 cm Ã— 6 cm, hard, unclear boundary, poor mobility, local tenderness). The anterior side of the thigh felt weakened on the opposite side; in the right groin a swollen lymph node (hard, clear border, good mobility, local tenderness). According to the results of positron emission tomography/computed tomography, puncture pathology and immunohistochemistry, genetic testing, a diagnosis of NF1 with spindle cell sarcoma was confirmed. According to the genetic testing result, the patient was given a targeted treatment with crizotinib."
