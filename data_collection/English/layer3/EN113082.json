  "text": "Our patient was a 64-year-old male who sustained a proximal humerus fracture after a motorcycle collision and underwent an ORIF of the proximal humerus with plate fixation. Postoperatively, the patient had stiffness of the shoulder so he underwent a manipulation under anesthesia of the shoulder. On post-operative day 5, the patient developed an erythematous area over the incision. This area opened up and began to drain by post-operative day 10. The patient underwent an irrigation and debridement of the shoulder with partial removal of hardware. He was also started on antibiotics and clinically cleared his infection."
