  "text": "An 8-year-old girl presented with a 2-month history of headaches. On occasions the headaches were associated with redness and watering of her left eye. She denied any visual loss or visual symptoms. Her visual acuity was reduced to 6/30 in her left eye. Fundal examination revealed a unilateral chorioretinitis. Investigation did not reveal a specific cause for the chorioretinitis. Over 15Â months her visual acuity improved to 6/9 but the fundal appearance changed and a diagnosis of DUSN was made. She was treated with focal laser, systemic anti-helminthic and immunosuppressive treatments but continued to develop new, active areas of chorioretinitis, raising the possibility of multiple worms in the sub-retinal space. There is also a concern as to other central nervous system (CNS) involvement given her significant and ongoing headaches."
