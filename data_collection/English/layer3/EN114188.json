  "text": "A 46-year-old Chinese male initially presented with fever, headache, and impaired memory and developed disturbance of consciousness after admission. A clinical diagnosis of Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, massive cerebral infarction and haemorrhagic transformation (left internal carotid arterial system, inflammatory thrombus) were made based on brain radiography, blood culture and postoperative pathological examinations. These symptoms improved following antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and conventional treatments for stroke."
