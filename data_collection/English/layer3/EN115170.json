  "text": "A 30-year-old woman with a family history of colon adenocarcinoma in a young brother presented to our emergency department with a 2-month history of intermittent colicky abdominal pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Physical examination showed a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Computed tomography showed a 3-layered structure giving the characteristic target-shaped appearance in the ascending colon, highly suggestive for an ileocolic intussusception associated with right colic parietal thickening and an adjacent lymphadenopathy. Patient was planned for laparoscopic exploration and eventually definitive surgery. Intra-operatively, we found an ileocolic intussusception with thickening of the colic wall and slight proximal intestinal dilation. Multiple lymphadenopathies along the ileocecal artery were observed. Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was performed following strict oncologic principles with \"en bloc resection\" and lymphadenectomy given the risk of an underlying malignancy. Considering this risk, previous reduction of the invaginated segments was not attempted and primary extracorporeal anastomosis was performed using manual sutures. Macroscopic examination of the resected specimen revealed a tumor mass of the caecal wall .The histological analysis identified a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma invading the serosa (T3) without permeation of the lymphatic or venous capillaries. No lymphatic metastasis of 28 nodes removed was seen. Postoperative course was uneventful and patient was discharged 5 days after surgery. Postoperative chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT scan were normal. Therefore, tumor is classified as stage II A (T3N0 M0).There was loss of MLH2 and MSH6 protein expression on immunohistochemistry findings reflecting a microsatellite instability phenotype, and the patient was followed up without adjuvant chemotherapy."
