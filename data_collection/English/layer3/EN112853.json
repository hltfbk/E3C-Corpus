  "text": "The patient was a 63-year-old man who had been diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome 6 years ago. He had started taking Deferasirox at 125 mg due to post-transfusion iron overload 6 months ago. Deferasirox was then increased to 1000 mg three months ago. When the serum creatinine level increased, Deferasirox was reduced to 500 mg three weeks before hospitalization. Although the serum creatinine level decreased once, he developed a fever and macroscopic hematuria one week before hospitalization. The serum creatinine level increased again, and Deferasirox was stopped four days before hospitalization. He was admitted for the evaluation of acute kidney injury and gross hematuria. Treatment with temporary hemodialysis was required, and a kidney biopsy was performed on the eighth day of admission. Although there was no major abnormality in the glomeruli, the leakage of red blood cells into the Bowman's space was observed. Erythrocyte cast formation was observed in the tubular lumen, which was associated with acute tubular necrosis. The results of an electron microscopic study were compatible with TBMD."
