  "text": "We report a 50-year-old female patient who had undergone a dacryocystectomy for the left lacrimal sac mass. Postoperative pathological examination confirmed the presence of primary malignant melanoma. Three months later, a lump in the lacrimal sac area was found. The patient underwent CT and MR examinations. CT scan demonstrated a partially well-defined soft mass in the fossa of left lacrimal sac extending into the nasolacrimal duct and anterior ethmoid sinus. MRI revealed an intermediate signal intensity on T1 and iso-or hyper-signal on T2 weighted images. Histopathological examination on biopsy confirmed recurrence of primary lacrimal sac melanoma."
