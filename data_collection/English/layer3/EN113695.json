  "text": "An 87Â years old male with history of chronic constipation presents with severe abdominal pain to the emergency department. The patient was hemodynamically stable. On physical examination, the abdomen was mildly distended with moderate tenderness. Lab work was significant for leukocytosis and lactic acidosis. Abdominal CT scan revealed large amount of retained stool in the colon, bowel wall thickening and infiltration of peri-colonic fat, which were suggestive for stercoral colitis. Patient was started on IV fluids and antibiotics. He was given an enema, followed by laxative and manual disimpaction of stool. Colonoscopy was performed and biopsies were obtained. Tissue biopsy was significant for focal active colitis with regenerative glandular changes and neural hyperplasia."
