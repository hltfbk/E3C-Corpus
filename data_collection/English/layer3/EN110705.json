  "text": "We report about of a 10-year-old girl with osteofibrous dysplasia-like adamantinoma initially diagnosed as osteofibrous dysplasia and treated via intercalary segmental resection with partial cortex preservation using a pedicled vascularized fibula graft for reconstruction. Bone union was observed 9â€‰weeks after surgery. Twenty-two months after the definitive surgery, no recurrence was observed."
