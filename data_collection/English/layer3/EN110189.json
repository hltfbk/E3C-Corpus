  "text": "We report a case of a 22-year-old man with a long history of cocaine, cannabis, and tobacco abuse. He presented to our emergency department for onset severe chest pain. An initial physical examination demonstrated a blood pressure of 100/60 mmHg, heart rate of 112 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min. Cardiovascular and lung examination were unremarkable. Eighteen-lead electrocardiogram on admission revealed a sinus rhythm and elevated ST segment in the anterior leads with biphasic T waves in V1-V5. Echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of about 28% with anteroseptal, inferoseptal, lateral, and apical akinesis. Urgent coronary angiography revealed ostial occlusion of the left anterior descending artery requiring desobstruction and implantation of a bare metal stent (BMS). The patient was discharged after 5 days.\nHe presented 4 months later with typical chest pain at rest. Although he had not discontinued double antiplatelet therapy, he had resumed cocaine use. Catheterization revealed severe in-stent restenosis and the patient underwent a stenting with a drug-eluting stent (DES).\nAfter one year follow-up, our patient remains asymptomatic, and ejection fraction rose to 38%, and he was scheduled for detoxification."
