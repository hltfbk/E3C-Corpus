  "text": "A 58-year-old female presented with graft rejection 1 year following a DSAEK procedure. The episode started when she tapered down her loteprednol to once a day. Slit-lamp examination showed a mildly injected conjunctiva with 1+ corneal oedema. On the posterior surface of the cornea, there was an endothelial rejection line (Khodadoust line) with keratic precipitates and multiple areas of anterior synechia."
