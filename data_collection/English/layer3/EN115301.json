  "text": "We present the case of a 20-year-old female patient with a first episode of a drug-induced psychotic syndrome but without neurological deficits. Further investigations showed a reproducible low-titre positive anti-Yo reactivity in the CSF and serum with two independent immunoblot assays. Magnetic resonance imaging showed frontoparietal and cerebellar atrophy. On [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, a mild cerebellar hypometabolism was found. No underlying tumor was detected."
