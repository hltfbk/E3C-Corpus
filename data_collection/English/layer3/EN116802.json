  "text": "A 59-year-old white male has noted an asymptomatic tumour on the right side of his scrotal sac for several years. This tumour has increased slowly and caused local scrotal pain. An inguinal incision was performed, in which the hypoplastic testis, the epididymis and the tumour could be easily mobilized. Macroscopically the tumour showed a solid round nonencapsulated whorling cut surface. Histologically the diagnosis of a leiomyoma was made."
