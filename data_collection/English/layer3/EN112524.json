  "text": "An 81-year-old Asian man presented to our department with complaints of fever since the preceding day. Abdominal computed tomography revealed the presence of a low-density mass in the right iliopsoas muscle indicative of a psoas abscess. Computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage of the psoas abscess was performed. Results of organism cultures of the abscess and blood were positive for P. micra. However, our patient had no known primary focus of infection. On the basis of these findings, a primary psoas abscess caused by P. micra was diagnosed, and treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5 g, administered intravenously every 8 h, was initiated. By day 7, the patient's white blood cell count normalized. By day 20, his C-reactive protein level was decreased to 0.35 mg/dl."
