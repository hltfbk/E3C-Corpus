  "text": "We report the case of a 72-year-old man with traumatic neuroma of the cystic duct after cholecystectomy. This tumor was mistaken for a duodenal subepithelial tumor on preoperative upper GI endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography due to external compression of the GI wall. The patient had no symptoms, and his laboratory test results were normal. However, in a series of follow-up endoscopies, the tumor was found to have grown in size, so it was surgically resected. The lesion was completely removed by laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 without complications."
