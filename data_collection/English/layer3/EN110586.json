  "text": "A 63-year-old Korean woman was admitted to Pusan National University Hospital for an evaluation of abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes. Two weeks prior, she had presented to our hospital with proteinuria of approximately 1350 mg/d and hematuria and was diagnosed with IgAN. Autoimmune profiles were highly positive for antinuclear antibodies, and symptoms related to portal hypertension including ascites and peripheral edema were present. A diagnosis of AIH was made according to the simplified scoring system of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group. Despite immunosuppression with prednisolone and azathioprine, rapid deterioration of liver function led to end-stage liver disease. After a living-donor liver transplantation, liver function gradually improved, and she had maintained stable liver and kidney function at the six months follow-up."
