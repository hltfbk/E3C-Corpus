  "text": "We describe a 42-year-old male with CF who presented with 2â€‰days of worsening upper abdominal pain, emesis, and loss of bowel function. The patient had no history of any prior abdominal surgeries; however, imaging was concerning for high-grade mechanical small bowel obstruction possibly related to internal hernia. Given leukocytosis and diffusely tender abdomen found on further workup, the decision was made to proceed with diagnostic laparoscopy after a brief period of intravenous fluid resuscitation. Intraoperatively, the transition point was found in the mid-jejunum and was noted to be due to kinking of the bowel causing vascular congestion in the proximal portion. Surgical manipulation of the bowel was required for return of normal perfusion and patency."
