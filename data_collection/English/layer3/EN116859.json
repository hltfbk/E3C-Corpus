  "text": "The patient was a Japanese male born at 39 weeks of gestation. He was breast-fed and received commercial cow's milk supplementation starting the day of birth and was admitted to our hospital at 6 days of age due to bilious vomiting. Plain abdominal radiography showed a paucity of gas in the distal bowel. Because we demonstrated malpositioning of the intestine by barium enema, we repositioned the bowel in a normal position by laparotomy. The patient was re-started on only breast milk 2 days post surgery because we suspected the presence of a cow's milk allergy, and the results of an allergen-specific lymphocyte stimulation test showed a marked increase in lymphocyte response to kappa-casein. At 5 months of age, the patient was subjected to a cow's milk challenge test. After the patient began feeding on cow's milk, he had no symptoms and his laboratory investigations showed no abnormality. In addition, because the patient showed good weight gain and no symptoms with increased cow's milk intake after discharge, we concluded that the present case was not the result of a cow's milk allergy. At 1 year, the patient showed favorable growth and development, and serum allergy investigations revealed no reaction to cow's milk."
