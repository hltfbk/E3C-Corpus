  "text": "We diagnosed recurrent M. bovis epididymitis in a 63-year old Caucasian man without any signs of pulmonary or disseminated disease. Relevant epidemiological expositions included camel milk drinking during prolonged travels in Niger, prior to initial clinical manifestations. The diagnosis was firmly established by mass spectrometry and DNA sequencing on epididymis surgical biopsy specimens. We detail therapeutic management which included surgical epididymectomy and hydrocele repair."
