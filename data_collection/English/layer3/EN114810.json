  "text": "Here, we identified a FRG patient with urine glucose excretion 7.56 g/day and a novel SLC5A2 missense mutation, c.1891G > A/p.(E631K), by DNA sequencing. Expression and function of the mutant SGLT2 (631 K) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) were verified by western blotting, confocal laser microscopy, and transport activity assays in cultured HEK293 cells. Although wild-type SGLT2-GFP and 631 K mutant-GFP fusion proteins were properly expressed in a punctate pattern in the cell membrane, and co-localized with the cell membrane marker DiIC18(3), the expression of the mutant fusion protein was obviously decreased (24 %). Moreover, the uptake activity of the mutant SGLT2 631 K-GFP fusion protein was significantly decreased compared with wild-type (3629 ± 1082 vs. 7926 ± 1153, P < 0.001)."
