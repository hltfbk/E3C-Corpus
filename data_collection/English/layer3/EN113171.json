  "text": "During 2 years of denosumab therapy for osteoporosis in a 58-year-old female NF1 patient with prior fractures, BMD increased by 6.5% in the lumbar spine and 10.6% in the total hips, and bone turnover markers were notably improved. No fractures occurred during the latter half of treatment."
