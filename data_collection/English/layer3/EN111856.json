  "text": "A 21-year-old man was admitted to hospital for repeated cough for 2 mo and abdominal pain for 1 mo. Physical examination revealed multiple lymph nodes enlargement, especially those in the left neck and groin. CT scan showed multiple lymph nodes enlargement in the chest, especially left lung, abdominal cavity, and retroperitoneum. The first lymph node biopsy revealed granulomatous lesions of lymph nodes, so intravenous infusion of Cefoperazone tazobactam combined with anti-tuberculosis drugs were given. Because fever and respiratory failure occurred 4 d after admission, mechanical ventilation was given, and Caspofungin and Voriconazole were used successively. However, the disease still could not be controlled. On the 11th day of admission, the body temperature reached 40Â° C. After mycosis of lymph nodes was confirmed by the second lymph node biopsy, Amphotericin B was given, and the patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital."
