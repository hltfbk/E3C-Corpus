  "text": "An 89-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital following an episode of general fatigue, nausea, muscle weakness of the lower limbs, and ophthalmoplegia. On urinalysis, proteinuria, hematuria, and cellular casts were observed. Elevated levels of serum creatinine and C-reactive protein were also demonstrated, and MPO-, PR3- and azurocidin-ANCA were detected on serological examination. Renal biopsy showed pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. We therefore diagnosed rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis due to microscopic polyangiitis. Acetylcholine-receptor antibody was also detected. Chest computed tomography and MRI revealed a lobulated tumor in the anterior mediastinum. We thus also diagnosed myasthenia gravis with thymoma."
