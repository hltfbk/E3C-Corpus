  "text": "A 61-year-old Caucasian man was treated for a synchronous urothelial tumor of the bladder and left renal pelvis. He had an en bloc radical cystectomy and left ureteronehprectomy associated with a cutaneous transileal urinary diversion and lymph node dissection. He was scheduled for chemotherapy but was lost to follow-up. He consulted 1 year later with growing skin tumors that were confirmed to be metastatic disease, and he was referred to the oncology department for palliative chemotherapy."
