  "text": "We present a case report of a 33 year old Caucasian man with relapsing disease complicated by pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium abscessus. He subsequently required bilateral cochlear implantation for progressive sensori-neural hearing loss. His M. abscessus was treated successfully with a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy. His Granulomatosis with polyangitis (Wegener's) relapsed towards the end of antimicrobial therapy and required treatment. Shortly after completing his antimicrobial therapy and relapse, he developed progressive dyspnea due to pulmonary fibrosis."
