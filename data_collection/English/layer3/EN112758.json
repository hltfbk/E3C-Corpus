  "text": "We report the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian male patient with bilateral tophaceous gout to his knees involving the soft tissue and ulcerating skin breakdown to his left knee after an acute traumatic injury. Plain radiographs of the bilateral knees revealed large soft tissue masses anterior to the patella. Magnetic resonance imaging of the left knee was also performed which demonstrated heterogeneous masses consistent with tophi and peripheral enhancement with central necrosis. A diagnostic biopsy was performed to rule out malignancy the results confirmed gouty tophi. We report this case to note the atypical presentation of this disease."
