  "text": "A 25-year-old Nigerian African presented with recurrent huge fibrosarcoma measuring about 55 x 40 x 10 cm at his posterior trunk. The patient's clinical condition was poor; the tumour seemed unresectable and the patient looked inoperable. He had an extensive excision of the tumour but could not afford adjuvant therapies. He was discharged home against medical advice but may succumb to metastases."
