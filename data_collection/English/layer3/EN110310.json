  "text": "A 54 years old male, with no medical history but an active smoking, was admitted to the emergency department (ED) after a single motor vehicle crash. On admission, the patient complained of vague chest and shoulder pain. Physical examination revealed an alert, hemodynamically stable patient. Cardiac examination revealed regular heart rhythm with no murmur nor pericardial rubs. A tenderness of the right collarbone and a bilaterally diminished breath sounds were noted. Radiologic workup revealed a bilateral pleural effusion, a fracture of the right collarbone, a hepatic contusion, a right adrenal hematoma and a fracture of the left iliac wing. The ECG showed an ST-segment elevation in the precordial leads, with Q waves in V1, V2, V3 and V4. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed an anterior, anteroseptal and inferoseptal akinesis, as well as moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF: 40%) and no pericardial effusion. Laboratory tests result demonstrated a rhabdomyolysis and positive troponins (Troponin Ic: 0.78 ng/mL). Given the hemorrhagic risk, antiplatelet therapy wasn't initiated. We started prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (DVP/PE), proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and enteral nutrition. Fractures were treated orthopedically. As for the abdominal injuries, no specific treatment was needed. The patient was closely monitored in the cardiac intensive care unit. Three days after his admission, the patient presented an upper gastrointestinal bleeding, secondary to an ulcerative bulbitis and congestive gastritis, which we treated by intensifying the PPI, transfusion of packed red blood cells and a Helicobacter pylori eradication protocol with favorable evolution. A TTE revealed two intraventricular thrombi afterward. Given the important thrombotic risk, in consultation with the intensive care specialists and gastroenterologists, therapeutic anticoagulation was started. Initially, the patient was given unfractionated heparin, then, once we have been reassured concerning the absence of hemorrhagic diathesis, we switched to Low molecular weight heparin and vitamin K antagonist. Meanwhile, we performed a coronary angiography (CAG) that revealed an occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery within an atheromatous coronary network."
