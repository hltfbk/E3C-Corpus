  "text": "A 40-year-old male was referred to our hospital due to the detection of a submucosal tumor at the distal esophagus. The tumor was found during gastroendoscopy in a general health check-up. The patient had no symptoms. A benign esophageal tumor was confirmed by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and computed tomography (CT). On the basis of these results, ESTD was performed. During the procedure, a cystic mass was observed between the mucosa and the muscular layers of the esophagus, and a hybrid knife was used for dissection. Histopathological examination showed the cyst wall was lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium, consistent with a bronchogenic cyst. The esophagography using meglumine diatrizoate showed no leakage on the seventh day after ESTD. The patient remained asymptomatic and had a regular diet during the follow-up period."
