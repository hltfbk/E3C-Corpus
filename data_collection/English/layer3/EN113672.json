  "text": "This report describes a 51-year-old man who presented with epigastric pain at our hospital. According to contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), he was diagnosed with a ruptured right gastric artery aneurysm and celiac artery stenosis caused by the median arcuate ligament (MAL). He had a vascular anomaly of the common hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). His vital signs were stable. We informed him of the situation and he chose open surgery rather than endovascular treatment. Following, we resected the aneurysm and transected the MAL. Intraoperative angiography after transection of the MAL showed the antegrade blood flow to the splenic artery instead of the retrograde flow via the prominent collaterals. Follow-up CT confirmed narrowed collateral vessels between the SMA and the celiac artery without de-novo aneurysms."
