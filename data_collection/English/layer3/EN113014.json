  "text": "We report a 55-year-old man with unresectable PDC with liver and nodal metastases responding to systemic chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX). His metastatic lesions completely disappeared by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography after six courses of XELOX. Then, he underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with lymph node dissection and partial resection of the liver. Postoperatively, the histological effect was determined to be grade 3, and the patient was diagnosed as having achieved pathological complete response (pCR). He is disease-free with no evidence of metastatic lesion for 14Â months after surgery. Conversion surgery allowed R0 resection for unresectable PDC, and pCR can be achieved with XELOX treatment."
