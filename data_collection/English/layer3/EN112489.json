  "text": "A healthy 10-year-old male patient was referred to the Radiological Department of our Institution due to no evidence of left coronary artery in echocardiographic examination. With C-MRI was detected marked myocardial trabeculation and was suspected anomalous origin and course of left circumflex (LCx) artery and of left anterior descending (LAD) artery. With third generation Dual Source C-CT 192x2-sections (SOMATOM Force, Siemens, Germany) was confirmed anomalous origin of LCx artery from right pulmonary artery associated with anomalous origin of LAD artery from right coronary artery with course in front of right ventricular outflow tract. The patient underwent surgical treatment with reimplantation of the anomalous LCX and LAD arteries into the wall of ascending aorta, with no postoperative complications. The patient remained asymptomatic and follow-up C-MRI scan four months after operation showed complete success of surgery treatment."
