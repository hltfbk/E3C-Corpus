  "text": "A 63-year-old male farmer of Chinese Han ethnicity presented to us with pain in left side of the neck, right side of the chest and the back for 10Â months without typical tuberculosis symptoms. His past medical history, the CT and fluoroscopy-guided biopsy were negative for tuberculosis. Interferon gamma by T-SPOT was also negative. Radiological findings including CT, MRI and PET-CT suggested that the patient had multiple metastases. Accordingly, the patient was misdiagnosed as having musculoskeletal tumors until a swelling under the right nipple ulcerated. The smear test for acid-fast bacilli and the PCR test for TB-DNA of the pus from the swollen area were both positive, leading to the final correct diagnosis of musculoskeletal tuberculosis."
