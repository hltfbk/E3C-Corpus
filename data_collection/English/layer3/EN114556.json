  "text": "A 23-year-old female, gravida 1, para 0, underwent a laparoscopic salpingectomy for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Surgical time was 90Â min. Postoperatively, the patient developed acute compartment syndrome of both legs necessitating emergent bilateral four-compartment fasciotomies, with repeated returns to the operating room for 2nd look procedures and delayed wound closures. The patient regained full function within 3 months and returned to an unrestricted baseline activity level."
