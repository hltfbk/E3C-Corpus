  "text": "We report the clinical and radiologic findings of a calcaneal osteochondroma with an extremely rare placement and painfull, rapid reccurence following surgical excision in a skeletally mature female. The lesion showed growth the first-operation later and was re-operated. Histopathological examination did not show malignancy."
