  "text": "This is a case report and review of the literature. We present a patient with long standing severe psoriasis vulgaris with marked thrombocytosis. His thrombocytosis did not correlate with disease severity but rather with the different treatments that he was exposed to, subsiding only during treatment with anti Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)- agents. A literature review revealed that in rheumatoid arthritis, another systemic inflammatory disease; interleukin (IL)-6 might be implicated in causing thrombocytosis."
