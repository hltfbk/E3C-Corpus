  "text": "A 44-year-old woman presented to the infectious department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Beijing) in August 2013, with a 7-week history of fevers, chills, sore throat, muscular soreness, occasional joint pain, and cough. The organism obtained by blood culture, identified as H. massiliensis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, was finally implicated as the cause of infectious endocarditis. The patient was cured with amoxicillin/clavulanate combined with amikacin for 6Â weeks."
