  "text": "A 45-year-old woman was referred to our Nuclear Department with a palpable neck nodule suspicious for parathyroid adenoma. She had no significant medical history or other accompanying symptoms. Blood examination results were normal with the exception of the parathormone level which was high at 167.2 pg/ml. Neck ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic mass near the lower pole of the thyroid gland. 99m Tc-tetrofosmin dual-phase scintigraphy with early and delayed images was performed and the results supported the presupposition of parathyroid adenoma as shown by increased radiopharmaceutical levels near the lower left thyroid gland on the early image that disappeared on the delayed image. Moreover, TcO4- thyroid scintigraphy results excluded thyroid pathology. Two months after the diagnosis, parathyroidectomy was successfully performed without postoperative complications. The pathology report and clinical response to a gradual decrease of parathormone confirmed the initial diagnosis."
