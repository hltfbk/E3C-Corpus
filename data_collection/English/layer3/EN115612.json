  "text": "A 53-year-old Japanese man with tinnitus visited our hospital. His initial best-corrected visual acuity in either eye was not impaired, although they both exhibited papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging did not reveal a mass or hemorrhagic lesion in our patient's brain. Nevertheless, his best-corrected visual acuity gradually deteriorated over the following three months. Angiography demonstrated a dural arteriovenous fistula in his sigmoid sinus. After embolization therapy, the papilledema improved in both eyes. However, over the subsequent four years, his best-corrected visual acuity progressively deteriorated due to an unknown cause, despite the successful embolization of the dural arteriovenous fistula."
