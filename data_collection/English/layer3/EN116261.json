  "text": "A 25-year-old female reported with severe headache, suspected to be migraine, and was started on TPM 25 mg/day on the first day. However, she presented at the emergency clinic of a hospital with sudden blurring of vision and colored halos 5 days after stopping the drug, i.e., day 8. She was subjected to ophthalmic examination and was diagnosed with AACG. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was found to be elevated and she was hence started on acetazolamide 500 mg instantly, maintained on tablet acetazolamide 250 mg four times a day (QID), pilocarpine 2% eye drops QID, travoprost 0.004% once a day (OD), and dorzolamide 2% eye drops three times a day (TID). After a week's treatment, there was rapid improvement with return of IOP to normal."
