  "text": "Herein, we report a 67-year-old HIV/HHV-8-negative Caucasian iMCD patient diagnosed with TAFRO. He presented with marked systemic inflammation, bicytopenia, terminal renal insufficiency, diffuse lymphadenopathies, and anasarca. Lymph node and bone marrow biopsies revealed atrophic germinal centers variably hyalinized and megakaryocytic hyperplasia with mild myelofibrosis. Several other biopsies performed in kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, prostate, and lungs revealed unspecific chronic inflammation. The patient had a complete response to corticosteroids, tocilizumab, and rituximab. He relapsed twice following discontinuation of rituximab. When reviewing the literature, we found seven other Caucasian cases with TAFRO syndrome. There were no significant differences with those described by the Japanese cohort except for the higher frequency of kidney failure and auto-antibodies in Western patients."
