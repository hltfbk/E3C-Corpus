  "text": "We report on a Tanzanian male infant, who developed blood-stained stool when feeding fresh cow's milk at the age of three months. After an initial diagnosis of amoebiasis, possible cow's milk protein allergy was suspected. Further diagnostic work-up was not possible due to lack of resources. After elimination of cow's milk from the diet, the infant recovered soon."
