  "text": "A 75-year-old Japanese woman presented with nephrotic syndrome, microhematuria and renal insufficiency. Renal biopsy revealed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with IgM and weak C3 deposition. Congo red stain was negative. Electron microscopy demonstrated massive fibrils in the subendothelium, mesangium and subepithelium. The fibrils were partially parallel, partially curved and 17Â nm in diameter. Cryoglobulin, hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigen, hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody or antinuclear antibody were negative."
