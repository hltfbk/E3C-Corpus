  "text": "A 62-year old man with IIIA-N2 inoperable NSCLC was treated with first-line single agent docetaxel. A platinum-based treatment, though considered more active, was ruled out because of renal impairment. The patient tolerated the treatment very well and, although his initial response was not impressive, after 14 cycles he obtained a complete clinical response, which was confirmed pathologically after he underwent surgical lobectomy."
