  "text": "A 45-year-old male patient presented with left flank pain for 1 year and irradiated to the mesogastric region. He denied fever, vomiting, and any other intestinal changes. He reported a weight loss of 10 kg in a period of 7 mo. He denied alcoholism, smoking, drug use, or prior illness. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed in the gallbladder fossa a voluminous mesogastric heterogeneous collection that had a thick and irregular capsule with liquid and gaseous contents. A predominantly hypoattenuating rounded material with partially calcified margins measuring about 2.0 cm related to gallstone was also emphasized. No lymphadenomegalies or free fluid was observed in the abdominal cavity. Patient underwent laparotomy where a huge tumor was observed affecting the transverse colon and gallbladder. This mass was resected en bloc removing gallbladder and transverse colon together with corresponding mesocolon and regional lymphadenectomy. There were no complications in the postoperative period. Although oncological treatment was performed, the patient died 6 mo after surgery."
