  "text": "A 66-year-old man with alcohol-related liver injury visited our hospital for endoscopy for investigation of varix. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed no varix but a large epiphrenic diverticulum with an area of fainted redness just above the esophagogastric junction. Narrow band imaging revealed a sharply demarcated brownish dotted area, and dilated intra-epithelial papillary capillary loops (IPCL) were subsequently seen after magnification. Chromoendoscopy with 1% Lugol's iodine solution demonstrated a well-demarcated unstained area, approximately 20Â mm in diameter. Endoscopic biopsy revealed a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)."
