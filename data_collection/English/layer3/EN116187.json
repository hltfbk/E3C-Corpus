  "text": "In one Omani family, a 15-year-old girl of Arabian origin was pre-diagnosed with resistance to thyroid hormone. Blood sample was collected and deoxyribonucleic acid was isolated for molecular genetic testing. The results revealed a rare mutation A268G in the gene for thyroid hormone receptor beta. We believe that this mutation is the cause of the pathology in our patient."
