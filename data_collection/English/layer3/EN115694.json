  "text": "The case subject was 55 years old, male, mulatto, and an assistant surveyor residing in Teresina, Piauí. He presented with headache, seizures, confusion, fever and left hemiparesis upon hospitalization in 2006 at Hospital São Marcos. Five years previously, he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, and 17 months previously he had acne margined by hyperpigmented areas and was diagnosed with leprosy. Laboratory tests indicated leukocytosis and magnetic resonance imaging showed an infarction in the right cerebral hemisphere. Cerebrospinal fluid examination showed 120 cells/mm(3) and was alcohol-resistant bacilli negative. Trans-sphenoidal surgery with biopsy showed inflammation was caused by infection with Aspergillus fumigatus. We initiated use of parenteral amphotericin B, but his condition worsened. He underwent another surgery to implant a reservoir of Ommaya-Hickmann, a subcutaneous catheter. We started liposomal amphotericin B 5 mg/kg in the reservoir on alternate days. He was discharged with a prescription of tegretol and fluconazole."
