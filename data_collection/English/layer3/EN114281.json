  "text": "A 65-year-old male patient with no known medical conditions presented with severe chronic localized periodontitis and a combined periodontal-endodontic lesion affecting three first molars. Initial ridge preservation and lateral window sinus augmentation resulted in incomplete bone formation and complex sinus floor anatomy on both right and left sides. A dilating balloon technique on one side and a palatal approach on the other side were utilized for additional sinus augmentation using particulate allograft and resorbable collagen membranes. Healing was uneventful, and implants could be placed and restored at all sites. Periodontal maintenance was conducted every 3 months, and the implants have been in function and periodontally healthy for 2 years."
