  "text": "We report a case of oncocytic carcinoma arising in the parotid gland of a 65-year-old Caucasian man. Our patient initially underwent left superficial parotidectomy, including the removal of the mass. A close follow-up was made, and four years after first surgery cervical lymph node metastases were confirmed. Therefore, a complete parotidectomy and radical neck dissections were performed. There were no complications and no sign of recurrence after six months of follow-up."
