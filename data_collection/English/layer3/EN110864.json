  "text": "We present a case of four-year- and eight-month-old male child with anicteric hepatitis A infection associated with a pleural effusion. The patient presented with abdominal pain, low-grade fever, loss of appetite, and vomiting of ten days duration. On examination, there was dullness and decreased air entry on the lower third of the lung field bilaterally and hepatomegaly of 6 cm below the costal margin. Ultrasonography revealed mild ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, and small bilateral pleural effusion. Immunoglobulin M anti-hepatitis A virus serology was positive. He was managed with supportive treatment and fully recovered after a month of follow-up. This case is reported to emphasize that hepatitis A infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pleural effusion in a patient with acute hepatitis even in the absence of jaundice. This is the first case of anicteric hepatitis A infection complicated with pleural effusion in children."
