  "text": "The patient presented with a fix scotoma and decrease in visual acuity for 2 weeks in his left eye. Ocular examination revealed that his best-corrected visual acuity was 0.6 in right eye and 0.2 in left eye. The patient had amblyopia because of hyperopia with spherical equivalent of +11.75 diopters in the right eye and +12.00 diopters in the left eye. The axial lengths were 18.41 mm in right and 18.43 mm in left eyes respectively. Slip lamp examination found normal anterior segments. Funduscopy showed bilateral retinoschisis in inferotemporal retina. The schisis in right eye was limited to peripheral retina whereas the schisis in left eye was bullous type. The schisis in the left eye extended from the periphery to the posterior macular region in left eye. A pars plana vitrectomy was performed in the left eye and visual acuity was restored to 0.6."
