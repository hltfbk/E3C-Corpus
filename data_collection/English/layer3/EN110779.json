  "text": "We present four patients with noninfectious mixed (type 2 or 3) CGN and MGUS. Two patients had type 2 cryoglobulinaemia, one had type 3 cryoglobulinaemia, and one lacked definitive typing of the serum cryoprecipitate. The serum monoclonal band was IgM-κ in all four cases. Treatments included corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, plasma exchange, and rituximab. At median 3.5 years' follow-up, no patient had developed a haematological malignancy or advanced chronic kidney disease. Other potential causes of mixed cryoglobulinaemia were also present in our cohort, notably primary Sjögren's syndrome in three cases."
