  "text": "Our case, is a 26-year-old female, by the chief complaint of headache, vomiting, fever and arthralgia. Some hemorrhagic ulcers in her mouth with fulminant pethechia/purpura on her limbs and buttocks were prominent. On admission, she was in hypotensive state. By the clinical suspicion to meningococcal septicemia, lumbar puncture was performed, and antibiotic therapy was started. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. Suddenly, on the 3rd day of admission, hemorrhagic bullae were evolved from those purpuric lesions. Leukocytosis, immune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and high antinuclear antibody/double stranded DNA level and hypocomplemania were present simultaneously. In skin biopsy, immune complex deposition in dermoepidermal junction was seen. The diagnosis of Systemic lupus Erythematosus was made. The patient responded well to corticosteroid therapy."
