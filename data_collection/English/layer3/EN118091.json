  "text": "A 73-year-old cachectic Asian man (Iranian) presented with a general feeling of being unwell and an acute loss of vision in his left eye accompanied by a severe headache. A Tc-99 m-methylene diphosphonate bone scan demonstrated multiple regions of intense activity in the appendicular and axial skeleton, suggesting metastatic involvement. Tumor markers (PSA, CA125, CA 19-9 and AFP) were within normal ranges. Based on clinical presentation and laboratory, radiological and scintigraphic findings, a presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis was made. Quadruple antituberculous chemotherapy was consequently started and the patient later showed marked improvement."
