  "text": "A 59-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for palpitations and edema of the lower extremity. Computed tomography image and transthoracic echocardiography showed a 57 mm × 63 mm giant tumor obstructing the tricuspid valve inflow. The tumor was excised surgically and the residual septal defect was repaired with a Dacron patch. Tricuspid valve annuloplasty was performed additionally. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 5."
