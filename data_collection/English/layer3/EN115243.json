  "text": "A 58-year-old Japanese woman presented with a 3-month history of progressive muscle weakness and numbness of the lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography showed a calcified spinal cord tumor with dural tail sign at the T10-T11 level, severely compressing the spinal cord anterolaterally. The patient underwent en-bloc resection of the tumor with the inner layer of the dura and preservation of the outer layer of the dura through recapping T-saw laminoplasty of T10-T11, including bilateral facet joints. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as meningioma. Postoperatively, the patient achieved complete recovery of neurological functions. Bone union after laminoplasty was obtained within 6 months. Follow-up MRI at 5 years postoperatively demonstrated no recurrence of the tumor."
