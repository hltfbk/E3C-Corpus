  "text": "We present a case of a 24-year-old female with a subacute thumb MCP joint subluxation due to an incarcerated radial sesamoid. She underwent successful closed reduction but had persistent pain and difficulty gripping large objects necessitating eventual open volar plate repair despite therapy. She was able to achieve full motion, with little pain and disability, after undergoing delayed volar plate repair."
