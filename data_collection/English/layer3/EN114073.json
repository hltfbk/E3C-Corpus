  "text": "A 63-year-old man with syphilis had Charcot joint of the right knee. The patient developed severe varus deformity and contracture and experienced severe pain in the knee. TKA was performed to alleviate the pain and improve the patient's gait. The patient noticed slight heel pain 4 weeks after the TKA, and a calcaneus avulsion fracture in the ipsilateral foot was diagnosed without any trauma 1 week later. Open reduction internal fixation was performed with cannulated cancellous screws and a cerclage wire. 3 weeks after the surgery, partial weight bearing was permitted in an orthotic device. Full weight-bearing was allowed at 7 weeks after surgery. The surgical wounds healed without complications. The calcaneus fracture successfully achieved bone union with appropriate surgical intervention and aftercare."
