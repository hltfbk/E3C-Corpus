  "text": "This report describes the case of a 5-month-old female infant with a large mass measuring 26 × 22 mm in the right ventricle cured successfully with surgery. Physical examination revealed a harsh S1 sound and a grade IV systolic murmur on the left sternal border. Surgical resection was indicated due to severe right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and further follow-up evaluation was uneventful."
