  "text": "Here, we report an unusual case of ARMS confined to the bone marrow in an older adult that lacked an identifiable primary tumour using FDG-PET/CT and mimicked a haematological disease with pancytopenia but without abnormal findings by FDG-PET/CT. The patient was initially treated with topotecan/cyclophosphamide and subsequently switched to vinorelbine. Due to severe toxicity the treatment was discontinued, however after 7-months follow-up, the patient is still alive with an improved general state of health and only a mild pancytopenia with no need for blood transfusions."
