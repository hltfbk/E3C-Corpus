  "text": "We report a rare case of Pipkin Type III fracture after attempted hip relocation and review literature on this topic. A 35-year-old female sustained a right posterior hip dislocation with femoral head fracture following a fall. After attempts of manipulation and reduction, she sustained an iatrogenic right femoral neck fracture resulting in a Pipkin III femoral head fracture. Open reduction and reduction of fracture achieved through headless compression screw of femoral head and cortical screws of femoral neck. Four months after surgery, the patient under osteonecrosis of the femoral head and subsequently required conversion to a right total hip arthroplasty."
