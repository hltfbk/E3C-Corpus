  "text": "A retrospective case review of a 66 year old male who presented with diminution of vision in right eye 17 days after uneventful cataract surgery was done. Visual acuity in this eye was 20/200 at presentation. DMD was noted 3 days later (approximately 3 weeks post-operatively) and Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography & Scheimpflug imaging were done in view of diffuse corneal edema. Pneumatic descemetopexy was attempted thrice (twice with SF6, once with air) over a week's span with limited success at re-attaching the DM. Finally, corneal venting incision with air tamponade was done resulting in egress of supra-descemet's fluid and DM appeared apposed to stroma. Bandage contact lens (BCL) was applied at the end of the procedure. DM was seen attached the next day. Corneal edema cleared completely in 1 week. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 6 weeks follow-up was 20/30."
