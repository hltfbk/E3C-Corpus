  "text": "A 70 year old gentleman was admitted with right iliac fossa pain, tenderness, and raised inflammatory markers. A computed tomography scan of his abdomen showed an appendix mass with a small abscess and a linear opaque foreign body. His symptoms resolved completely on conservative management with intravenous antibiotics. A colonoscopy few weeks later was unremarkable. He presented with recurrent symptoms a few months later. A repeat computed tomography scan showed persistent appendicular abscess with the same foreign body in it. A laparotomy with appendicectomy, abscess drainage and removal of the foreign body was carried out with satisfactory outcome."
