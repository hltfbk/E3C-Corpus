  "text": "We experienced a case of a 47-yo woman with recent history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosed with endometrial cancer, initially suspected to have metastasized to pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes based on preoperative diagnostic imaging. Subsequent pathological diagnosis revealed stage IB endometrial cancer without evidence of lymph node involvement. Instead, enlarged pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes were found to be due to extrapulmonary LAM, from a primary lesion found inside the uterine myometrium. SLE improved after surgery."
