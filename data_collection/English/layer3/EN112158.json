  "text": "An 87-year-old woman with a history of multiple cardiovascular diseases was diagnosed with obstructive descending colon cancer and initially underwent colonic stenting. However, as preoperative echocardiography revealed severe AS, she underwent TAVI prior to the colectomy to reduce perioperative risk. TAVI was chosen instead of SAVR due to high SAVR mortality risk, and laparoscopic colectomy was performed 22 days after TAVI. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged 14 days later without any deterioration in general condition. No recurrence was observed at more than 1 year, even without adjuvant therapy."
