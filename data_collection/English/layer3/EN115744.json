  "text": "We report a case of a 68-year-old CKD5 patient who had difficulty in hemodialysis treatment because of severe fluctuations in blood pressure with hypertensive attacks and hypotensive episodes which caused him a severe discomfort. His dialysis treatment was started in 2010 and since that time baroreflex failure syndrome has been suspected because of his clinical manifestations and history of radiotherapy in the cervical region for his lingual cancer in 1994. Baroreflex failure syndrome is diagnosed by symptoms and cold stressor test. We performed a cold stressor test on an experimental baroreflex failure syndrome mouse and induced a significant elevation of blood pressure. From this experimental finding of model mouse, we changed the patients dialysate temperature between 34-38Â° according to his change in blood pressure though 80-240 mmHg. From this attempt, his blood pressure was successfully controlled between 100-180 mmHg and he was able to continue hemodialysis without any discomfort."
