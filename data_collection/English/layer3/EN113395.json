  "text": "This report describes three cases of reconstruction of large oroantral defects, all of which were covered by a pedicled buccal fat pad. Follow-up photography and radiologic imaging showed successful closure of the oroantral defects. Furthermore, there were no operative site complications, and no patient reported postsurgical discomfort."
