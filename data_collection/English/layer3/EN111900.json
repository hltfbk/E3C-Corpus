  "text": "We describe the case of a patient who underwent a pelvic exenteration and radiation therapy due to a local recurrence of rectal cancer. The initially used VRAM flap could not ensure a satisfactorily wound closure. An interdisciplinary approach first yielded an AV loop using both greater saphenous veins and was connected to the arteria and vena femoris followed by a free LDF transfer, which was performed 11 days later. The result was an excellent reconstructive and plastic coverage of the sacral wound defect with a well-perfused LDF. The long-term result showed a perfectly integrated flap in the sacral region."
