  "text": "Our patient was a 27-year-old Han Chinese woman who sought treatment because of a menstrual disorder and hirsutism. Tests showed that her levels of insulin and testosterone were elevated, and gynecological color Doppler ultrasound suggested multiple cystic changes in the bilateral ovaries. After a diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome was made, pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy and metformin were administered, but the patient's symptoms did not improve in 1 year of follow-up. Considering that the previous diagnosis might have been incorrect, venous blood samples were collected from the patient and her relatives for genetic analysis. Subsequently, using Illumina sequencing, it was found that the proband, her father, and two brothers all had the c.3601C>T heterozygous missense mutation in exon 20 of the insulin receptor gene. The diagnosis was corrected to type A insulin resistance syndrome, and the patient's treatment was modified."
