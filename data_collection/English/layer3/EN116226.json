  "text": "We describe a case of a 57-year-old Japanese woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer stage IV metastasized to multiple organs including liver and lung. After she received 3 regimens, she showed evidence of brain metastases, and whole brain radiation therapy was performed. Lapatinib and capecitabine was then administered as fourth-line chemotherapy, but the patient was hospitalized due to the exacerbation of interstitial pneumonitis and progression of brain and liver metastases. To control the systemic disease, eribulin was commenced as fifth-line chemotherapy. One month later, a significant response of brain metastases had been achieved, and this response has persisted for the last 4 months. We now describe a remarkable antitumor effect of eribulin against brain metastases from breast cancer. This case is the first report which indicates potential treatment of brain metastases using this medication."
