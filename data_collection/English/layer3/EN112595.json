  "text": "We present a 72-year-old man with arterial hypertension in connection with which he is taking Irbesartan 300 mg (1-0-0), Amlodipine 5 mg (0-0-1) and Moxonidine 0.2 mg (0-0-1). The patient reported the presence of pigment lesion in the head area, which dates from many years and 3 years ago it was at the size of the nail plate on the index finger. Irbesartan therapy dates from 1.5-2 years, and according to the patient 1.5-2 years after the start of irbesartan therapy, the lesion grew sixfold, accompanied by sensitivity and discomfort in the area. Clinically and dermatoscopically the lesion had data on superficial spreading cutaneous melanoma. Tumour thickness â‰¤ 1 mm was measured preoperatively by ultrasound. The so-called one-step melanoma surgery (OSMS) was performed, and the lesion was removed by elliptical excision with an operative surgical margin of 1 cm in all directions within one operative session. The subsequent histological study (and screening staging) found that it was a superficial spreading melanoma stage IA (T1bN0M0)."
