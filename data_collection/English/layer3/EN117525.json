  "text": "We report the case of a 55-year-old Greek woman with a solid pseudopapillary tumor of the tail of the pancreas. She underwent a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The histopathologic examination finally revealed a cystic-solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas. Solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas are rare and affect predominantly young women. These tumors are of unclear pathogenesis and low malignancy, and surgical resection offers an excellent chance for long-term survival."
