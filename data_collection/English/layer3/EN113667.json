  "text": "We present the case of a 52-year-old woman who experienced a traumatic thyroid gland rupture (right lobe) with subsequent active arterial bleeding from branches of the inferior thyroid artery. On the same day, the patient presented to our emergency department with a painful swelling of the neck with an inspiratory stridor and hoarseness a few hours after a cycling accident. A right hemithyroidectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. We identified 33 additional cases published in English literature within the last 30Â years, reporting blunt trauma to the neck with hemorrhagic complication of the thyroid gland. We provide a systematic review and particularly consider the aspects of endocrine surgery."
