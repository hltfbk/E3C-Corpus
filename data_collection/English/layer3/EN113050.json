  "text": "This report describes three unrelated patients with MAFB mutations, including two male and one female patient. Osteolytic lesions in the carpal and tarsal bones were detected at 2 years, 12 years, and 14 months of age, respectively. Associated proteinuria was noted at 4 years, 12 years, and 3 months of age, respectively. Kidney biopsy was performed in two of them and revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). One patient showed progression to end-stage renal disease, that is by 1 year after the detection of proteinuria. The second patient had persistent proteinuria but maintained normal renal function. In the third patient, who did not undergo a kidney biopsy, the proteinuria disappeared spontaneously. The bony lesions worsened progressively in all three patients. Mutational study of MAFB revealed three different mutations, two novel mutations [c.183C > A (p.Ser61Arg) and c.211C > G (p.Pro71Ala)] and one known mutation [c.212C > T (p.Pro71Leu)]."
