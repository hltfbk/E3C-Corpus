  "text": "We report the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian woman with bleeding gastric varices secondary to splenic vein thrombosis treated by splenic artery embolization. Successful embolization was performed by depositing coils into the splenic artery resulting in cessation of variceal bleeding. After embolization there was no recurrence of bleeding."
