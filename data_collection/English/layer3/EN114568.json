  "text": "A 35-year-old woman presented with waist pain for over 1 month. The biopsy of soft tissue lesions showed that these cells were positive for ALK-1, CD30, TIA-1, GranzymeB, CD4, CD8, and Ki67 (90%+) and negative for CD3, CD5, CD20, CD10, cytokeratin (CK), TdT, HMB-45, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), and pan-CK, which identified ALCL. After six cycles of Hyper-CVAD/MA regimen, she achieved partial remission. Three months later, she died due to disease progression."
