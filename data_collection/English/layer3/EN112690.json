  "text": "The two patients were referred to the hospital after 1) finding a cavity in their tooth with a color change and, 2) a toothache during mastication, respectively. Both of these cases were diagnosed as apical periodontitis by X-ray imaging and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). Non-surgical endodontic therapy was performed with the assistance of a dental operating microscope (DOM). CBCT showed rare but accurate images of both patients, each with two root canals and two roots in their maxillary first molars. Both roots were located in the buccal in the palatal direction, and each root had only one clear root canal. In addition, each maxillary first molar in both patients was symmetrical to that on the opposing side with only two separate root canals. Non-surgical endodontic therapy was performed with the assistance of a DOM. Finally, the teeth were restored using composite resin and the patients were satisfied with the results."
