  "text": "A 51-year-old man was referred to our hospital with hematemesis. Gastroscopy revealed a submucosal-like tumor on the posterior wall of gastric angle with ulceration. Computed tomography indicated a tumor measuring 65 × 50 mm in the stomach, which was suspected to have invaded into the pancreas. Significant hematemesis recurred; the patient developed shock and underwent emergency distal gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy, and splenectomy. The pathology and the clinical course were compatible with SAM splenic artery rupture causing retroperitoneal hemorrhage that penetrated into the stomach. After that surgery, aneurysm of common hepatic artery ruptured and coil embolization was performed."
