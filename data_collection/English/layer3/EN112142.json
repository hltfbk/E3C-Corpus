  "text": "We report a rare case of a middle-aged woman that presented with a tumor arising from the right tensor fasciae latae muscle. The patient initially opted for traditional Chinese herbal treatment, which we believe, aggravated the growth of the tumor. Radiographic imaging showed clear tumor margins. The histopathological biopsy of the lesion located in the tensor fasciae latae muscle showed a mixture of mononucleated and multinuclear giant cells composed of mesenchyme spindle-shaped cells positive for CD34 and CD88. The patient was treated through surgical resection of the tumor and scheduled for close follow-up."
