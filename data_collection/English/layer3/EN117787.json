  "text": "A 39-year-old Caucasian man presented with severe necrotic pancreatitis that failed multiple aggressive attempts to control associated bleeding with electrocautery, suture ligation, and sequential anatomic packing with cotton-based sponges. Subsequent retroperitoneal packing with Stasilon(R) produced a non-adherent wound-dressing interface and resulted in the achievement of persistent hemostasis in the operative field."
