  "text": "A 14-year-old Asian girl was referred to our hospital after slipping down with pain on the left knee. A radiograph showed an abnormal finding of a central radiolucent lesion with a marginal sclerotic border near the proximal tibial spine. A magnetic resonance image showed the lesion at low signal intensity on a T1-weighted image and at high signal intensity on a T2-weighted image. The biopsy results led us to conclude that the lesion was a fibrous dysplasia."
