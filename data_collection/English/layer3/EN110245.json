  "text": "A twenty-eight-year-old male patient was admitted in our outside hospital's emergency room after 12 hours of evolution of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. There was no history of previous abdominal surgery. Blood analysis was unremarkable. He referred a similar episode several months ago that ceased spontaneously. An abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast demonstrated an encapsulated cluster of small bowel loops occupying mainly the right upper quadrant, lateral to the duodenum, suspicious for an internal hernia in the context of an intestinal malrotation. There was a portion of bowel with less enhancement of contrast and associated mesenteric oedema, suggesting bowel suffering. The patient underwent a laparotomy, which revealed a large sac containing dilated small bowel loops as shown by radiologic studies with suffering signs. Immediately after the liberation of the bowel inside the hernia, it recovered its normal aspect. The peritoneum of Treitz's angle was too lax and baggy and so, in order to avoid recurrences of the hernia, we decided to open it and make a plicature over itself and to the preaórtic retroperitoneum. The patient did well in postoperatory and was discharged home on the fourth day after the surgery. In a year follow up the patient remained asymptomatic."
