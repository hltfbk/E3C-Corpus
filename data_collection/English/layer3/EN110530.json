  "text": "Case N°1: 14 years old patient admitted to the emergency room for loss of consciousness, recurrent tonic-clonic seizures and post critical confusion for 4 hours prior to admission. The hetero anamnesis collected from his family reveals that the patient has been known to be epileptic since the age of 9 years, on sodium valproate regularly followed with the frequency of one seizure in 16 months. The parents report that the patient had 9 seizures without a return of consciousness within 4 hours before being admitted to the emergency room. This unprecedented state of seizure is believed to be preceded by a thirteen (13) day old flu-like syndrome, which was treated unsuccessfully with: acetaminophen and ascorbic acid before admission. There has been no known exposure to COVID- 19 and has no known vice or allergy.\nIn addition, the clinical examination found a temperature (T°) of 38.6°C; tachycardia at 117 beats/minute, oxygen saturation of 86%; blood pressure of 90/50mm Hg. The neurological examination was not further investigated due to the clinical condition of the patient. He was transferred to the intensive care unit, put on oxygen and antipyretic medication and vascular filling with crystalloids (30ml/kg), while waiting for the result of the metabolic workup, which proved normal. The biological investigation revealed some disorders including: a non-specific inflammatory syndrome with a sedimentation rate (SV) at 62mm/h; a C-reactive protein (CRP) at 36mg/l and white blood cells > 12000/ mm³. While in hospital, the patient presented with repeated paroxysmal seizures within a short period of time, without a return to normal consciousness between seizures. The diagnosis of status with septic shock was made and the patient strictly followed the protocol for the management of status epilepticus (Clonazepam 1ml + Phenobarbital 60mg/kg by slow infusion + Thiopental 5mg/kg as a bolus). He did a brain CT scan which did not reveal any specifics. The intercritical EEG tracing performed revealed a 4-5Hz theta activity, ample, symmetrical, bilateral, and associated with epileptogenic graphoelements of diffuse point type accentuated in the right hemisphere, suggesting multifocal epilepsy.\nThe COVID-19 PCR confirmatory test that was performed at admission was later (24h) positive and the D-dimer level was 2340μg/L. The patient was transferred to the national COVID-19 case management center and subjected to chloroquine sulfate 500mg/day. This molecule was later discontinued on the neurologist's recommendation due to the paroxysmal recurrence of seizures. Several other tracings were requested but were not performed due to the non-availability of EEG in the said structure. He later received corticosteroid therapy and the rest of the management was symptomatic. After 1 month without seizures, following 2 RT-PCR tests, the patient was discharged with a prescription issued by the Neurologist. Case N°2: patient aged 11 years, followed at the National Center for the Management of Persons Infected with COVID-19 for influenza-like illness, respiratory distress and confirmed positive under treatment with chloroquine sulfate 500mg/day, Azythromycin 250mg/day. After 1 week of treatment, loss of consciousness with generalized tonic-clonic seizure, lateral biting of the tongue, hyper salivation and loss of urine occurs. There is no personal or family history of epileptic seizures. According to the mother, the delivery took place in better condition. The clinical examination found respiratory difficulty, tachycardia at 123 beats/minute but apyretic. The neurological examination in the inter critical phase found persistent mental confusion for more than 1 hour. The metabolic balance sheet is within the limits of normal, the other biological parameters reveal a non-specific inflammatory syndrome. The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a heart rhythm disorder. Brain CT scan and intercranial EEG were not performed urgently. We recommended discontinuation of chloroquine sulfate and initiation of clonazepam 1ml intravenous (IV) benzodiazepam as needed. Background antiepileptic [levitracetam (keppra 500g/day)] was instituted following the second seizure. After recovery from the COVID-19 infection, and the absence of seizure for 3 weeks following the new treatment recommendations, we performed a brain scan and EEG, which were found to be normal. The patient was discharged and recommended for neurological surveillance. Case N°3: patient aged 16 years, followed at the national center for the management of COVID-19 positive cases. Patient was asymptomatic on admission. No known drug defects or allergies. Following a voluntary RT-PCR test that the patient performed, he was diagnosed positive for COVID-19 and started treatment with chloroquine sulfate 500mg/day, azythromycin 250 mg/day. After 4 days of treatment, a loss of consciousness with Bravais Jacksonian clonic seizures of the right hemicorps occurred. No personal or family history of epileptic seizures is found.\nThe clinical examination does not reveal any particularities. There was no postcritical confusion and the rest of the neurological examination was normal. The diagnosis of focal epilepsy with roladic paroxysm was made. The metabolic assessment was within normal limits, the other biological parameters revealed a non-specific inflammatory syndrome. We recommended discontinuation of chloroquine sulfate and initiation of clonazepam 1ml IV benzodiazepine as needed. Levitracetam 500g/day was instituted following a repeat attack within 48 hours after discontinuation of chloroquine. The patient was discharged with 16 days of seizure-free follow-up and 2 negative RT-PCR tests. Brain CT scan and EEG performed after recovery showed no detectable abnormalities."
