  "text": "A female teenager had suffered from intractable constipation since infancy. Because the colonoscopy and biopsy results from local hospitals did not confirm the presence of congenital megacolon, the girl had been followed up at a local clinic for a long time. The diagnosis was not confirmed until thyroid masses were found in the Pediatric Department of Shanghai Ruijin Hospital when she was 12â€‰years old. According to our detailed evaluation, she suffered from Hirschsprung disease (HD), growth retardation, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and mucosal neuroma due to a mutation in the RET gene. Thus, the diagnosis of MEN2B was confirmed. Afterward, the girl underwent several surgeries and was still being followed up before the article was published."
