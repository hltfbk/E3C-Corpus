  "text": "A 49-year-old Caucasian man developed acute myopathy after taking oral methylprednisolone for only two days, 24 mg on day 1 and 20 mg on day 2. He discontinued the medication because of new-onset myalgias and lethargy on day 3 and was seen in our clinic four days after beginning therapy. He completely recovered in four weeks by discontinuing the corticosteroids."
