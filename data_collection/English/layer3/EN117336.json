  "text": "A 22-year-old Caucasian man with no complaints or comorbid conditions presented to our hospital with obliteration of the right cardiophrenic sinus by a mass. A non-invasive investigation demonstrated a tumoral mass which was continuous to the pericardium and caused extrinsic compression to the right atrium. The clinical suspicion was a pericardial or bronchogenic cyst. Surgical and anatomopathologic findings led to the diagnosis of a mature cystic teratoma with atrophic thymic tissue at the external teratoma surface."
