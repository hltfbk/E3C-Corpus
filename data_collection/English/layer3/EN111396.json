  "text": "We present a 35-year-old male patient who had been successfully subjected to a modified Latarjet procedure for glenohumeral instability with bony defect treatment, and 7 months later suffered a distal clavicle fracture in his ipsilateral shoulder. With a CT scan, we analyzed the coracoid remnant size (7 mm), and we consider it enough to perform a minimally invasive double-button technique, using this remnant as a distal fixation."
