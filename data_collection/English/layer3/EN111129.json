  "text": "A 51-year-old female patient with a 27-year history of bipolar disorder, being treated with lithium, fluoxetine, olanzapine, gabapentine, perazine and biperiden, was admitted to the hospital due to depressed mood and delusions. A urinary tract infection was diagnosed and antibiotic therapy was initiated. After 5 days of treatment her physical state deteriorated and she developed a fever of 38.4 °C. Her laboratory results revealed a toxic level of lithium (2.34 mmol/l). Acute renal failure was diagnosed and the lithium was withdrawn. After stabilization of her condition, and despite her antipsychotic treatment, further intensification of delusions and depressed mood were observed. All drugs being taken by the patient were withdrawn and lamotrigine and aripiprazole were initiated. Due to the insufficient effectiveness of aripiprazole treatment and because of problems with sleep, quetiapine was added, however further treatment with this drug combination and an increase of quetiapine to 400 mg/d eventually caused NMS. Amantadine, lorazepam and bromocriptine were therefore initiated and the patient's condition improved."
