  "text": "Case one was a 35-year old female with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis who began treatment with combination chemotherapy and Glivec. The patient achieved and maintained a complete hematologic response and continued on Glivec 400 mg/day. In March 2007, she was switched to the copy drug In September 2007, the patient presented in hematologic relapse. At this time, treatment with chemotherapy in combination with Glivec 400 mg/day was resumed. The patient quickly achieved, and maintained, complete hematologic response on Glivec 400 mg/day. The second patient was a 64-year old male with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis who began treatment with truncated chemotherapy in combination with Glivec 400 mg/day. After 6 months, the patient achieved a partial hematologic response and continued on alternating cycles of chemotherapy with continuous administration of Glivec 400 mg/day. The patient received Glivec from January 2006 to February 2007, after which time he was switched to the copy drug. In November 2007, he presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and multiple gastric erosions and died the same day."
