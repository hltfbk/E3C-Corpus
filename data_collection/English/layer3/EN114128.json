  "text": "We report a patient with multiple sclerosis who developed pyrexia, nausea and abdominal discomfort few hours after the third and last infusion of her second alemtuzumab cycle. An infusion related reaction was suspected. The patient had however eaten soft cheese and raw sausage 3 days prior to treatment, and L. monocytogenes septicaemia was diagnosed based on positive blood cultures."
