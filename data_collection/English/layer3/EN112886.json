  "text": "A 59-year-old man was diagnosed with advanced thoracic esophageal cancer and severe funnel chest. Because his sternum was almost attached to the vertebral bone, thereby creating a narrow space in the mediastinum, esophageal surgery was expected to be complicated. After the patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we used the Nuss method to reconstruct the chest and widen the mediastinum. Subsequently, radical thoracoscopic esophagectomy was performed with the patient in the left decubitus position without any difficulty, and the postoperative course was uneventful."
