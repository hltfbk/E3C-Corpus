  "text": "A 80-year-old female sustained right sided neck of femur fracture. She had a history of bone tumor, which was treated with resection and arthrodesis. Subsequently, the patient developed osteomyelitis which healed gradually. The difficulties, in this case, were inability to flex the knee, to determine the trans-epicondylar axis and to use the ankle as a reference. Using lesser trochanter as reference neutral rotation of the limb was determined and K wire was inserted in distal femur of the patient. A post-operative computed tomography (CT) was done to assess the stem version."
