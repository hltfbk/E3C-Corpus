  "text": "A 14-month-old female presented with an enlarging abdominal mass. Computed tomography imaging demonstrated a large mass in the right kidney, duplication of the inferior vena cava below the renal veins and compression of the right inferior vena cava caused by the enormous mass. A right radical nephrectomy was performed. Final pathology was consistent with Wilms tumor. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was executed. Computed tomography imaging at 3 months postoperatively showed the right inferior vena cava played a dominant role and the left inferior vena cava was not detected clearly. During the follow-up of 18 months, no local recurrence or metastasis has been observed."
