  "text": "We report a case of hypercalcemia-induced acute pancreatitis caused by a functioning parathyroid adenoma in a 57-year-old man. The patient initially experienced a series of continuous gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal distension, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, electrolyte disturbance, renal dysfunction, and acute pancreatitis. Due to prolonged hypercalcemia, the patient subsequently underwent surgical resection of the parathyroid adenoma. Two weeks after surgery, his serum calcium, amylase, and lipase concentrations were normal. The patient had a good recovery after a series of other relevant therapies."
