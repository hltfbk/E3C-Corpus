  "text": "A 35-year-old Caucasian female patient presented to our department with an asymptomatic giant intracardiac angioma infiltrating both ventricles. Evaluation of this tumor involved electrocardiography, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, coronary angiography, an open myocardial biopsy, and histological examination of the resected specimen. Because our patient was asymptomatic, she was managed conservatively with regular follow-up. We discuss the treatment options available in comparison with similar cases."
