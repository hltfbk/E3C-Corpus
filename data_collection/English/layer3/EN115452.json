  "text": "A 25 month old child presented to our casualty following a fall from a slide 3 hours prior to presentation. His right lower limb was adducted and internally rotated. There was severe pain on attempting movements. An X-ray of the pelvis was taken which showed a posterior hip dislocation on the right side. The child had an emergency closed reduction under general anaesthesia followed by a broom stick plaster cast with hips in 30Â° abduction. Congruency of reduction was checked with image intensifier before plaster application. The plaster was removed at 6 weeks and gradual weight bearing started. The child was reviewed at 6 and 18 months with MRI scans at 6 and 18 months. There were no signs of avascular necrosis or chondrolysis."
