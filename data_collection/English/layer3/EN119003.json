  "text": "We describe the case of a 20-year-old man who presented with a 7-month history of urinary frequency, nocturia, urgency, suprapubic discomfort during micturition and episodes of severe haematuria shortly after commencing weekly recreational ketamine use. Complementary examinations were negative except for a thickened bladder wall on ultrasound examination and mild inflammatory changes on cystoscopy. So far only nine cases of ketamine-associated ulcerative cystitis have been described."
