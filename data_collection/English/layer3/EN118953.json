  "text": "An unusual case of a rapidly growing giant lipoma-like liposarcoma of the left gluteal and perineal areas in a young male was presented. The patient was managed by wide local excision of the lesion and coverage with split thickness skin graft. The key issues surrounding the treatment of lipoma-like liposarcoma and literature review is discussed."
