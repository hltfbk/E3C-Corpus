  "text": "This report describes a 65-year-old Asian-American woman who developed pure red cell aplasia from high titer neutralizing anti-epoetin antibodies after epoetin-alfa therapy during ribavirin and peg-interferon treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. We describe the outcome of her treatment with rituximab. The reticulocyte count increased, and anti-epoetin antibody titer decreased with a loss of neutralizing activity in vitro, leading to a reduction in blood transfusions, and eventual resolution of anemia, without reactivation of hepatitis C virus."
