  "text": "A 78-year-old male showed severe anemia and a 10% body weight loss over 1â€‰month. Preoperative examination revealed T3N1M0 stage IIIA gastric cancer and T3N0M0 stage IIA rectal cancer. Distal gastrectomy and rectectomy with regional lymph node dissection were performed. Immunohistochemistry revealed two distinct adenocarcinomas with gland duct structures - a colorectal adenocarcinoma and a disseminated gastric adenocarcinoma - that had collided to form an invasive tumor on the serosal surface of the anterior rectum wall."
