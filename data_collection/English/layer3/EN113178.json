  "text": "Two patients, 11 and 9 years old, born from consanguineous parents, were referred to the department of medical genetics at the National Institute of Health in Rabat. The diagnosis of MCPH was made, based on reduced head circumference without brain architecture abnormalities. The two patients were subject to the whole-exome sequencing, which allowed to diagnose a novel homozygous mutation c.1027C > T; p.Gln343* in exon 8 of WDR62, a gene already known to be related to MCPH. Sanger sequencing confirmed the segregation of the mutation in the family."
