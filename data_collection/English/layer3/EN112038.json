  "text": "A 79-year-old Japanese female presented with an approx. 5-cm hepatic mass lesion. We surgically resected the lesion under the clinical diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The histological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with high-grade MEC, consisting of squamoid, mucin-producing, and intermediate tumor cells. Our RT-PCR analysis revealed the presence of CRTC1-MAML2 fusion. This fusion gene was further confirmed by direct sequencing. The patient is still alive almost 10â€‰years after the surgery."
