  "text": "We report the case of Mrs. D. F., 32 years old, living in rural areas, with a history of tuberculosis exposition (tuberculosis infection in stepfather), gravida 2 para 2, admitted to the obstetric emergency department for delivery of a full-term monitored pregnancy. The patient also reported weakness in her lower limbs gradually evolving for 2 months, confining her in wheelchair after 1 month of evolution. These symptoms had been neglected by the attending physician, who recommended the patient to consult for these symptoms after childbirth.\nThe clinical examination on admission found a conscious patient, with stable haemodynamic and respiratory status, with T12 cord compression syndrome and a low back pain, without signs of radiculalgia. The gynaecological examination confirmed the labor progress.\nGiven the neurological condition of the patient, being already in labor, and considering the unknown status of her spinal cord, a caesarean section was made under general anaesthesia without incident, allowing the extraction of a healthy newborn. The patient underwent a day after delivery a lumbar MRI which showed an well defined ovoid epidural mass extending from T9 to T10 with a lobulated contour realising a «wafting silk» sign, compressing and flattening the dorsal spine without infiltrating it, and widening the left foraminal region and eroding the body of the vertebrae with a dumbbell-shaped morphology in transverse images, compressing the nerve root. The mass showed isointense signal in T1-weighted images and hyperintense signal in T2-weighted images, with intense contrast enhancement. The patient underwent surgery the next day. She was positioned in ventral decubitus. The neurosurgical exploration revealed a reddish vascular mass, bleeding on contact, measuring 30×24×13 mm, which was completely removed piece by piece after laminectomy, with good haemostasis achieved with Surgicel cellulose hemostats and bipolar coagulation. Histopathological examination of the mass confirmed its vascular origin, with many small cavernous vessels and thick hyalinised walls, without malignant cells. The post-operative outcome was uneventful. She started motor rehabilitation 3 days after the surgery. The patient was able to walk after 2 weeks. She achieved complete recovery after 1 month of follow-up."
