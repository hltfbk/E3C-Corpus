  "text": "Observation 1 : this was a 44-year-old woman, followed by iron deficiency anemia under iron supplementation, who developed an isolated swelling of the right parotid region, evolving for 5 months. Clinical examination: The patient was in good general condition, apyretic. The tumefaction was pretragal and measured 3cm of long axis, firm, well limited, mobile and painless, associated with multiple, hard and fixed homolateral jugulodigastric adenopathies. The controlateral parotid was with no particularities. There was no chewing discomfort, no trismus or endobuccal pus exit, no peripheral facial paralysis, and the upper aerodigestive tract was free. At Parotid MRI, the lesions straddled between the superficial and deep lobe of the right parotid, oval 20/15mm. It shows a nodule with low intensity T1 signal, and increased T2 signal, enhanced after Gadolinium administration, with presence of multiple homolateral, right jugulodigastric adenopathies. Its characteristics were suspicious of malignancy. The rest of the biological evaluation was normal. Chest x-rays showed no evidence of a possible chest location.The diagnosis of parotid cancer has been strongly suspected. To obtain histological evidence, we decided to perform a partial exofacial parotidectomy with dissection and preservation of the facial nerve. Anatomopathological examination of the resected mass concluded a primary parotid and cervical lymph node tuberculosis. This was confirmed by definitive histological examination. The patient was put on anti-bacillary treatment (2RHZ/4RH) for six months, with significant improvement 6 months after the end of treatment. Observation 2 : a 45-year-old woman, with no notable pathological history, consulted in our facility for a left sub-angulo-mandibular mass evolving for approximately 4 months. There were slight inflammatory signs nearby, particularly a slight redness with pain and fever at 38Â°C without weight loss, chewing discomfort, trismus, or pus exit at salivary orifices. The young woman was in good general condition and had a swelling of the left parotid area, firm, painless, measuring about 4 cm in long axis, and fixed. There was no limitation of the mouth opening or peripheral facial paralysis. Examination of the oral cavity and the opening of the stenon canal did not reveal any inflammation or pus output. Examination of the cervical lymph node areas was normal. The rest of the ENT and general examination was without any particularity. A cervical ultrasound was done to show a tumor lesion, measuring 29 x 28 x 14 mm, of mixed echostructure with central liquid predominance at the lower pole of the left parotid. Parotid MRI showed a lesional process in the deep compartment of the left parotid gland, with low intensity T1 signal, and in the other hand, high intensity signal in diffusion sequence with peripheral enhancement, measuring 30 x 29 x 15 mm. The right parotid and submandibular glands, in addition to the thyroid are without signal or morphological abnormalities. This was in favor of a left parotid abscess. The rest of the biological test, as well as the chest x-ray, were normal. The patient was operated benefiting conservative parotidectomy of the facial nerve. Histopathological study of the cyst wall found epithelial-gigantocellular granuloma with caseous necrosis. The culture of the puncture fluid on Lowenstein-Jensen medium revealed an acid-resistant bacillus, which allowed us to confirm the diagnosis of primary tuberculosis of the parotid gland. The young woman received a medical treatment of antituberculosis drugs combining an initial phase of 2 months based on rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, followed by a consolidation phase of 4 months combining Rifampicin and Isoniazid. The evolution was favourable within 9 months after the end of the treatment."
