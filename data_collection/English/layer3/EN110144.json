  "text": "A 53 year old female presented in the emergency department as a case of alleged assault. The victim was accompanied by her husband. She stated that while her husband was away for work, she had an altercation with her neighbor (a lady) regarding boundary dispute of their adjoining houses. The events took an ugly turn and they got violent. During fighting, her neighbor pulled her hair and inflicted bite marks on left forearm of the victim.\nA careful examination of the injuries revealed the presence of numerous small \"abrasions and bruises\" on the dorsal aspects of left forearm in the lower two third part in an area of 12 cms x 6 cms. The size of injuries varied from 0.5 cms x 0.4 cms to 0.6 cms x 0.5 cms. Though these injuries were quite numerous and overlapping at places, an arched pattern resembling human dental curvature could be made out. These injuries had clearly defined margins. The surrounding skin showed reddening. No itching was present. No other injuries except complaint of pain in scalp area consistent with pulling of hair were reported. Swabs were collected from the site of injury, sealed and sent for examination for detection of saliva and possible DNA matching or detection of any irritant chemical substance. The chemical analysis report confirmed the presence of human DNA but it did not match with the sample obtained from the neighbor. A suspicion of foul play arose. Sample was then matched with the DNA of patient and a positive match was found. With the availability of chemical examination report the police thoroughly interrogated the \"patient\" and she admitted that the fight never took place and she and her husband had planned to get neighbors behind bars because of their unsolved boundary dispute. Though her husband participated in the planning of this conspiracy, it was only her who actually produced these injuries on herself. The couple was then booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal code."
