  "text": "We report a case of a 63-year-old male with a history of anorexia for 3 weeks, fever for 4 days and examination findings of tender hepatomegaly with a liver span of 15 cm in the mid clavicular line and a firm irregular mass in the right iliac fossa. Ultrasound scan of the abdomen showed two large liver abscesses with one of them leaking into the peritoneal cavity causing a localized pus collection, which had been walled off in the right iliac fossa. He was treated with metronidazole and liver abscesses were drained percutaneously under ultrasound scan guidance. The diagnosis of Entamoeba histolytica infection was confirmed with the serology and subsequently by PCR from the aspirated material. He made an uneventful recovery with resolution of the symptoms and right iliac fossa mass."
