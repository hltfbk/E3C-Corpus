  "text": "The patient was a 54-year-old man, who presented with a 10-year history of mechanical back pain, which had become progressively serious and radiated into the left lower limb with numbness 3 mo prior. He had decreased muscle strength (class IV) of the left dorsal extensor and plantar flexor. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed L3-S1 disc degeneration and L4-L5 disc herniation. Because the patient did not respond to various conservative treatments, he underwent a posterior L4-5 discectomy with fixation of the BioFlex dynamic stabilization system (Bio-Spine, Seoul, Korea). Preoperative symptoms were relieved and lumbar function was markedly improved after the operation. L4-L5 disc rehydration of instrumented segment was noted on magnetic resonance imaging at the 2-year follow-up."
