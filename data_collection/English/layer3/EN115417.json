  "text": "Patients included were enrolled in an ongoing large prospective study evaluating children and adults with new onset epilepsy in Lebanon conducted at the American University of Beirut Medical Center in association with the Lebanese Chapter of the International League against Epilepsy. Based on an extensive evaluation, these patients were stratified into idiopathic partial, idiopathic generalized, symptomatic partial or symptomatic generalized epilepsies. Whenever possible the electroclinical syndrome was identified according to the ILAE classification of epilepsy syndromes. Patients were subsequently followed up on regular intervals and were assessed for adverse events, and seizure recurrence. MAE was diagnosed in five (1.6%) out of 307 consecutive children enrolled in this study. LEV was used as adjunctive therapy in four of those children with two experiencing a substantial and dose related worsening in the frequency of their myoclonic and atonic seizures."
