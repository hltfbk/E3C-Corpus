  "text": "We present a unique case of a 57-year-old male patient with an incidentally discovered 2â€‰cm left renal mass. Histopathology examination and immunohistochemical studies confirm the diagnosis of glomangioma (a form of glomus tumor). The patient was followed for one year after partial nephrectomy and showed a benign course without any evidence of local recurrence or metastasis."
