  "text": "Demographic details: The tumor was diagnosed in a 64 male Caucasian patient. Besides atrial fibrillation, arterial hypertension and a hypothyroidism there is no relevant medical history especially no history of cancer. Clinical details: During a routine check-up an unclassified tumor of the pancreatic tail was diagnosed. The lab showed no pathologies. Tumor markers were negative for carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and 72-4 (CA 19-9, CA 72-4) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) were both elevated (AFP 97kU/l, (< 5,8kU/l) and NSE 30,0 μg/l (16,4 μg/l)). A computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy was performed which revealed a low-grade liposarcoma (G1). A CT scan showed no metastases. A surgical resection was recommended by the interdisciplinary tumor board."
