  "text": "Here we report two patients belonging to a consanguineous Moroccan family who present with movement disorder pathology. They were suspected to have choreoacanthocytosis according to biological, clinical and radiological finding. Thus, whole-exome sequencing was performed for precise diagnosis and identified a homozygous novel nonsense mutation c.337C > T (p.Gln113*) in exon 5 of VPS13A in the two affected siblings."
