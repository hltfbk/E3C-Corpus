  "text": "We report an 84-year-old woman with symptoms of chronic mesenteric ischaemia, including post-prandial abdominal pain and weight loss. Investigations demonstrated calcific stenoses at the origins of the celiac, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries, along with nonocclusive calcification in the mid-splenic artery. Coeliac artery angioplasty and stenting was performed, resulting in excellent arterial dilatation at the stenotic point and distal filling of the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries and their branches. Within hours of successful stenting of the coeliac artery, the patient developed severe left upper quadrant pain. Progress imaging demonstrated splenic infarction, likely as a result of calcific emboli dislodged from the calcified plaque at the origin of the celiac artery at the time of angioplasty and stenting. The left upper quadrant pain resolved after 8 days and the patient remains asymptomatic 2 years post-procedure."
