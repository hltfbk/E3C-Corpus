  "text": "A baby girl was born spontaneously at Wangaya General Hospital with APGAR minutes 1, 5, and 10 scores respectively 3, 5, and 8. Infant birth weight was 2.600 grams, body length was 47 cm, and head circumference was 31 cm with estimated age 32-34 weeks. Clinically showing an asymmetrical face, mouth toward the right side without hypoplasia, the eyelids appear asymmetrical with the right eyelid not open when the left eyelid is open, and the two ears not fully formed and diagnosed as Goldenhar Syndrome. From the physical examination, the ear canal is not formed, intact palate, normal eyeball no abnormalities in the spine and found murmur during the systolic-diastolic phase of the heart. Evaluation of the function of vision and hearing has not been concluded. Abdominal ultrasound showed first-degree picture of bilateral hydronephrosis, and from echocardiography, a PDA was found. TORCH profiles in infant were positive for IgG anti-CMV, IgG anti-rubella, and IgG anti-HSV 1. The prognosis, in this case, is good and periodic evaluation needs to be done in 6 months."
