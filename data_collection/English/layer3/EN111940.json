  "text": "A 61-year-old male presented to Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Beijing) with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and several other underlying diseases. He also had persistent coma accompanied by intermittent convulsions, halitosis, and intermittent fever. Blood cultures taken when the patient had a high fever were positive, with the anaerobic bottle yielding an organism identified as S.moorei by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, whilst the aerobic bottle grew Streptococcus mitis. After replacement of venous pipeline, and empirical use of vancomycin and meropenem, the patient's body temperature and white blood cell count returned to normal. Unfortunately, the patient died of severe TTP."
