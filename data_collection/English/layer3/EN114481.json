  "text": "We report two cases of sudden occurence of hypotension and bradycardia during greenlight laser TURP. Two patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy were scheduled for greenlight laser TURP under spinal anesthesia. Hypotension and bradycardia were suddenly occurred during the operation. The blood gas analysis revealed no hyponatremia (indicating TURP syndrome) or anemia (indicating hemorrhage). Operation was suspended and inotropic agents were administrated intravenous immediately, then blood pressure and heart rate increased to normal level within some minutes. The patients were discharged from hospital without any complications. We considered parasympathetic reflex was occurred during greenlight laser TURP."
