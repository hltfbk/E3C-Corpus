  "text": "In a now 15-year-old girl (born at 41 + 6 weeks of gestation) adrenal failure was diagnosed in the neonatal period based on the clinical picture with spontaneous hypoglycaemia, hyponatremia and an extremely elevated concentration of ACTH (3381 pmol/l; ref. level 1,1-10,1 pmol/l), elevated renin (836 ng/l; ref. level 5-308 ng/l), and a decreased concentration of aldosterone (410 pmol/l; ref. level 886-3540 pmol/l). In addition to hyperpigmented skin the patient exhibited sectorial heterochromia iridis. Sequence analysis of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) gene showed a novel homozygous mutation (c.652G > A (p.Ala218Thr), which was predicted in-silico to be possibly damaging. Under daily steroid substitution her electrolyte levels are balanced while she became obese. Puberty occurred spontaneously."
