  "text": "GEKA in an 80-year-old woman was successfully treated with acitretin (0.5 mg/kg/day) combined with surgical removal of the largest lesions. Treatment was well tolerated and led to decreased pruritus and tumor regression within 6 months. The presence of HPV39 was detected in a lesion by polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. No genetic alteration was found, in particular in the genes usually altered in squamous cell carcinoma (including NOTCH1, NOTCH2, CDKN2A, TP53)."
