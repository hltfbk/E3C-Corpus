  "text": "A 29-year-old African American, right-hand-dominant male laborer presented to the outpatient orthopedic hand clinic with a 2--week-old growing mass on the tip of the right small finger. A clinical diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma was made. Silver nitrate therapy was ineffective, though surgical excision resulted in complete resolution of the mass. Surprisingly, the histopathological diagnosis was instead consistent with capillary hemangioma."
