  "text": "A 13-year-old female patient of African descent with clinical symptoms of classic cystic fibrosis and a positive sweat test (97 mEq/L, diagnosed at age 3 years) presented with pancreatic insufficiency and severe pulmonary symptoms (initial lung colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at age 4 years; forced vital capacity: 69%; forced expiratory volume: 51%; 2011). Furthermore, she developed severe acute lung disease and recurrent episodes of dehydration requiring hospitalization. The girl carried the CFTR mutation S4X in apparent homozygosity. However, further analysis revealed a large deletion in the second allele that included the region of the mutation. The deletion that we describe includes nucleotides 120-142, which correspond to a loss of 23 nucleotides that abolishes the normal translation initiation codon."
