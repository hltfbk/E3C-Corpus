  "text": "Our patient was a 46-year-old man of Macedonian ethnicity who presented with a pruritic perianal lesion measuring up to 6cm without pain or bleeding. Two biopsies and a perianal wide surgical excision were performed. The tissue specimens were formalin-fixed and the paraffin-embedded samples analyzed according to standard histochemical and immunohistochemical procedures.Surgical perianal skin excision revealed diffuse eczematoid, whitish plaques. Pathohistology showed Paget cells infiltrating his epidermis and adnexal epithelium, with ulceration. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive Paget cell expression for cytokeratin 7, epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, androgen receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and negative expression for cytokeratin 20 and melan-A."
