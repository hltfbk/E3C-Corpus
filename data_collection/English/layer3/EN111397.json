  "text": "A 72-year-old man was addressed for acute kidney injury with proteinuria. He was under treatment with intravitreal injections of bevacizumab for glaucoma. Kidney biopsy was performed and electron microscopy showed signs of early stages of glomerular microangiopathy. Bevacizumab was discontinued resulting in the improvement of renal function and albuminuria."
