  "text": "An 82-year-old Japanese woman with relapsed lung adenocarcinoma was treated with nivolumab as second-line systemic therapy at our institute. Her laboratory data indicated thrombocytopenia suspected to be an immune-related adverse event following two courses of nivolumab. Subsequently, she developed a massive pulmonary hemorrhage and left cerebral infarction despite intensive treatment including systemic steroid therapy. Although there have been a few reports of thrombocytopenia caused by nivolumab, this is the first report of grade V thrombocytopenia following administration of nivolumab for relapsed non-small cell lung cancer."
