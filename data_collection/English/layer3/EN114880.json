  "text": "Here we report a case of an adult-onset LCC of a Caucasian woman who became symptomatic at age 70 as confirmed by typical neuroimaging and neuropathological findings. After resection of left mesioparietal space-occupying cystic brain tissue the patient has so far remained clinically stable during one year of follow-up with a continuous treatment with glucocorticosteroids."
