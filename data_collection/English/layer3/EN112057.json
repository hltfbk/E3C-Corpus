  "text": "A 60-year-old woman presented with blurred vision in her left eye was diagnosed as CNV secondary to degenerative myopia. Intravitreal injection of conbercept, an anti -vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent, was uneventfully performed in the left eye. Unfortunately, a full thickness MH and retinal detachment was found three weeks postoperatively by ophthalmoscopy and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling and silicone oil tamponade were then performed, and macular retina was reattached soon after surgery. However, MH still kept open during three months' follow-up."
