  "text": "A 35-year-old Hispanic man presented to our emergency department with complaints of generalized malaise, fever, and an evanescent skin rash. During admission, he reported the use of diclofenac potassium for back pain on a daily basis for 1â€‰week. He was noted to have peripheral eosinophilia, so he was admitted for suspected drug reaction involving eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. His initial laboratory work-up showed microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. He also experienced a seizure, encephalopathy, and had a PLASMIC score of 7, thus raising concerns for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. He underwent emergent plasmapheresis, which improved his clinical condition. The diagnosis was confirmed by assessing the levels of disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13, which was less than 3%. In addition, his skin biopsy was positive for patchy complement deposition, demonstrating complement dysregulation."
