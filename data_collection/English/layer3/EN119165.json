  "text": "We report an account of a hyperthyroid patient with a discrepancy between the GFR estimates from cystatin C and creatinine. The cystatin C concentration (1.36 mg/L) was higher and gave an estimated GFR which was lower (51 mL/min/1.73 m2), while the creatinine concentration was lower (36 mumol/L) and gave a corresponding creatinine-estimated GFR that was higher (145 mL/min/1.73 m2) than the iohexol-estimated GFR (121 mL/min/1.73 m2) during the hyperthyroid period. After thyroidectomy, the creatinine concentration was 36 mumol/L and creatinine-estimated GFR was calculated as 73 mL/min/1.73 m2, while the cystatin C concentration and cystatin C-calculated GFR was 0.78 mg/L and 114 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively."
