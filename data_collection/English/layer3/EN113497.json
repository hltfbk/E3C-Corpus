  "text": "We report a rare case of subungual exostosis of the great toe associated with repeated trauma of the nail bed. The lack of radiographic and histopathological examination could lead to misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment. Although completely benign, subungual exostosis should be considered in differential diagnosis of nail bed tumors in young adults, in order to avoid associated complications and unneeded aggressive surgical interventions."
