  "text": "We report on a very rare case of multiple splenic hamartomas in a 46-year-old white woman who had previously undergone surgery for restorative proctocolectomy for familial adenomatous polyposis. A computed tomography scan of her spleen revealed multiple small lesions which measured less than 1cm in diameter. A splenectomy was performed and a histologic examination of the splenectomy specimen revealed the presence of multiple hamartomas."
