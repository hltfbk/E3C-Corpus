  "text": "A 30-year-old male presented with popliteal artery transection injury associated with minimally displaced tibial plateau fracture. He presented to emergency department, 6 h after fall from ground into a 1-m height hole. Physical examination suggested acute ischemia, with signs of paleness, coldness, anesthesia, hemorrhagic bullae below the right knee level. There was severe swelling and ecchymosis in popliteal fossa and around the leg with significant calf tenderness and pedal edema. Tibialis posterior, dorsalis pedis, and popliteal arterial pulses were not palpable. Radiograph suggested minimally displaced tibial plateau fracture with no evidence of knee dislocation. The patient was taken up for emergency surgery after consultation with vascular surgeon. During the closed reduction external fixation and compartment decompression, popliteal artery trunk was found transected and end-to-end repair was performed. During the post-operational period, no complication was developed and the patient was followed-up for 1 year. At the one-year follow-up, he acquired good stability of his right knee with full range of motion."
