  "text": "We reported the case of a 23-year-old male patient with an occipitocervical lesion presenting atypically as neck pain and stiffness over a period of five months. Although hemolymphangioma has historically demonstrated a female predilection (2.25 : 1 female to male) and presentation in the third to fourth decades of life, this case is an atypical manifestation occurring in a young male patient. The clinical characteristics and management choices of this uncommon case of hemolymphangioma in the occipitocervical region are discussed, and a review based on the available literature is also presented."
