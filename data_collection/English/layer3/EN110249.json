  "text": "A 61 years old woman with no particular medical history consulted for urethral mass causing dysuria and intermittent urethral bleeding since 2 months. Physical examination revealed a vascularized tumor which depended on the lower commissure of the urethral meatus of approximately 3 x 2 cm. The biological assessment was correct: no anémia or electrolyte disorder or blood dyscrasias disorder. Ultrasound sonography abdomen-pelvis showed no significant pathology. The urethrocystoscopy showed that the tumor was prolonged until the first third of the urethra and easily bleeding. Finally, cystoscopy was able to cross the tumor and to explore the posterior urethra, bladder neck, and bladder wich appeared normal. The patient has undergone surgical resection of the tumor and a bladder drainage was set up for a period of 3 days. Histopathological study reported a urethral hemangioma with large venous vessels dilated between a lax stroma without atypia cytonucléaire. The vessels are filled with red blood cells. They are sometimes pre thrombosis evidenced by the existence of fibrin deposits. Between vessels, are some beams regular smooth muscle cells.The postoperative course was simple and to this day there has been no recurrence."
