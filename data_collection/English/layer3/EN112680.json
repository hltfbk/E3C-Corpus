  "text": "A 68-year old gentleman with a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) underwent surgery and radiopharmaceutical therapy. Restaging studies nine months later suggested wall thickening localizing to the distal stomach. Endoscopy results showed a large, infiltrative, subepithelial, and ulcerated gastric mass and biopsies revealed anaplastic thyroid carcinoma Conclusion. Incidental thickening or other findings in the stomach in a patient with ATC without gastrointestinal symptoms should be further investigated with endoscopy and biopsies to rule out gastric metastases from anaplastic thyroid carcinoma."
