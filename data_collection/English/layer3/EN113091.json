  "text": "We present a 44-year-old patient with untreated schizophrenia for approximately 25 years, associated with advanced acral localised melanoma. Schizophrenia is generally associated with a higher level of dopamine, which is also a key precursor to melanin synthesis. After a careful analysis of all literature on melanoma in patients with 1) treated and untreated schizophrenia, 2) those with untreated and untreated forms of Parkinson's disease, it would be logical to conclude that the high level of dopamine in the described patient groups is a risk factor for the development of melanoma."
