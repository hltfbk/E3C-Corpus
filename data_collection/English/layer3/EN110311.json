  "text": "A 58-year-old women presented with symptomatic cervical neck and left arm pain. MRI of the cervical spine demonstrating prominent left sided C5-C6 disc herniation causing spinal cord and nerve root compression. She underwent by an antero-lateral left side cervical approach a C5-C6 dissectomy with interbody iliac bone graft and anterior cervical plate fixation. On the morning of the second postoperative day, she started to complain of dysphonia and dysphagia and presented a cervical swelling at the surgical incision site. Over the next 48 hours period, her clinical conditions worsened: she was found pyretic and moderately dyspnoic, the dysphagia turned into odynophagia, whereas the localized swelling diffused in the form of a mantle like subcutaneous emphysema of the neck. Gastrograffin swallow x-ray demonstrated signs of a pharyngo-esophageal rent as leakage of the contrast mean into the upper mediastinum. A consecutive attempted conservative approach, by administering wide-spectrum antibiotics, enteral feeding by nasogastric tube and a cervical subcutaneous drain led to only partial clinical amelioration, reduced the cervical swelling, but still the suction tube at the cervical surgical site draining corpuscolated material. Esophagoscopic finding shows the anterior cervical plate outside a thinner esophageal wall. As the fistula still persisted even after 45 days of conservative treatment and disapearance of inflamation, the patient was taken to the operating room. By a left lateral cervical approach, the fistula tract ahead of the neurovascular pedicle was followed deeply to the left lateral pharyngo-esophageal rent. The latter was found corresponding to the previously placed cervical column-blocking device. Once the remaining esophageal mucosa was isolated from the device, we decide to remove the cervical plate. The rent was primarily sutured with a reinforced 2-layer (mucosal and muscular) row of separated absorbable stitches. A superiorly based SCM muscular flap was then elevated, medially rotated and interposed between the esophagus and the cervical column to protect the viscus repair. The patient was kept on enteral feeding by the naso-gastric tube. Once the contrast swallow control fell to demonstrate any sign of esophageal rent, the patient started to take liquids by mouth and was discharged on the 11 th postoperative day. After one month a flexible endoscopic control confirmed the absence of esophageal perforation, while the patient is taking a normal oral diet."
