  "text": "Here, we present the case of a 58-year-old Thai woman with severe hyperparathyroidism who received a living-related kidney transplant from her 35-year-old son. Our patient developed allograft dysfunction on day 2 post-transplantation despite good functioning graft on day 1. Allograft biopsy showed extensive calcium phosphate deposition in distal tubules. She was treated with cinacalcet (a calcimimetic agent) and aluminum hydroxide. Allograft function was restored to normal within 1Â week after transplantation with greatly reduced intact parathyroid hormone level."
