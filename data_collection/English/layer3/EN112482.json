  "text": "Intraoral scans and additional facial scans were performed with two various scanning systems for the rehabilitation of an edentulous male patient. The obtained raw data was aligned and used for the computer aided design (CAD) of the CD. The virtually constructed dentures were materialized in two various ways, considering rapid manufacturing and digital relining approaches in order to apply functionally molded borders."
