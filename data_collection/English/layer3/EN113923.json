  "text": "The patient presented with sudden onset of seizures and fever on admission. On physical examination he was febrile, comatose and with a stiff neck. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) collected on admission did not reveal any organism on microscopy or culture but showed elevated white cell count. A working diagnosis of severe septicemia with acute meningoencephalitis was then made and the patient was started on IV Cephtriaxone (2 g) twice daily. Despite receiving treatment, his condition deteriorated. A second CSF sample collected on day 3 was also negative for bacteria and other organisms. However, a repeat CSF sample collected on day 8 revealed numerous motile organisms that were identified as Naegleria on microscopy and confirmed to be N. fowleri on polymerase chain reaction. The patient died on day 8 of hospital admission after having received one dose of Amphotericin B (50 mg). Features consistent with PAM were detected on autopsy."
