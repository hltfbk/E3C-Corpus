  "text": "The patient was a 49-year-old female who was missing the majority of her teeth and had gingival atrophy and severe alveolar bone atrophy. After being diagnosed with severe periodontitis, the patient underwent staged load applied implant restoration therapy. The first load-bearing stage was carried out immediately by inserting temporary Osstem mini implants. Maxillary teeth were extracted by using the guided bone regeneration technique, and lateral maxillary sinus lifting was conducted on both sides. During the second load-bearing stage, temporary implants were removed, and permanent implants were placed. The resin bridge was segmented during the third load-bearing stage. During the fourth load-bearing stage, the permanent prosthesis was positioned in the patient's mouth."
