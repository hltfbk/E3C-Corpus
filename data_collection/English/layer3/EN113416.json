  "text": "We report the case of a 55 years - old male suffering from severe right posterior heel pain for 4 months. For his chronic insertional Achilles tendinopathy on the right heel, he received conservative treatment in the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. For outcome assessment, Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain, the range of motion in the ankle, and Roles-Maudsley Score (RMS) for assessment of function were used. At the baseline the pain was severe, and he received physical therapy treatment. After unsuccessful conservative treatment, he underwent RESWT treatment. Numeric Rating Scale was significantly decreased at immediate, short-term and long-term follow-up. After the last treatment, the patient had no pain, and function assessed by Roles-Maudsley Score was excellent. At the follow-up check-up at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months the patient had no pain and excellent functional results."
