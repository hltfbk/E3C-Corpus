  "text": "A 68-year-old woman presented with acute confusion, which progressed into a deep coma (Glasgow-Coma-Scale score 3) within a few hours. The only remarkable finding was a plasma ammonia (NH3) concentration of 697 μmmol/l (range 12-47 μmmol/). Third party history revealed that the patient disliked meat for most of her life (meat = protein, which needs to be metabolized) and had taken nutritional supplements (since supplements often have a high protein-ratio) 2 days before the symptoms started. Protein catabolism results in NH3, which is metabolized via the urea cycle. Consequently, the acute hyperammonemia in our patient was thought to be related to an inherited metabolic disorder, which only unmasked itself as a result of an overload of the corresponding metabolite (in this case protein). Since ornithine carbamyltransferase deficiency (OTC) is the most common inherited urea cycle disorder, this diagnosis became likely and was confirmed later via genetic and metabolic testing (amino acids, orotic acid, etc.). After 2 weeks of treatment (dialysis, low-protein-diet, nitrogen-lowering medication) the patient was discharged in a healthy condition without any neurological deficits."
