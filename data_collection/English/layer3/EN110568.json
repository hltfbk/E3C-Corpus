  "text": "A 51-year old male patient presented to outpatient clinics of our department complaining of abdominal pain and discomfort that was initially presented about two weeks prior to his admission. His history was indicative for surgically treated squamous lung carcinoma 4 years prior to his admission to our hospital. More specifically, he had undergone right pneumonectomy for a stage II squamous cell carcinoma, CK7 (-), p40 (+), CD56 (-), Chromogranin (-), Synaptophysin (-). After lung resection, patient followed platinum-based chemotherapy regimen and remained disease-free for 4 years. During his admission to our hospital, patient underwent computed tomography (CT) scan which revealed a well-defined mass in the tail of the pancreas approximately 5 mm highly suspicious for malignancy, along with lymphathenopathy. Tumor marker CA 19 9 level was 48.5 U/ml (normal range, 0 37 U/ml). EUS-FNA results were inconclusive and positron emission tomography (PET-CT) confirmed a hypermetabolic mass in the tail of the pancreas, compatible with active malignancy and no distant metastatic disease. After multidisciplinary consultation, surgeon's decision was to proceed to resection of the mass and informed consent was obtained from the patient. Laparotomy finally was indicative of the aforementioned pancreatic mass with no sign of intra abdominal spread. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Histopathological examination revealed two adjacent lesions with an immunohistochemical profile similar to that of the resected primary lung tumor. A single peripancreatic lymph node proved to be positive, showing evidence of the disease. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful and was discharged seven days after pancreatic resection. He was referred to oncology department and 18 months after pancreatic resection, patient still remains free of disease and secondary metastatic lesions."
