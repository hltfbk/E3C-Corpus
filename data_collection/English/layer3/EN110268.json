  "text": "A 52 year's old men with no medical history was admitted in the department of nephrology for 2 months of fatigue, dizziness and acute renal failure: creatinine 330 Âµmol/l and clearance of creat 14 ml /min. No abnormalities were observed in physical examination except conjunctival jaundice, liver and spleen were not palpable. Laboratory investigation showed: hemoglobin 86g/L, red blood cell (RBC) 3.67*1012/L, reticulocytes count of 5.2%, white blood cells (WBC) 12.3*109/L, platelet count 36*109/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 451UI/L, indirect bilirubin 49 mmol/L and total bilirubin 96 mmol/L.\nNo hypercalemia was noted. Direct Coomb's test (DCT) was positive for auto-antibody. The autoantibody eluted was warm IgG antibody. At the same time, total serum protein 113 g/L and a spike in gamma globulin estimated to 69 g/l. Serum immune electrophoresis showed that the M protein was the IgG kappa chain. Urinary M protein was 2g/day. Bone marrow aspirates showed infiltration by 78% of plasma cells. Cytogenetics by conventional karyotyping showed no chromosomal abnormalities. A whole body CT-Scan showed osteolytic lesions of vertebral body of C5, D4, L3, L4 and the left iliac wing. After a diagnosis of multiple myeloma and Evan's syndrome was made, chemotherapy was rapidly initiated by BTD (bortezomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone) and continuous corticosteroid therapy. Evolution was marked by deterioration of the hematological and renal state along with the occurrence of hemorrhagic symptoms such as echymosis and haematemesis. The patient died secondary of a lactic acidosis."
