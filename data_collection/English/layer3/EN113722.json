  "text": "We first performed interpositional arthroplasty, in which an interposition of fascia temporalis and surrounding fat tissue was inserted into the defect after bilateral condylectomy, increasing the maximum mouth opening from 5.0 to 32.0 mm. Subsequently, orthodontic treatment and advancement of the mandible were carried out by mandibular DO, using miniscrews and miniplates. Finally, sliding genioplasty was performed to bring the tip of the mandible forward. The total amount of mandibular advancement at the menton was 16.0 mm. An improved facial appearance and good occlusion were eventually achieved, and the apnea-hypopnea index decreased from 37.1 to 8.7. There was no obvious bone resorption or pain in the temporomandibular region, limited mouth opening (maximum mouth opening: 33.0 mm), myofascial pain or headache, downward rotation of the mandible, or lateral shift of mandibular position evident at 5 years and 6 months after mandibular DO."
