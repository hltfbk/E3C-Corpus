  "text": "A 51-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with sudden-onset severe abdominal pain, as well as hypotension and low level of hemoglobin. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 2.5â€‰cm filling defect and discontinuity in the wall of the gallbladder body, and a massive hematocele in the abdominal cavity. Past medical history was significant for hypertension and had been taking daily aspirin for the past three years because of interventional surgery for cerebral aneurysms, but no history of recent abdominal trauma or past episodes of biliary colic. The patient underwent an urgent laparoscopic abdominal exploration and the gallbladder was removed. The pathology just showed chronic cholecystitis and the patient recovered well."
