  "text": "We report a rare case of ocular cysticercosis with multiple disseminated subcutaneous nodules and papilledema in both eyes. A 22-year-old Brahmin man presented with complaints of gradual loss of vision in both eyes and multiple small masses all over his body. On clinical evaluation, multiple subcutaneous nodules were seen on his face, mandibular area, elbow, arm, and abdomen. A fundus evaluation showed bilateral blurred disc margin. The case was managed with steroids and anti-parasitic drugs."
