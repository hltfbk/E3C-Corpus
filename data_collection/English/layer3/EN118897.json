  "text": "A Caucasian male, who was born in 1943, sustained paraplegia at T-4 (ASIA-B) in 1981. This patient underwent implantation of sacral anterior root stimulator in September 1985. The bladder stimulator started giving trouble since 1996 and the patient went back to using indwelling urethral catheter. In August 2006, this patient passed blood in urine after a routine change of indwelling catheter. Cystoscopy showed unhealthy bladder mucosa. Bladder biopsy revealed carcinoma, which was infiltrating bundles of muscularis propria. Many of the nests showed evidence of squamous differentiation, while others could be transitional or squamous. This patient underwent cystectomy with lymphadenectomy in March 2007 in a hospital nearer his home. Histology showed three nodes involved. This patient has been doing well since the operation."
