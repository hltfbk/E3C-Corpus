  "text": "An 82-year-old male was referred following a computed tomography scan showing a 160 mm diameter mass in the left lobe of the liver. This huge mass was diagnosed as HCC, arising in the absence of cirrhosis or viral hepatitis. After tumor removal, the patient's high AFP level persisted for 2 years."
