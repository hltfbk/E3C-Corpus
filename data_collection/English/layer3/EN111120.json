  "text": "We report a case of a 52-year-old man with severe chest pain and recurrent electrical storms with an implanted cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) device. Coronary angiography and computed tomography (CT) revealed the rare anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery (AAORCA) with a high interarterial course between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. As symptoms typically develop on exertion, placing the patient at an increased risk of ischemic distress, a stress myocardial perfusion imaging study helped to identify his high-risk status. Although patient-specific, a surgical repair was the only concrete step agreed upon after multiple collaborative discussions with the cardiac surgeons. Surgery significantly improved the symptoms, with the patient reporting resolution of his chest pain, as well as no documented inappropriate defibrillator activity on follow-up appointments."
