  "text": "Here, we describe a 56-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital due to a 6-mo history of hemafecia, which had been aggravated for 1 mo. Colonoscopy revealed a 3 cm Ã— 4 cm ulcerated mass in the rectum 4 cm from the anus. Preoperative pathological examination showed villous adenoma, moderate-to-high-grade dysplasia, good differentiation, and invasion of the mucosal muscle. The patient had R1 after ultra-low anterior resection, but he refused extended resection and experienced severe liver function impairment after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Ultimately, the patient underwent PDT to remove R1. After five years of follow-up, there was no liver function impairment, recurrence, metastasis, sexual dysfunction, or abnormal defecation function."
