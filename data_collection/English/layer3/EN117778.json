  "text": "We describe a 25-year-old Turkish woman who was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain and a 3-year palpable abdominal mass, which was found present since her second pregnancy. Examination revealed a 15 x 20-cm mass in her abdominal cavity. Computed tomography revealed a mass with regular outlines, measuring 18 x 11 x 12 cm, associated with the left kidney, and causing marked hydroureteronephrosis. We excised the mass and performed a left nephrectomy on our patient. The immunohistopathology of the mass was consistent with renal oncocytoma. No local or distant metastasis was seen at 6 months postoperatively."
