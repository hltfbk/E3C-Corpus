  "text": "A 66-year-old Chinese woman presented to our hospital complaining of intermittent pain of right upper quadrant. An enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed hepatocellular carcinoma. Subsequently, the patient underwent a radical partial hepatectomy. Primary FDCS of the liver was diagnosed pathologically. Except for regular follow-up examinations, the patient did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. However, fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) confirmed lymph node metastases in the space of ligamentum hepatogastricum and pancreatic head, as well as the portacaval space. The patient was given systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine and docetaxel for she was unsuitable for surgery. Satisfactorily, the metastatic lymph nodes were significantly reduced to clinical complete remission after eight cycles of chemotherapy. Then, strengthened radiotherapy was followed when the patient rejected the opportunity of surgery. Eventually, the carcinoma got better control and the patient was free of progression."
