  "text": "We report two cases of osteoid osteoma of cervical spine managed with surgical excision. Case1 had recurrence of tumor at the left C6 pedicle after minimally invasive intervention that was later managed by surgical excision with the help of CT-guided navigation. Case 2 had osteoid osteoma of the right C4 lateral mass that was treated with surgical excision and fusion."
