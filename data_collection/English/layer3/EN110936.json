  "text": "A 31-year-old G3P0020 at 28 weeks and 1 day was admitted with severe thrombocytopenia and was ultimately diagnosed with TTP. With therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), maternal status improved. At 28 weeks 6 days, however, non-reassuring fetal testing prompted cesarean delivery with placental abruption noted intraoperatively. Pathology examination confirmed placental abruption and also revealed multiple placental infarcts."
