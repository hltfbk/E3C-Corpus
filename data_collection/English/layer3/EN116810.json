  "text": "A 34-year-old Malay woman, gravida 3 para 2 at 8 weeks of pregnancy, was admitted for hyperemesis gravidarum, presented with sudden onset of diplopia, blurring of vision and headache. A magnetic resonance scan of her brain showed the presence of cerebral edema with no space occupying lesion, but magnetic resonance venography ultimately revealed right transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus thrombosis. The patient was treated with anticoagulation for 1 year, after which the patient recovered fully."
