  "text": "We present a case where systemic steroid treatment was applied in sustained anastomotic stenosis after endoscopic balloon dilatation. We performed delta-shaped anastomosis in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy to treat early-stage gastric cancer in a patient. The patient experienced abdominal pain post-surgery; subsequent investigation revealed edematous anastomotic stenosis. The stenosis sustained even after endoscopic balloon dilatation and local steroid injection. Consequently, we applied systemic steroid treatment."
