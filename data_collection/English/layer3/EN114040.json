  "text": "A 67-year-old Japanese man presented with adjusted total knee arthroplasty 3Â years after osteochondral autologous transfer. Although in pain, arthroscopic assessment was not severe. The specimens which was gained during total knee arthroplasty were investigated in gross and microscopically using immunohistochemical staining technic. Histological examination revealed that the gap between grafted plugs and host osteochondral tissues was filled with fibrous tissue that stained positive for type I collagen. A degenerative change and some neovascularity were observed in the regenerated tissue and host trabecular bone. Furthermore, cysts and bone marrow edema were observed."
