  "text": "The 73-year-old male patient presented with lateral cervical lymphadenopathy, B symptoms, lactate dehydrogenase and beta2-microglobulin elevation. Computed tomography (CT) showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral lung involvement. Biopsy of both disease locations revealed the presence of DLBCL. Successive bone marrow trephine biopsy proved the presence of concordant DLBCL involvement. At the time of diagnosis, a MG was present as well. The patient did not respond to the standard treatments, and subsequently underwent lenalidomide 25 mg/m(2) days 1-21 q28 plus dexamethasone 40 mg days 1-4, 9-12 e 17-20. This therapeutic regimen was efficacious and safe as salvage therapy in extranodal DBCL with a MG. Furthermore, we observed a close association between DLBCL response to therapy and MG levels, suggesting that the amount of M-protein might be a surrogate marker of disease response."
