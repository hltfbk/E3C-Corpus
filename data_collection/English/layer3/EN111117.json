  "text": "Here, we describe a patient who presented with acute diplopia and gait unsteadiness which was first deigned with Chiari malformation type-1. However due to progression of the ataxia the full neurologic evaluation was considered which established the diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (Machado-Joseph-Disease)."
