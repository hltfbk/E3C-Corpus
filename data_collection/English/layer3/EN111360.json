  "text": "Our patient was a 57-year-old Caucasian woman with a medical history of bipolar I disorder, opioid use disorder, benzodiazepine use disorder, and Crohn's disease who was admitted to our behavioral health unit for suicidal ideation. She had been experiencing multiple panic attacks for 2.5 weeks along with poor sleep, increased energy, excessive spending, and feelings of helplessness. The patient was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, manic episode without psychotic features, and benzodiazepine use disorder. She was started on valproic acid, citalopram, propranolol, and quetiapine. By day 6 of her hospitalization, the patient had altered mental status, varying levels of consciousness, confusion, and ataxic gait. Her ammonia levels were found to be elevated. All of her medications were discontinued, and lactulose was initiated. She returned to her baseline mentation within 48 hours and was discharged with lithium and quetiapine. The treatment team concluded that this patient had valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy, a rare but reversible reaction to valproate."
