  "text": "A 43-year-old female patient reported to the Department of Oral surgery with a chief complaint of painful episodes in the left mandibular area, halitosis and increase in the size of lips and tongue since 8 years. Evaluation of his medical history revealed she had been diagnosed with acromegaly at the age of 40. She gives a history of gradual decrease in eyesight and frequent headaches episodes since past 2 years. She was also diagnosed with hypertension (140/90 mmHg), hyperglycemia and hyperthyroidism. Extra oral clinical examination revealed classic features of acromegaly including facial asymmetry, thickened lips, mild mandibular prognathism, and retrusion of maxilla, proptosis, prominent nose and supraorbital ridges. Skin over the forehead appeared thickened. Fingers and toes appeared large and broad. Intraoral examination revealed, macroglossia, Angle's class-III malocclusion, the first left molar 36 was decayed and poor oral hygiene. The patient was subjected to orthopantomogram radiographic examination which revealed generalized moderate bone loss, root fragment of 36 and hypercemoentosis (16,27,37 and 46). Considering the patient's uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension, dental treatment was deferred and he was referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation."
