  "text": "A 29-year-old military male basic trainee with varus alignment about his knees suffered bilateral medial tibial plateau stress fractures several weeks into military basic training. He underwent radiographic and laboratory evaluation of his stress fractures and eventual operative fixation of his bilateral tibial plateau fractures. Intraoperative specimens obtained from the fracture sites distal to the articular surface demonstrated abnormal fibrous appearing tissue. Histology demonstrated the presence of hyaline cartilage."
