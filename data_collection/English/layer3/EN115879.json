  "text": "A 23-year-old Chinese woman presented with right middle segmental bronchostenosis caused by bronchial tuberculosis. She was informed of the surgical procedure and she provided informed consent. After taking anti-bronchial tuberculosis drugs for 2 months, she underwent our new bronchoscopic balloon dilation treatment (dilating time, 40 minutes; pressure, 14atm). After anti-bronchial tuberculosis treatment for 13 months, her intermediate bronchus was observed with videobronchoscopy again and no re-stenosis was seen. Furthermore, a computed tomography scan revealed that her right lower lobe and right middle lobe had reopened. No complications occurred in the patient."
