  "text": "We describe the case of a 57-year-old woman with a diagnosis of urticarial vasculitis. Due to lack of response to first-line treatment and the severity of the disease, treatment with omalizumab was initiated. Omalizumab 150 mg was administered every four weeks for three months. Second-generation antihistamines were used as needed. Both CU-Q2oL and UAS 7 improved. After three-month therapy with omalizumab, disease severity improved from moderate severity (UAS7 = 19) to well controlled (UAS7 = 6). However, 5 months after the last administration of omalizumab, the patient complained of worsening symptoms and active disease with quality of life impairment. A single dose of omalizumab (150 mg) was prescribed with corticosteroids. Thereafter, the patient presented a disease activity and quality of life with a fluctuating pattern that was controlled with additional doses of omalizumab."
