  "text": "We present the case of a 25-year-old female with a typical clinical presentation for acute pyelonephritis (high fever, left flank pain, left costovertebral angle tenderness, hematuria, elevated inflammatory markers, and a hypoenhancing region in the left kidney on contrast-enhanced computed tomography). However, urine and blood cultures were both negative, the serum creatinine was elevated, and the urinalysis revealed significant proteinuria and dysmorphic red blood cells. A kidney biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of IgA nephropathy. She was treated with a combination of lisinopril and methylprednisolone, with good response."
