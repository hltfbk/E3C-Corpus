  "text": "We report the case of a 42-year-old male patient who underwent an arthroscopy of the left shoulder. The anesthesia, the surgical procedure as well as the post-operative course went uncomplicated. The patients were discharged 6 h after the end of the surgical procedure. 4 h after discharge, however, the patient developed severe respiratory distress and signs of hemodynamic shock due to an ipsilateral (tension) post-operative pneumothorax. The available literature is reviewed focusing on the possible pathogenic mechanisms implying the development of this complication."
