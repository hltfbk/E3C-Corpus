  "text": "A Chinese quartet family with two siblings predominantly affected by cone-rod dystrophy and short stature were recruited. The craniofacial dysmorphism and on-set age-of-cone-rod dystrophy in the proband showed a minor intrafamilial variability. Whole genome sequencing was performed to provide the full spectrum of the two siblings' genetic variations. In this study, we present the patients' clinical features and our interpretation of the whole genome sequencing data. After examining the data, we focus on two compound heterozygous mutations, (c.3902C > A, p.S1301X; c.6436C > T, p.R2146X) in ALMS1, which are shared by two siblings."
