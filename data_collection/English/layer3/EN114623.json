  "text": "A 56 year old Indian male patient underwent a cemented total hip replacement. Three hours post-operatively, the patient's left lower limb was found to be pale and pulseless. Angiography showed complete occlusion of the left common femoral artery. Thrombectomy was carried out immediately and the patient recovered well."
