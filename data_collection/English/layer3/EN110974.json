  "text": "A 72-year-old immunocompetent Han Chinese man had repeated dry cough for more than half a year. CT examination of chest showed an irregular mass at the left hilum of the lung, and two small nodules in the right lung, which were considered as the left central lung cancer with right lung metastasis. However, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis coexisting with central type lung cancer based on the results of laboratory examination, percutaneous lung biopsy, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and surgical pathology. The patient underwent surgical resection of the left central type lung cancer and was placed on fluconazole treatment after a positive diagnosis was made. Five years after the lung cancer surgery, the patient had a recurrence, but the pulmonary cryptococcus nodule disappeared."
