  "text": "In our two female cases, headaches started following spinal anesthesia on the 11th and 14th hours, respectively. No response was obtained from patients diagnosed with postdural puncture headache with classical treatments such as bed rest, hydration, oral analgesic, and caffeine combination as well as intravenous theophylline application. The treatment of oral pregablin, commonly used for cases that rejected epidural blood patch, caused a significant decrease in headache severity. Later, the two cases whose headaches were completely resolved were discharged from the hospital on the post-operative 7th day."
