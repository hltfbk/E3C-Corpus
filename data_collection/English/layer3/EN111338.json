  "text": "A 85-year-old man and a 75-year-old woman developed acute mesenteric ischemia due to cardiac embolism. The first patient received an insufficient dose of anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation and the second patient dicontinued her anticoagulantia to avoid bleeding during a routine colonoscopy. Both patients presented with severe abdominal pain and computed tomography showed thrombus in de superior mesenteric artery. Successfulrevascularization with good clinical outcome was achieved by means of an endovascular first approach."
