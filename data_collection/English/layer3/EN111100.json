  "text": "A 79-year-old man with esophageal cancer was diagnosed with DAA incidentally. The descending aorta was located on the right side of the thoracic vertebrae. Safe dissection of the mediastinal lymph nodes was difficult using the right transthoracic approach because of the anatomical abnormalities. During surgery, we used cervical mediastinoscopy combined with the IONM system to preserve the bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerves. Severe complications, including recurrent nerve palsy, were not observed postoperatively."
