  "text": "A 70-year-old Caucasian man who had undergone low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision and temporary loop ileostomy creation at our institution returned to our department 30 days later because of nausea, vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain and anuria of about 24 hours' duration. During his physical examination, the patient appeared dehydrated and had tachypnea and a reduced level of consciousness. His laboratory tests showed that he had acute kidney injury and severe lactic acidosis."
