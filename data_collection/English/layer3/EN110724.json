  "text": "A 73-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our hospital with fever and fatigue. She had a maximum body temperature of 102.3 Â°F with lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. She was diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection on the basis of a positive result from a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography revealed multifocal, subpleural ground-glass opacities with nodular consolidations bilaterally. Computed tomography also demonstrated atypical bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, a rarely reported imaging feature of COVID-19. Chest computed tomography 1 month before the presentation did not show focal consolidations or lymphadenopathy. This indicated that the findings were due to the patient's severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. She received 5 days of oral hydroxychloroquine and experienced resolution of her symptoms."
