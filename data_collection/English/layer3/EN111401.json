  "text": "Case 1 involved a 58-year-old woman presenting progressive pharyngeal discomfort for the past year. She was diagnosed as KJD using endoscopic and radiographic findings. She underwent diverticulectomy with cricopharyngeal and proximal esophageal myotomy. Staple line leakage developed at 1 month after surgery and was successfully treated conservatively. At 5 months after surgery, she was asymptomatic. Case 2 involved a 77-year-old woman presenting dysphagia for the past 2 years. She had a history of bilateral breast cancer and had hypertension, asthma, and osteoporosis. Taking her age and medical history into account, we selected diverticulopexy with cricopharyngeal and proximal esophageal myotomy. The postoperative course was uneventful. At 2 years after surgery, she remained free of dysphagia."
