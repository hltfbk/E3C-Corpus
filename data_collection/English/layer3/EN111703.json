  "text": "We present a case of an 82-year-old man with sudden onset neurological deficits, including left hemiparesis with crural predominance, vertical nystagmus, right internuclear ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria and dysmetria on the left arm. CT angiography disclosed basilar artery hypoplasia in the proximal two thirds and a persistent trigeminal artery. He was diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke. He was submitted to rt-PA with partial reversion of deficits."
