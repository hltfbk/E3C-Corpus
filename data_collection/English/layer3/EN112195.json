  "text": "We report a case of a 15-year-old female who was diagnosed with CEPS (Abernethy type Ib) accompanied by pulmonary arterial hypertension. This case was incidentally identified during abdominal ultrasound examination and confirmed by mesenteric and splenic arteriography. During more than 4 years of follow-up, after receiving sildenafil (80 mg/day), the patient's condition improved in the first year after discharge. However, one year later, the patient's conditions start to deteriorate."
