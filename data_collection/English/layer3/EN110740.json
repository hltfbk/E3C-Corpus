  "text": "A 38-year-old white Arabian woman, gravida 1, parity 0, abort 1, sought medical advice in our outpatient clinic with a complaint of lower abdominal pain that had started 2 days earlier. The pain had first started as mild cramps, which then suddenly intensified nearly 2â€‰hours before her presentation to our clinic, spread to the groin and femur, more prominent on the right side, and became an ongoing pain. As preoperative diagnoses of the patient, ovarian cyst rupture and ectopic pregnancy were suspected, and fallopian tube torsion was also suspected due to the normal appearance of the ovaries and the appearance of the hydrosalpinx on ultrasonography. The patient underwent laparotomy with a Pfannenstiel incision. Both tubes had hydrosalpinx, and the fimbrial ends were blunt and obliterated. Bilateral salpingectomy was performed because the right tube had a prominent necrotic appearance, and there was a significant hydrosalpinx in both tubes."
