  "text": "A 62-year-old white woman presented with progressive weakness, fatigue, confusion, and delirium secondary to acute kidney injury and acute hepatitis associated with excessive energy drink use. Clinical improvement occurred with supportive care and discontinuation of energy drinks, with resolution of acute kidney injury and progressive improvement of liver function. The defined mechanism of injury is unknown but thought due to energy drink ingredients."
