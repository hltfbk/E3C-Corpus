  "text": "Here, we report a Chinese young child diagnosed as PFIC with variants in tight junction protein 2 (TJP2). The patient was affected by a long history of jaundice, pruritus, and failure to thrive. Highly elevated level of serum total bile acid (TBA) and normal levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) were observed at hospitalization. The patient's clinical symptoms could be alleviated by administration of ursodeoxycholic acid. Genetic testing by next generation sequencing (NGS) found novel compound heterozygote mutations c.2448 + 1G > C/c.2639delC (p.T880Sfs*12) in TJP2, which were inherited from her mother and father, respectively. Both mutations were predicted to abolish TJP2 protein translation, and neither has previously been identified."
