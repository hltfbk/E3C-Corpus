  "text": "We report a case of a displaced odontoid synchondrosis fracture in a 2-year-old girl with anterior subluxation of C1 over C2 vertebra. This was treated with a posterior atlantoaxial fusion using sublaminar wiring. Immediate post-operative radiography showed partial reduction of the displaced odontoid fragment on C2 body with residual step deformity with angulation at the fracture site. Follow-up at 1 year showed excellent remodeling."
