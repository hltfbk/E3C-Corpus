  "text": "A 6-year-10-month-old boy characterized by special facial features, short stature and mental retardation was referred to our pediatric endocrinology department. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was done to detect the molecular basis of his disease. This patient was confirmed to carry two variants in the CSNK2A1 gene and one in the TRPS1 gene. The variant in the CSNK2A1 gene was vertically transmitted from his father, and the variant in TRPS1 gene from his mother. These two variants are classified as pathogenic and the causes of the presentation in this child. This patient's father and mother have subsequently been diagnosed as having OCNDS and TRPSI respectively."
