  "text": "A 13-year-old black African boy of the Bantu ethnic group with unknown tetanus vaccination status presented to our pediatric emergency room for the management of chest and vertebral pains which started a few days after traditional treatment by scarification and herbal and leaf ointment. The treatment was initiated by a traditional healer and indicated for a closed fracture of our patient's left forearm sustained during a fight. The diagnosis of generalized tetanus was made on the basis of generalized contractures with opisthotonus, trismus, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Despite prompt intensive care management, he died a few hours after admission."
