  "text": "A 20-year-old Caucasian woman with acute onset of left-sided weakness and numbness was admitted to hospital with neurologic signs of left-sided hemiparesis and hypoesthesia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass lesion of abnormal signal intensity with concentric enhancing rings in the right parietal lobe, without perifocal edema. The characteristic concentric pattern detected on the magnetic resonance images was highly suggestive of Balo disease, and corticosteroids were administered. Evoked potentials, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and magnetic spectroscopy findings were not specific, and glioma was also included in the differential diagnosis. A stereotactic biopsy was not diagnostic.After one month the patient showed moderate clinical improvement, and during 12 months follow-up, no further relapses occurred. In the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging, the concentric pattern had completely disappeared, and only a low-signal, gliotic lesion remained."
