  "text": "After a minor surgical intervention, a 32-year-old Caucasian woman with no significant medical history went into sudden hemodynamic deterioration due to acute heart failure. An urgent echocardiogram showed severe biventricular dysfunction and an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 20%. Extracorporeal life support and mechanical ventilation were required. Five days later her ventricular function had fully recovered, which allowed the progressive withdrawal of medical treatment. Prior to her hospital discharge, cardiac MRI showed neither edema nor pathological deposits on the delayed contrast enhancement sequences. At her six-month follow-up examination, the patient was asymptomatic and did not require treatment."
