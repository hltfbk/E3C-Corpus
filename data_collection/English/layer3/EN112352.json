  "text": "Our patient was a 20-year-old Japanese woman with a 4-month history of lower back pain. A spinal computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging of her lumbar spine revealed an osteolytic lesion involving the L3 vertebral body, and the tumor extended toward the left side of the paravertebral soft tissue and into the left pedicle. The lesion was diagnosed as a giant cell tumor by needle biopsy. Denosumab treatment calcified the paravertebral giant cell tumor lesion and the tumor vertebral body was removed completely by total en bloc spondylectomy."
