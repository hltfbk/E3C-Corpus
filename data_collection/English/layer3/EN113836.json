  "text": "A 90-year-old female of Hispanic origin presented with a 2-week history of generalized weakness, dizziness, shortness of breath and extensive purpuric formations that involved the left arm towards the lateral aspect of the thorax with the inclusion of a small right lateral neck hematoma formation. Upon initial laboratory screening, a hemoglobin level of 7.9, a hematocrit level of 21.9 and a PTT value of 70.9 were discovered. Despite conventional hemostatic treatment approaches, the patient did not show marked improvement of the laboratory values. Ongoing specialized laboratory reports, combined with the clinical presentation of the patient, led to the diagnosis of Acquired Hemophilia A. Treatment with recombinant porcine Factor VIII was initiated, which led to rapid improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory values. The patient was discharged with current treatment plan and emergent follow/up with a hematologist was scheduled."
