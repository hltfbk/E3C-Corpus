  "text": "The authors report on a very preterm girl with a pre-existing intraventricular haemorrhage and a CVAD-associated thrombus that, after removal of the CVAD, led to assumed pulmonary embolism and to an extended aortic embolism with consequent cerebral stroke. The girl was treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) for about 50Â days. During the further in-hospital stay the girl developed a mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Follow-up revealed clinical signs of cerebral palsy."
