  "text": "A 21-year-old Chinese woman was admitted with a seven-month history of unilateral severe hematuria. On admission, she was identified as having nutcracker syndrome. The patient was treated with retroperitoneal laparoscopic donor nephrectomy and renal autotransplantation. The patient underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic donor nephrectomy using a retroperitoneal three-port technique with ex vitro autograft repair and subsequent renal autotransplantation into the iliac fossa. In order to shorten the hot ischemia time and improve the patient's cosmetic outcome, a minor oblique incision in the left, lower quadrant was prepared in advance of the laparoscopic donor nephrectomy for use as a site for the autograft to be procured through the retroperitoneal space and as a transplant site for the autograft. Two days after the operation, the patient's symptoms subsided. Serum creatinine before and after the operation were 53 mmol/L and 55 mmol/L, respectively. The patient had normal renal function during a follow-up three months after the operation."
