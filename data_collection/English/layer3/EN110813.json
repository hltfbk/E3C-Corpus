  "text": "A 24-years-old male patient presented with chronic non-productive cough of 4 months duration. He had been diagnosed with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and lung malignancy elsewhere and presented to us as the symptoms persisted. We offered him the biopsy under endobronchial ultrasound-guide sheath-transbronchial lung biopsy and sample specimen were sent for next generation sequencing analysis, returned as Blastomyces Dermatitidis infection. The patient was treated by itraconazole for 6 months, his symptoms decreased significantly and the CT scan showed resolution of the lesion."
