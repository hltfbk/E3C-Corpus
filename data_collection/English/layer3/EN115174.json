  "text": "A 63-year-old Asian male was treated with intravitreal ranibizumab injection for chronic macular edema with branch retinal vein occlusion in his right eye. Before treatment, best-corrected visual acuity in his right eye was 20/200. Nine days after injection, a full thickness macular hole developed with reduction of macular edema. After pars plana vitrectomy combined with cataract surgery, the macular hole was successfully closed, and the best-corrected visual acuity in his right eye improved to 20/40."
