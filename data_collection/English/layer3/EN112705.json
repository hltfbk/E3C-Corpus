  "text": "A 78-year-old man with a history of coronary heart disease, class III heart failure, cardiac cachexia, long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Parkinson's disease presented with weakness, dizziness, presyncope, fatigue, and inability to stand. Orthostatic blood pressure (BP) measurements revealed a seated BP of 120/70 mmHg that decreased to 60/40 mmHg upon standing, accompanied by a slight increase in heart rate from 70 to 74 beats per minute. He was diagnosed with nOH and prescribed droxidopa (titrated to 600 mg three times daily). Treatment with droxidopa improved the patient's ability to stand and his orthostatic BP."
