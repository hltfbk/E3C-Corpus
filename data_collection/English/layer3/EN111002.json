  "text": "A 55-year-old man was diagnosed with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis 15 years ago. Before surgery, he underwent regular endoscopic pancreatic stenting for pancreatic ductal stenosis for 3 years. Three months before surgery, his duodenal stenosis worsened, and he was referred to our department for surgery. Preoperative imaging revealed pancreatic and bile duct stenosis, duodenal stenosis, and portal vein stenosis. To avoid intraoperative bleeding caused by the development of collateral veins, we performed a triple drainage procedure: longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy with coring-out of the pancreatic head, hepaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy. The patient did not develop postoperative complications, and he was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 14. For 5 years after surgery, no abdominal pain or recurrent pancreatitis was observed."
