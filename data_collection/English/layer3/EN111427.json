  "text": "We report the case of a 1-year-old girl with a choroid plexus papilloma, who developed postoperative nosocomial meningitis due to MDRAB. The bacterial strain was sensitive only to tigecycline and colistin, and showed varying degrees of resistance to penicillin, amikacin, ceftriaxone, cefixime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem, imipenem, and tobramycin. She was cured with intravenous doxycycline and intraventricular gentamicin treatment."
