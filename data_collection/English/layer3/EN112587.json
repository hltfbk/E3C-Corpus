  "text": "A 30-year-old rider fell from his horse, causing swelling of the wrist and the fifth finger was rotated with minimal active motion. The radiological assessment (X-rays and tomography) showed a pure HMD. Under sedation, we performed reduction of the dislocation. However, the reduction was lost at the slightest movement requiring a K-wirefixation. The patient refused the surgical treatment and requested non-operative treatment. Thus, while the joint was held in a reduced position, a well-molded plaster cast was applied which immobilized both the hamatometacarpal joint and the metacarpophalangeal joint. Later, the patient was reviewed weekly until 6 weeks, then the cast was removed altogether and the digits were mobilized. At the follow-up of 6 months, he had regained full range of motion of the little finger with no pain, no recurrence of dislocation and returned to his previous level of sporting activity."
