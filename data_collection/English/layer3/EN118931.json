  "text": "A 71-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with an episode of hematemesis but was otherwise hemodynamically stable. Emergency gastroscopy revealed a bleeding mass projecting to the duodenum. Fluid, blood and electrolyte resuscitation followed. Computed tomography revealed a small mass in the head of the pancreas. A Whipple operation was performed. Pathology revealed a solid pseudo-papillary tumor. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful and no recurrence was present a year after the operation."
