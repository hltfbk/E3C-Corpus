  "text": "A 52-year-old female was admitted in the department of endocrinology with severe headache, dizziness, and visual problems. She had been treated for hypertension diagnosed eight months ago. She was taking Acebutolol 200 mg /day, amlodipine 10 mg/day, and a combination of angiotensin-conversion enzyme inhibitor (Captopril 300 mg daily), Indapamide 1,5 mg daily but experienced several hypertension peaks and hypotension. She adhered to treatment, was neither using traditional herbal medication nor illicit drugs, had no known family history of endocrine disorders and she did not smoke. At admission, his blood pressure was 200/120 mm of Hg. His body mass index was 31 kg/m². Physical examination was unremarkable. Fundoscopic examination of the eye revealed hypertensive retinopathy stage 2 of Kirkendall classification. Electrocardiography and echocardiography found slight left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cardiac output. Laboratory tests found an hypokalemia= 3,5 mmol/l, an elevated creatinine level at 120µmol/l with normal fasting glycemia and lipid profile.\nLaboratory evaluation was significant for elevated 24-h urinary catecholamine levels (3,5 times the upper normal levels). Ultrasound and Computed Tomography-scan showed kidneys with normal size, good cortical index, and normal vessels. In addition, neither computed tomography nor meta-iodo-benzyl-guanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy detected any catecholamine-producing tumor in or outside the adrenal glands.\nOn further questioning, she admitted to a long history of loud snoring and day time somnolence. His Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) was 16, suggesting excessive daytime sleepiness (normal < 10). Subsequently, a home-based overnight polysomnography showed evidence of severe OSA with an apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) of 30 events/hour (normal < 5).\nWe stopped slowly Acebutolol and Indapamide, continued the angiotensin-conversion enzyme inhibitor and Calcium channel blockers and added Prazosine 5 mg daily to patient's treatment. Following 3 weeks of overnight continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, the patient recorded daily self-measured blood pressure at home with a semi-automatic sphygmomanometer. All blood pressure measures were under 130/80 mm of Hg like the one measured during consultation. Three months later, a new fundoscopic eye examination realized, showed regression of retinopathy to stage 1 and his urinary cathecolamine levels normalized. She had felt better without any symptom, we reduced captopril to 200 mg /day and stopped prazosine and amlodipine to prevent hypotension episodes and she had a stable blood pressure within normal ranges even after exercise."
