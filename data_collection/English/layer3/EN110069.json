  "text": "14 year old Kenyan girl of African descent presented to hospital with a weeklong complaint of lower abdominal pains associated with tenesmus. She had reduced appetite and poor intake of food due to the colicky pains. There was no abdominal distension but she had observed some suprapubic fullness. She did not have constipation, diarrhoea, vomiting or fevers. Her urinary habits were normal. She had never had her menstrual periods but she had developed secondary sexual characteristics. On examination, she was in severe pain, walking stooped over and had moderately tender suprapubic mass corresponding to a uterus at 16 weeks. Rectal examination revealed an anterior mass. Perineal examination revealed a bulging imperforate hymen exaggerated on valsava manoeuvre. Pelvic ultrasound done revealed distended uterus and vagina all filled up with homogenous thick fluid. A diagnosis of hematocolpometra was made. In theatre, an X-shaped incision of the hymen was made under anaesthesia and approximately 600mls of thick chocolate coloured blood evacuated. The edges of the hymen were everted and anchored by Vicryl 2/0 sutures. Analgesic cream and prophylactic oral antibiotics were prescribed. She made uneventful recovery and was doing well at 1 month. She was however lost to follow-up after that."
