  "text": "A 41-year-old male suffering from partial refractory temporal lobe epilepsy was operated in May 2017. A right amygdala, hippocampus, and temporal pole selective resection was performed. He experienced intense PTSD symptoms 1 month after surgery. He complained about repetitive intrusive memories of abuse. The PTSD checklist score was equal to 62/80. He reported a history of childhood abuse: physical and emotional abuse as well as emotional negligence, assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. No other medical history was recorded. He never complained about PTSD or any other psychiatric symptoms before surgery."
