  "text": "A 74 year old female had a left renal mass under observation for 4 years, during which time she was imaged repeatedly using ultrasound and CT scans. There has been no evidence of metastases, and the lesion has demonstrated a steady pattern of growth over the 4-year period. Fine needle aspiration histologically confirmed RCC. Following a multidisciplinary review, the patient was recommended for SBRT as she was not considered a surgical candidate. Treatment was planned for an ablative 42Gray (Gy) to be delivered in 3 fractions at 14Gy/fraction as part of a clinical trial. Our patient presented to the emergency department (ED) suffering left flank pain, fever and vomiting within 3 h of the first fraction of SBRT. CT showed the mass to have markedly increased in size, measuring 8.7 × 8.1 × 7.0 cm, from 6.5 × 5.4 × 5.6 cm. It was reported as an internal haemorrhage into the malignancy. The patient was admitted for analgesia, anti-pyretics, and transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells. The patient recovered without any further intervention but radiotherapy was discontinued. The patient was alive and free from disease progression two years after the aborted treatment."
