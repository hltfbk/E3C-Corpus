  "text": "We report the case of a 14-month-old child who developed a progressive swelling of the right parotid, associated with systemic symptoms and abnormal blood tests. During diagnostic work-up, cervical, intraparotid, and unilateral hilar lymphadenopathies were found. Histopathological and immunohistochemistry studies of a cervical lymph node biopsy established the diagnosis of RDD, with positive PCR for Epstein - Barr virus on the biopsy specimen. Oral steroid therapy was started with progressive reduction in size of all lesions, resolution of systemic symptoms, and normalization of blood tests."
