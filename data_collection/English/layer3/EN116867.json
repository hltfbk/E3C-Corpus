  "text": "A 40-year-old North African man was admitted to our hospital with a gastric submucosal mass. An endoscopic ultrasound revealed a unilocular cystic mass located in the muscular layer. Its content was echogenic suggestive of mucus. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the liquid nature of the cyst and showed a high ratio of proteins. Based on these observations, the diagnosis of bronchogenic cyst was confirmed. An endoscopic monitoring was decided rather than surgery because of the small size of the cyst and the absence of symptoms."
