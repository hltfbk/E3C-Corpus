  "text": "A 35-year-old Sri Lankan female presented with long standing history of intermittent headache with recent worsening. A diagnosis of migraine was made and due to poor response to other medication was initiated on topiramate. Two weeks later patient developed visual impairment which was finally attributed to topiramate. Following discontinuation of the drug, within 3 days the symptoms started to improve with full recovery in 10 days."
