  "text": "A Russian woman 48 years old presented enlarging lump on her left breast for the last 5 years. She was diagnosed as stage IV low-differentiated breast cancer luminal B and had a history of 4 cycles chemotherapy. Patient getting worsening and no response to chemotherapy. We decided to perform palliative radical mastectomy to improve quality of life. Primary skin closure was not possible due to the wide defect of skin and soft tissue. We decided to use TA flap to cover the defect. Histopathology result was compatible with SCC."
