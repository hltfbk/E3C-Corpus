  "text": "We report a case of anterior spinal cord syndrome due to aneurysm of the thoracic aorta with a mural thrombus. A 64Â year old male presented with sudden onset paraparesis with a sensory level at T1 with preserved sense of proprioception and vibration. The MRI panspine revealed increased T2 intensity in the anterior portion of the spinal cord from C5 to T10 level with characteristic 'owl eye' appearance on axial imaging. The CT aortogram detected aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aortic, arch and descending thoracic aorta with significant intimal irregularities, calcified atherosclerotic plaques and a small mural thrombus."
