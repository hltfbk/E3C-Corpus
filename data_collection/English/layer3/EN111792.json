  "text": "We report a case of tracheal CXPA in a 55-year-old woman, who presented with a more than 3-mo history of progressive dyspnea. Computed tomography of the neck and thorax revealed an inhomogeneous, broad-based lesion arising from the tracheal wall on the right side. Endoscopy revealed a subglottic neoplasm causing up to 90% luminal stenosis. The tumor was resected using a high-frequency electrosurgical snare combined with argon plasma coagulation. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor was a CXPA of the trachea."
