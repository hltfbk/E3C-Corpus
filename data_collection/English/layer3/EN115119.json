  "text": "We reported an additional case and reviewed the existing literature. A 70-year-old woman presented with a large painful radiolucent mandibular lesion from the right canine to the left angle area through the midline. No metastatic lymph nodes or distant metastases were detected. She underwent wide surgical resection and reconstruction with a composite fibula free flap. She had no recurrence or metastasis after 18 months."
