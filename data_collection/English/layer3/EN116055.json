  "text": "A 57-year-old Turk man was seen at our clinic at the end of the first postoperative month after cataract surgery. He presented with eye redness, pain and decreased visual acuity. His ophthalmologic examination revealed moderate tyndall and a mild flare in the anterior chamber. Hypopyon in the capsular bag posterior to the intraocular lens was seen in the second postoperative month. Despite topical and subconjunctival bacterial endophthalmitis treatment, there was no improvement in the clinical situation. Candida pelliculosa was isolated from a sample culture obtained from the anterior chamber. Oral fluconazole could not be administered because of increased liver enzyme levels and intravenous amphotericin B could not be administered because of an allergic reaction. Intraocular lens explantation, pars plana vitrectomy and anterior chamber lavage by rupturing the posterior wall of the microabscesses were performed. Intravitreal and intracameral amphotericin B injections were given four times in addition to surgical interventions. The patient has been followed for 2 years and his best-corrected visual acuity was 0.4 at the last visit."
