  "text": "A 32-year-old Chinese woman diagnosed with ATLL with myeloid antigen expression received HSCT from her human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sister and presented with two lesions in her right breast 6Â months later. Pathology investigation revealed breast relapse, with complete remission on the basis of bone marrow findings. Combined modality treatment including chemotherapy and local radiotherapy helped achieve complete remission with mild side effects."
