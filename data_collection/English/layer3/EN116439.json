  "text": "A 35-year-old Chinese woman presented to the Emergency Department with left hemiparesis, pain and numbness of her arms and weak radial pulses. Her laboratory results showed an elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and subsequent digital subtraction angiography demonstrated narrowing and occlusion of the major branches of her aortic arch. We report the case of a patient with Takayasu arteritis presenting with a massive cerebral ischemic infarct and review the current literature on this topic."
