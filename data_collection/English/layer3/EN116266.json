  "text": "A 52-year-old woman with a previously diagnosed refractory celiac disease resistant to steroids and immunosuppressive drugs presented to our hospital for a rapidly growing, painful inflammatory skin lesion of the left leg. Physical examination revealed a painful lesion with focal ulceration, necrosis and pus discharge with active inflammatory borders at the external part of the left leg. Histological evaluation of a skin biopsy and analysis of inflammatory cytokines and matrix-degrading proteases in lesional skin samples confirmed the clinical suspicion of pyoderma gangrenosum. Treatment with oral prednisone was rapidly followed by a complete healing of the skin lesion but no improvement of symptoms/signs of malabsorption."
