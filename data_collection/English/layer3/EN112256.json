  "text": "A 21-year-old mare which belonged to the didactic herd of The Faculty of Veterinary Medicine underwent BAL procedure for training purposes. Clinical examination prior to the procedure did not reveal any abnormalities and the horse had been classified as healthy. The horse was sedated with 0.01 mg/kg of detomidine and 0.01 mg/kg of butorphanol. The silicon BAL catheter was passed through the nasal passage into the trachea and then into the bronchus. Before catheter was wedged, the mare began to cough heavily and massive haemorrhage from mouth and nostrils occurred. Despite fluid therapy, shock occurred within 15 min and the mare was euthanized. Upon necropsy, site of hemorrhage was identified in the left lobar caudal bronchi, from a large blood vessel running directly beneath the bronchial wall. Upon histology, a chronic lympho-plasmocytic inflammatory process in left bronchi was identified. Moreover, Masson's trichrome staining revealed severe, perivascular fibrosis."
