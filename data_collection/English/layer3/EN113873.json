  "text": "A 69-year-old woman underwent an arthroscopic subacromial decompression and rotator cuff repair for a torn supraspinatus tendon. While performing the subacromial decompression and after swapping the portals from lateral to posterior, the metal platelet of the electrocautery device got detached from the instrument and lost in the operation field. Several attempts to visualize the lost platelet with the camera failed. Finally, intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging was used to detect the platelet. To confirm the definitive whereabouts of the platelet, two spinal needles were positioned perpendicular to another under x-ray control, both pointing at the missing platelet. After determining the exact location, the platelet could finally be visualized with the camera and removed. Due to this incident, the operation time was extended extensively, and the patient as well as the theatre team was exposed to an unnecessary amount of radiation."
