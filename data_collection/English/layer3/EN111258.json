  "text": "This case report observed a family that presented with MEN1 p.L105Vfs mutation, and two of the family members had been diagnosed with thymic neuroendocrine tumor combined with MEN1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a mutation in the MEN1 gene has been reported. The proband presented with thymic neuroendocrine tumor, parathyroid adenoma and rectum adenocarcinoma. The son of the proband presented with thymic neuroendocrine tumor, gastrinoma, hypophysoma and parathyroid adenoma. Genetic testing revealed the frameshift mutation p.L105Vfs, leading to the identification of one carrier in the pedigree (the patient's younger sister). The proband then underwent parathyroidectomy at the age of 26 years (in 1980) for a parathyroid adenoma. Subsequently, the patient underwent thymectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The patient is now 64 years old, still alive and still undergoing Lanreotide therapy."
