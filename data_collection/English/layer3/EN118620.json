  "text": "In this report we present a patient with a cavitary lesion at his right upper lobe, found by chance on chest radiography. Computed tomography of the chest revealed the characteristic findings of a mucocele with distal oligemia and hyperlucency of the affected lung parenchyma. Further examination including bronchoscopy virtually excluded other possible disorders and the diagnosis of congenital bronchial atresia was established."
