  "text": "We report the case of a 53-year-old male patient with a history of mental disability and pronounced scoliosis, who presented with a Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia with protrusion of the ascending colon and the right ureter. The hernia was repaired via a dorsal, extraperitoneal approach. The hernia gap with a diameter of approximately 1 cm was closed with insertion of a 6.4 × 6.4 cm PROCEED™ VENTRAL PATCH (Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany). The operating time was 33 min and the patient was discharged the next day and showed no signs of recurrence at 1-year follow up."
