  "text": "We report the case of a 15-month-old Caucasian boy presenting with abdominal distension as the only clinical symptom. On examination, an ill-defined abdominal mass was found. This was confirmed on ultrasound to be a multiseptated cystic mass with a solid element, arising from the right side of the abdomen. Despite further imaging, the origin of the mass could not be identified. The mass was suspected of malignancy but all blood tests and tumour markers were normal. The mass proved to be a diagnostic challenge. The renal origin of the mass was only confirmed at surgery."
