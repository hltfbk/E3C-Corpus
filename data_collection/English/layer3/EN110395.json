  "text": "A 13-year-old, living in a rural area, with no cardiovascular disease history, was admitted to the pediatric emergency department for dyspnea, with the notion of thoracic trauma by a horse kick six days earlier. The physical examination finds an orthopneic patient with signs of right heart failure and an ecchymotic lesion regarding the epigastric area. Cardiac auscultation revealed holosystolic murmur. The electrocardiogram showed a complete right bundle branch block and polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles. The chest X-ray was unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed an apical muscular VSD associated to severe tricuspid regurgitation, a dilated right atrium, and normal left ventricular function. The child was referred for surgery. He underwent, through a median sternotomy, an open heart surgery using routine cardiopulmonary bypass between the ascending aorta and the two laced vena cava veins. There was a small pericardial effusion and a myocardial contusion. After aortic cross-clamping and myocardial protection, the right atrium was opened. Tricuspid valve repair was performed with reimplantation of the ruptured papillary muscle and a devega annuloplasty. The complete closure of the interventricular septal defect could not be achieved because of its situation which rendered it inaccessible. The immediate postoperative period was uneventful with a short stay (48 hours) in the intensive care unit (ICU). At the 6 month follow up echocardiography showed satisfactory leaflet coaptation without tricuspid regurgitation and persistence of a small left to right shunt which will be re-evaluated."
