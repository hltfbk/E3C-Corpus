  "text": "Case 1. A 45-year-old Japanese female presented with a left choroidal melanoma and an abnormal lesion adjacent to the first cervical (C1) lamina confirmed by a PET scan (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax] =9.9 g/ml). MRI of the neck also detected a soft tissue mass (14.6 × 7.7 × 7 mm) adjacent to the C1 lamina. The choroidal melanoma was treated by heavy carbon ion radiotherapy. Although the size of the C1 soft tissue tumor remained unchanged, a CT-guided biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of the neck mass as a T-GCT. Case 2. A 15-year-old Japanese male with multiple type 1 neurofibromatosis presented with a soft tissue mass (26.1 × 24.7 × 11.5 mm) of the extra-articular hip joint that was coincidentally detected by FDG PET/CT during examination of a mediastinal soft tissue mass. SUVmax of the mediastinal lesion was 2.6 g/ml and of the hip lesion was 12.8 g/ml. Thus, differentiation from a malignant tumor, such as a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, was necessary. An open biopsy was performed, and the frozen section was diagnosed as T-GCT. The tumor was excised, and the final histological diagnosis confirmed T-GCT."
