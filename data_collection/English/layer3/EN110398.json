  "text": "A 26-year-old man presented with recurrent epigastric pain evolving since three months associated with intermittent jaundice and fever. There was no history of vomiting, anorexia or change in bowel habits. Physical examination was normal and laboratory values were normal. A Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed the presence of 3.5Ã—3 cm cystic mass within the second portion of the duodenum near the head of the pancreas without pancreaticobiliairy ductal dilatation. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed a double layered wall of the second part of the duodenum with a cystic lesion. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed that the cyst was confined to the duodenum and did not involve the intra-pancreatic portion of the common bile duct. These appearances are consistent with the diagnosis of a DD. The patient underwent an open abdominal exploration by laparotomy. A limited duodenotomy was performed on the anterior surface of the second portion of the duodenum. We found three-cm spherical structure adjoined to the duodenal wall just near the biliopancreatic ampulla. These findings were again suggestive of a duodenal duplication. The duodenal duplication was fully mobilized and totally resected. The post operative course was uneventful. Histological findings from the resected cyst revealed duodenum like mucosa that displayed a distinct layer of smooth muscle and macked villi structure without signs of malignancy."
