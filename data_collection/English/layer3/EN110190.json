  "text": "A 34 years old woman was diagnosed in 1991 with PBC. The diagnosis was established on 3 criteria: elevation of γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (APL), presence of antimitochondrial antibodies and histological findings on liver biopsy. In 2005, the patient underwent an orthotropic LT for rebellious itch to medical treatment.\nShe received immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate. Histology of her explanted liver showed features typical of PBC with non suppurative cholangitis, paucity of bile ducts and annular fibrosis. There were no lesions to suggest any overlap with AIH.\nPostoperative evolution was generally satisfactory. She never experienced an episode of rejection.\nSeven years after transplantation, she displayed alterations of hepatic profile: ALT increased to 270 U/L (normal range (NR) =40), AST increased to 200 U/L (NR=40), APL increased to 180 U/l (NR=130) and γ-GT increased to 50 U/L (NR=35) without elevation of bilirubin.\nUltrasonography using Doppler, cholangiography and liver computed tomography were normal, excluding biliary or vascular complications. Viral hepatitis A, B and C markers were negative as well as IgM antibodies for EBV, CMV and HSV. Tests for anti-nuclear antibody (AAN), antibody to liver/kidney microsomes type 1, smooth muscle antibody (SMA) and SLA/LP autoantibodies were all negative whereas IgG level were increased up to 2 times upper limit of normal. Antimitochondrial antibodies were positive at a level > 1/80. At the time of presentation, she did not receive any medication except immunosuppressive therapy which included tacrolimus (2 milligrams twice a day), with an average trough blood level of 7.2 ng/mL and mycophenolate (2 grammes a day). A liver biopsy was performed and the pathological examination showed a portal and periportal hepatitis with lymphocytes and plasma cells disrupting the limiting plate. There was bridging centrilobular necrosis without duct damage or loss. These finding were suggestive of de novo AIH. The international AIH Group (IAIHG) score was 13, thus falling into the category of probable AIH. The HLA DR3 and DR4 have not been sought and have not been taken into account for the calculation of this score.\nPrednisone was started at a dose of 0.5 mg per Kg per day. The patient responded rapidly with normalization of aminotransferases at week 4 and a decrease of cholestasis. At week 8 of treatment, the patient suddenly interrupted corticosteroids. Her liver function again was abnormal with an increase of aminotransferase to 4 times normal. The steroids were reintroduced at the same dose allowing rapid normalization of aminotransferases. Using the scoring system of IAIHG, the patient had probable AIH (pretreatment score 13, post treatment score 15)."
