  "text": "Herein, we report a case of a 48-year-old Thai male with a large painful mass in his axilla for one year without apparent neurological deficit. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large heterogeneous mass encasing entire posterior cord of left brachial plexus and axillary artery. The tumor tissue from core needle biopsy histologically demonstrated the sheets and cords of relatively uniform tumor cells with foamy cytoplasm and round to oval hyperchromatic nuclei without atypia. The mitotic count was 0 per 50 high power field. A final diagnosis of glomus tumor of uncertain malignant potential was rendered. Complete surgical resection was performed, followed by adjuvant radiation due to positive margin. Neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis was observed at 2-year follow up. Unfortunately, postoperative incomplete brachial plexopathy without signs of re-innervation by electromyography was persisted. Later nerve grafting reconstruction was performed, followed by ongoing neurological rehabilitation."
