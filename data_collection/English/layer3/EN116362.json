  "text": "A 52-year-old Caucasian woman presented with abdominal pain, vomiting and weakness nine days after arthroplasty and heparin use. Hyperkalemia, low cortisol and high adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were found, indicating adrenal insufficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging of the upper abdomen was compatible with preceding adrenal haemorrhage. Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were administered. Review of the literature revealed 36 cases of postoperative adrenal haemorrhage which are presented briefly."
