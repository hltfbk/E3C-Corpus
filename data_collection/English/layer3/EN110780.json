  "text": "A 41-year-old man with a history of HES was transferred to our hospital due to an acute onset of abdominal pain. During the treatment course of HES, this patient received CMV-DNA test with a result of < 2000 copies/ml. Computed tomography (CT) suggested colon perforation. An emergency surgery was performed immediately. Pathological diagnosis revealed CMV infection and infiltration of eosinophils. This patient received both anti-CMV therapy and immunosuppression therapy. Subsequently, the patient recovered and was discharged 25 days after the operation."
