  "text": "A 32-year-old woman had left eye RAO and a bilateral visual field defect after CaHA injection into the glabella region. Topical and systemic intraocular pressure lowering agents, isovolemic hemodilution, globe massage, and anticoagulation with acetylsalicylic acid were prescribed. Carbogen inhalation and oral corticosteroids were also given. In addition to the above therapies, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was implemented as adjuvant treatment. The final best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the left eye improved from hand motion at 15 cm to 0.1. Improved retinal circulation and decreased retinal vessel leakage were found in the follow-up fluorescein angiography. However, there were still multiple emboli in the conjunctival and retinal arteries."
