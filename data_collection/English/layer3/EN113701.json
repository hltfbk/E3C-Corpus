  "text": "We report our experience in treating a 77-year-old male patient with necrotizing fasciitis after high-dose rate brachytherapy plus external beam radiation for prostate cancer. The patient was referred to our hospital with complaints of inguinal swelling and fever. He had a past history of radiotherapy for prostate cancer and subsequent transurethral operation for a stricture of the urethra. Computed tomography showed extensive gas within the femoral and retroperitoneal tissues and pubic bone fracture. Surgical exploration suggested that necrotizing fasciitis was caused by urosymphyseal fistula."
