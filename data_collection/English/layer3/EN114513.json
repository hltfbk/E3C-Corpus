  "text": "Epistaxis and persistent clinical-biochemistry test-result abnormalities prompted liver biopsy in a boy, with molecular study of FGG in him and his parents. He was treated with the autophagy enhancer carbamazepine, reportedly effective in FSD, and with ursodeoxycholic acid thereafter. Inclusion bodies in hepatocellular cytoplasm stained immune-histochemically for fibrinogen. Selective analysis of FGG found the heterozygous mutation c.1201C > T (p.Arg401Trp), absent in both parents. Over more than one year's follow-up, transaminase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activities have lessened but not normalized."
