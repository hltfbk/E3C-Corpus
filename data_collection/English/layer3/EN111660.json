  "text": "A 65-year-old African American female with no past medical history of pituitary disease presented to the emergency department (ED) with nonspecific abdominal pain that was thought to be secondary to fecal stasis and subsequently improved with laxatives. She also reported atypical chest pain that was concerning for unstable angina. She was started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and intravenous (IV) heparin. Later, coronary catheterization showed no significant coronary artery disease (CAD). Twelve hours after the procedure, the patient developed acute complete left oculomotor nerve palsy with a severe headache. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed a large pituitary mass. Pituitary apoplexy was suspected and the patient eventually underwent a successful trans-sphenoidal pituitary resection."
