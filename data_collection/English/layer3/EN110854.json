  "text": "We describe 3 patients with COVID-19, two females aged 62 and 66 years and a male 55 years, who had low-grade fever during COVID-19 convalescence. All 3 patients had no other discomfort or comorbidities during low-grade process. Lesions on computed tomography in all 3 patients had resolved during this period. Two patients tested negative on two consecutive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 tests with an interval of at least 24 h between tests. Body temperature in all 3 patients returned to normal after several days without treatment, and fever recurrence was not observed."
