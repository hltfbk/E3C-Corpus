  "text": "A 26-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) had very short telomeres. Sequencing identified a single heterozygous mutation in the H box of the patient's TERC gene. The same mutation was also present in his father and his son, demonstrating that it was germline in origin. The telomere length in the father's blood was shorter compared to age-matched healthy controls, while it was normal in the son and also in the sperm cells of the patient. In vitro experiments suggested that the mutation was responsible for the telomere shortening in the patient's leukocytes and contributed to the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure in our patient."
