  "text": "Herein, we present an unusual case of a patient manifesting with acute heart failure, secondary to thrombus formation in a porcine aortic bioprosthesis which was implanted 11Â months prior to hospitalization. Due to the patient's poor heart function and intraoperative findings, thrombectomy was performed. For our best knowledge, cases of early bioprosthetic valve thrombosis presenting with acute heart failure have seldomly been reported."
