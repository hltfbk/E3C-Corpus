  "text": "This case report describes a 4-year-old girl who was admitted for an acute episode of lower respiratory tract infection associated with severe dyspnoea, polypnoea, and severe anaemia (haemoglobin levels, 5.9Â g/dL). She had a history of previous similar episodes, with anaemia treated unsuccessfully with iron supplementation and managed through repeated blood transfusions in the acute phase. She did not experience haemoptysis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax showed ground-glass opacity suggestive of pulmonary haemorrhage. After other causes of intra-alveolar haemorrhage were excluded, IPH was confirmed by the presence of siderophages in bronchoalveolar lavage. Immunosuppressive corticosteroid treatment was immediately started with a good clinical response."
