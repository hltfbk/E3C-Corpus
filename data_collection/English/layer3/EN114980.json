  "text": "A 74-year-old male, history of a left A2 aneurysm, presented after a motor vehicle accident at low speeds. Imaging was concerning for a possible traumatic brain contusion, an aneurysmal hemorrhage given history of left A2 aneurysm, or a hemorrhage from an underlying tumor given profound edema. The patient was discussed at the brain tumor board, where the plan was to address the aneurysm followed by resection of the mass versus close monitoring with subsequent imaging. The high risk of rehemorrhage, given the real possibility of an aneurysmal hemorrhage, motivated prompt treatment of the aneurysm. The patient was taken to the angiography suite; an anterosuperiorly projecting azygous A2 aneurysm, measuring 4.5 mm Ã— 5.5 mm with a neck width at 3.5 mm and a small daughter sac, was completely obliterated with primary coiling. The following day, he underwent a left craniotomy along a forehead skin crease for mass excision. Final pathology revealed glioblastoma. The patient recovered well from both procedures, with a baseline neurological exam. The patient subsequently underwent hypofractionated radiation and temodar."
