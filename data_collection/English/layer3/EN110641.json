  "text": "We present our analysis of 17 patients who were admitted to our hospital from January 2014 to December 2018. All tumors were located in the corpus and antrum of the stomach, close to the lesser curvature of the stomach. The tumors originated from the anterior wall in nine cases and from the posterior wall of the stomach in eight cases. Laparoscopic segmental gastrectomy and end-to-end anastomosis between the proximal and the distal residual stomach were used in all patients. The mean operative time was 112.4 min. The mean length of hospital stay was 4.6 d. Mean operative blood loss was 73.5 mL. There were no leaks, no postoperative bleeding nor need for reintervention. Mean postoperative follow-up was 35.4 mo. The Visick grading index showed fewer gastrointestinal symptoms 3 mo after surgery. Two patients (11.8%) had reflux esophagitis and gastritis."
