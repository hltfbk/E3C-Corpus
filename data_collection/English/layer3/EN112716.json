  "text": "We hereby report a case of 11-year-old male who presented with hepatic glycogenosis mimicking Mauriac's syndrome. The patient was admitted at our Pediatric Diabetes Clinic for marked hepatomegaly, short stature and for the poor metabolic control. Blood investigations and liver tests excluded most of major causes of hepatopathy. A liver biopsy allowed us to make diagnosis of hepatic glycogenosis. To control hyperglycaemia, initially we titrated daily insulin dosage, and then intravenous insulin treatment was practiced with the consequent normalization of liver enzymes."
