  "text": "An 87-year-old woman presented with rapidly progressive renal failure and severe leg edema. She was diagnosed with AAV and treated with glucocorticoid and heparin calcium to prevent deep vein thrombosis. Eight days after the start of heparin calcium, her platelet count decreased and the anti-platelet factor 4-heparin complex antibody was strongly positive (>5.0 U/mL; the cutoff point of the anti-platelet factor 4-heparin complex antibody evaluated by the latex turbidity assay is 1.0 U/mL). She was diagnosed with HIT and treated with argatroban. Subsequently, her platelet counts increased gradually."
