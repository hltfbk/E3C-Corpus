  "text": "A 74-years old female underwent redo surgery due to a right-sided recurrent nodular goitre. The signal latency on electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve at the level of the carotid artery bifurcation was 3.75 ms. Further dissection revealed a nonrecurrent but ascending course of the inferior laryngeal nerve. Caused by the recurrent goitre, the nerve was elongated to about 10 cm resulting in this long latency."
