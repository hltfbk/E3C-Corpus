  "text": "We report the case of a 46-year-old Thai female who presented with consecutive bilateral femoral neck fractures following minor trauma within a 3-year period and received cementless bipolar hemiarthroplasties. Her phenotypic expression included Achilles tendon masses, childhood-onset cataracts, intellectual disability, and cerebellar ataxia. A brain computed tomography showed non-enhancing hypodense lesions in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres with mild brain atrophy. Histopathology from an Achilles tendon biopsy revealed tendinous xanthoma and molecular analysis confirmed a homozygous nonsense mutation, c.1072C>T (p.Gln358Ter), in exon 6 of the CYP27A1 gene. The intra-operative crack of a calcar femorale was a major complication during both prosthetic insertion surgeries and warranted cerclage wiring. At the 7-month follow-up of the right hip and the 41-month follow-up of the left hip, postoperative radiographs showed well-fixed and well-aligned prostheses. Independent household ambulation could be resumed with Harris hip scores of 81 points equally."
