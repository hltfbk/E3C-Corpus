  "text": "We report a rare case of a unicornuate right uterus with rudimentary non-communicating (functional) cavitary left horn (class U4a) in a 17-year-old girl who was diagnosed with VACTERL association. She was presented to our centre with 3 years history of secondary sever dysmenorrhea. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealed a normal uterus on the right side, a 7 × 8 cm left endometrioma, a tortuous dilated fluid-filled structure in the left hemipelvis, mostly represented left-sided hematosalpinx, and a well-defined lesion with thick enhancing wall in the left hemipelvis measuring 6.7 × 5.7 × 5.6 cm with a similar enhancement to the uterus in the right. She underwent laparotomy that showed a right unicornuate uterus with a normal cervix and a rudimentary non-communicating distended left horn. In addition, there was a left endometrioma and left hematosalpinx. Resection of the left communicating horn, left salpingectomy and left ovarian cystectomy were performed. The right tube and both ovaries were preserved. At 9-months follow up, the patient had a regular period and the pain subsided completely."
