  "text": "A 66-year-old man underwent elective repair of a large supra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm and returned 6 months later to our clinic after experiencing a melena with hematochezia. The source of bleeding could not be identified by gastroscopy but the following day he vomited a large volume of blood, rapidly became haemodynamically unstable and died of hypotensive shock. A CT scan on the same day showed an increasing area of low-density soft tissue around the graft wall compared with the previous CT scan images obtained initially after the aortic repair. An aortoenteric fistula was confirmed by autopsy."
