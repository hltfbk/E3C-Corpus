  "text": "We report such a case which was diagnosed and managed by laparoscopy. A 27-year-old male presented with features suggestive of acute appendicitis. Preoperative imaging failed to diagnose the condition. Laparoscopy showed a segment of oedematous and haemorrhagic greater omentum adherent to the parietal wall over the right lower quadrant. The infarcted segment was excised and removed in a non permeable bag through the umbilical port. A short edited video of the operative findings and the procedure executed is also provided."
