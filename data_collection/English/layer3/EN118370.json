  "text": "We present the case of a 41-year-old male Caucasian farmer complaining of acute, progressively worsening low back pain of five days duration. Fever with rigors, malaise and profuse night sweating were added to the symptoms, two days before admission. Magnetic Resonance imaging clearly showed the lesion and blood and tissue cultures were positive for Brucella melitensis."
