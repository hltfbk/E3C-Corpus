  "text": "A 62-year-old woman, following a positive faecal occult blood test and with unremarkable medical history, was admitted to hospital for excision of a large flat neoplastic lesion. Endoscopic biopsy demonstrated a tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia and was decided to proceed with surgical excision by TAMIS. After surgery, short-term outcomes revealed prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, undetectable factor XII activity, fever, and partial dehiscence of rectal wall defect suture. Cross-mixing studies of patient plasma show no correction in either the immediate or incubated activated partial thromboplastin time, indicating the presence of an acquired factor XII inhibitor. Activated partial thromboplastin time and factor XII improved in the following weeks without any specific therapy in addition to antibiotic therapy."
