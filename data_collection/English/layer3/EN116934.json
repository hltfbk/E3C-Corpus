  "text": "We report a 36-year-old man who had suffered membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) in his childhood, later diagnosed with CVID at 35 years of age. He presented at our hospital with signs of proteinuria. A renal biopsy revealed he suffered from focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), possibly due to obesity and hypertension, not CVID - associated MPGN."
