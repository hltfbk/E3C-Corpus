  "text": "A female collegiate gymnast presented with 2-months of anterior knee pain, and initial radiographs revealed a non-displaced patella stress fracture. An magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)was obtained which confirmed the diagnosis and ruled out any patellar tendon or intra-articular pathology. The patient was treated with immobilization, vitamin supplementation, and low-intensity pulsed ultrasound therapy. At 3 months, the patient had complete healing of her fracture and returned to full competition in her sport. After approximately 1year of returning to sport, she unfortunately developed a patella stress fracture in her contralateral knee confirmed by radiographs and MRI. She received the same conservative management plan as before, and at 3 months, she was pain free and returned to full competition in her sport. She is now 3 years from injury on the right knee and 2 years from injury on the left knee and continues to compete at the Division I collegiate level without pain."
