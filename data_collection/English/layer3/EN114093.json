  "text": "A 63-years old men was treated by TURBT in 2008 for a high grade NMIBC, pT1b. Three years later he presented an acute binocular diplopy with right trochlear nerve paralysis, and labial hypoesthesia. Brain scan and MRI were performed finding a clivus infiltration and a pachymeningitis. A vertebral biopsy was performed finding an invasive carcinoma, CK7+/CK20+, TTF1-, PSA-, Thyroglobulin- and GATA3+. The metastatic event was in relation to the high grade NMIBC treated 3 years previously. Palliative chemotherapy was started with cisplatin gemcitabine. After 6 cycles and to date, 4 years later, the patient is therefore considered in complete response."
