  "text": "Herein, we report the case of a 4-year-old boy diagnosed with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. The boy also had syndromic features, such as speech and motor developmental delay, multiple congenital malformations, including distinct facial features, club feet, and cryptorchidism. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a pathogenic mutation in KRAS [c.34G > A, p.Gly12Ser] isolated from peripheral blood DNA. Sanger sequencing confirmed the wild-type sequence in the parents and patient's salivary cell DNA indicating its somatic state. A 7311-kb deletion in 10q22.3-q23.2 was also revealed by chromosomal microarray analysis, which was later proved as a germline de novo variant."
