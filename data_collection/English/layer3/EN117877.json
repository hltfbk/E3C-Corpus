  "text": "A neonate was delivered by vaginal delivery after 29 weeks and three days gestation with breech presentation. In a laboratory study, there were slightly increased levels of liver enzymes but the platelet count and hemoglobin level were normal. An abdomen ultrasonography and CT image demonstrated the cystic mass containing an internal thin septum with compression of the lateral margin of the right hepatic lobe and Morison's pouch. A CT image showed an irregular low-density lesion in the dome of liver that was suspected parenchymal laceration."
