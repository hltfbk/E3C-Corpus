  "text": "A 39-year woman with an 11-year history of systemic sclerosis was referred to our hospital due to three syncopal episodes in the past 6 mo. The results of an electrocardiogram and a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed ventricular tachycardia and left ventricular systolic and ventricular septum segmental motion abnormalities, respectively. The results of an electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm with complete blockage of the left bundle branch. In light of the progressive nature of systemic sclerosis, the presence of a left bundle branch block, and the decreased ejection fraction, a cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator was implanted. The patient's clinical conditions improved, and at the 3-mo follow-up, the patient was free of ventricular tachycardia and all cardiac symptoms."
