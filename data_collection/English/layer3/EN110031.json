  "text": "A 2 day old girl, born at 41 weeks gestation weighting 3,500kg, was referred with a growth in the anterior maxillary alveolus which was noticed at birth. Clinical examination revealed a full term female neonate with a huge, exophytic growth protruding from the oral cavity, measured approximately 4x2 cm in size. The tumor was attached by a large pedicleto the anterior maxillary ridge; the mass was firm in consistency and not tender to digital palpation. The initial management included intravenous fluids and gastric feeding as oral feeding was impossible for this child. The tumor was excised under local anesthesia without a prior biopsy. No other lesions or systemic involvement was found. These were no complication after surgery. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of a completely excised congenital gingival granular cell tumour. Immunohistochemical investigation confirmed the diagnosis."
