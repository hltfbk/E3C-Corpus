  "text": "We found a case of shared psychotic disorder between a 38-year-old male inducer, a Batak tribe with two female recipients, 34 and 36 years from the Batak tribe. They were found to share the same delusions and hallucinations, and inducers could make recipients into trance conditions. These three individuals did not get along with the surrounding community and often carried out activities and perform rituals together."
