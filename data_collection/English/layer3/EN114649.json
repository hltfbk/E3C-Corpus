  "text": "A 60 year old lady was presented to our casualty following a fall at home. She complained of pain in the left hip with deformity and inability to move the limb. The hip was externally rotated and clinical examination revealed anterior dislocation of the hip. X-ray showed associated fracture of the proximal femur extending between base of greater trochanter and head of the femur. Cemented Hemiarthroplasty was done under regional anesthesia."
