  "text": "A 50 year-old female presented at our practice with a three-month history of a productive cough associated with dyspnoea and shortness of breath. A chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed multiple bilateral patchy areas with subsegmental atelectasis in both lungs which was investigated with a bronchoscopy, left thoracoscopy, and a left lung biopsy. Pathological examination of the wedge biopsy of the left upper lobe revealed neoplastic sheets of cell disturbed along the septal vessels, perivascular/peribronchial lymphatics, and the subpleural lymphatics. This lymphangitic carcinomatosis was confirmed to be metastatic from SCC of the cervix that had been diagnosed and treated two years ago. She was treated with systemic Carbo/Taxol chemotherapy and corticosteroids as a palliative measure. Despite temporary improvement, she died 13 months later."
