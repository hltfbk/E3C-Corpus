  "text": "A 75-year-old man with esophageal cancer developed chylothorax after esophagectomy. Conservative treatment was ineffective, and he underwent lymphography with 8.5 mL of Lipiodol. He developed a high fever soon after lymphography, followed by severe ARDS requiring artificial respiration 5 days later. He recovered from ARDS but subsequently developed pulmonary fibrosis and was discharged with domiciliary oxygen therapy 3 months later."
