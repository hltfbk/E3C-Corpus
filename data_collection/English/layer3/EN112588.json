  "text": "We report a case of a GT of the thigh in a 25-year-old female, presenting with a painful mass on the posterior side of her left thigh, evolving for 15 months. She was suffering from pain and hyperesthesia of the underlying skin exacerbated by movements. The patient was successfully treated by excisional biopsy."
