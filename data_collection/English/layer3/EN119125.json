  "text": "We present the case of a 74-year-old man with Castleman's disease. The disease was detected with a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan and a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT study; diagnosis was made with histopathology. After treatment with surgical excision followed by chemotherapy, the disease response was evaluated using both diagnostic techniques. However, only the PET study was able to identify the spread of the disease to the abdominal lymph nodes, which were both enlarged and normal size, and, after treatment, to evaluate the disease response."
