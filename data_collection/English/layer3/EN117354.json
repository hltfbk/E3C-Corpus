  "text": "We present a case of cobalamin deficiency in a 29-year-old Moroccan woman who presented with subacute combined degeneration without evidence of anemia or macrocytosis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord demonstrated abnormal hyperintense signal changes on T2-weighted imaging of the posterior and lateral columns from the medulla oblongata to the thoracic spine. A diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord was considered and confirmed by low serum cobalamin. The patient was treated with vitamin B12 supplements and showed improvement in her clinical symptoms."
