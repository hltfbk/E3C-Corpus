  "text": "We report the case of a 59-year-old hypertensive Caucasian woman who developed two sequential, right- and then left-sided, deep cerebellar hemorrhages. The second hemorrhage followed the first one by 57 days, at a time when her blood pressure was optimally controlled. In spite of these critical sites and short duration between the two bleeds, the patient achieved a relatively good functional recovery. Her brain magnetic resonance angiogram was unremarkable."
