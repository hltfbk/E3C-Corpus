  "text": "Whole-exome sequencing was performed in an 18-year-old female proband with a clinical diagnosis of hypertension with brachydactyly syndrome. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to identify pathogenic copy number variations (CNVs). After bioinformatics analysis and healthy control database filtering, we revealed a heterozygous missense PDE3A variant (c.1346G > A, p.Gly449Asp). The variant was absent in the ExAC database and located in a highly evolutionarily conserved cluster of reported PDE3A pathogenic variants. Importantly, this variant was predicted to affect protein function by both SIFT (score = 0) and PolyPhen-2 (score = 1). After Sanger sequencing, the variant was determined to be absent in the healthy parents of the proband as well as 800 ethnically and geographically matched healthy controls."
