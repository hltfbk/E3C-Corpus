  "text": "We report a case of a 22 year-old gravida IV, para II with an asymptomatic and undiagnosed abdominal pregnancy presumed full term, in a context of health centers under-equipment. She had attended 5 routine antenatal care, but had not performed any ultrasound scan. She had been transferred from a medical center to the Hospital of Ouahigouya (Burkina Faso) for bowel sub-obstruction and intrauterine fetal death, with failure of labor induction. On admission, the hypothesis of uterine rupture or abdominal pregnancy with antepartum fetal demise was considered. A laparotomy was then performed, where an abdominal pregnancy was discovered, and a dead term baby weighing 3300 g delivered. The placenta which was implanted into the ruptured isthmus of the left fallopian tube was removed by salpingectomy. Postoperative follow-up was uneventful."
