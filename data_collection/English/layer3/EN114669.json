  "text": "A press fit modular bipolar hiparthroplasty was performed in a young adult male with nonunion fracture neck of the femur secondary to initial fixation using 6.5mm cannulated hip screws and nonvascularized free fibular strut grafting. Failure to completely remove the fibular strut from the proximal femur lead to difficult negotiation of the femoral stem into the femoral canal and ultimately a perforation in the proximal femur at the level of the lesser trochanter. A revision procedure was done to completely remove the residual fibular graft, and then a fresh press fit modular bipolar hemiarthroplasty was done."
