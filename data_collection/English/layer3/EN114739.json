  "text": "We report the case of a 52-year-old Japanese man who presented with a painless, somewhat diffuse swelling in the left submandibular region. Although the case fulfilled diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD, the diagnosis was not straightforward due to abnormally high levels of serum IL-6. After systematic evaluation of the patient, a final diagnosis of IgG4-RD was established. Since then, a specialist in connective tissue disorders has evaluated the patient on a regular basis. Two years after his initial visit, no disease progress or systemic involvement has been noted."
