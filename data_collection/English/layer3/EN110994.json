  "text": "The patient was a 74-year-old woman who underwent lobectomy of lung cancer 2â€‰years before presentation to our hospital. She was referred to our department for resection of cystic pancreatic tumors, which were diagnosed as IPMN with high-risk stigmata. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a 37-mm-wide cystic tumor with a contrasted solid nodule in the pancreatic head and a 17-mm-wide cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail. We performed a total pancreatectomy for these lesions. According to histopathological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumors were diagnosed as metastatic pancreatic tumors from lung cancer."
