  "text": "An 80-year-old Asian woman with high myopia underwent cataract surgery in the right eye. Posterior capsular rupture occurred during phacoemulsification. At the conclusion of scleral fixation of intraocular lens, expulsive SCH developed. After 1 day, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was hand motion. Ultrasonography revealed massive SCH with central apposition. At 2nd week, decrease in SCH with resolution of central apposition was observed. At 6th week, BCVA improved to 20/120. Ultrasonography and fundus examination revealed complete resorption of the SCH and flat retina. At 1 year, BCVA was 20/50. Fundus was flat without any signs of retinal detachment."
