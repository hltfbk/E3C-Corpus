  "text": "A 41-year-old female was presented with urinary symptoms. There was history of caesarean section. Physical examination revealed an anterior vaginal wall mass. Pelvic MRI showed an inter vesico-vaginal mass, suggesting a leiomyoma. Surgical excision was performed by the vaginal route. There were no postoperative complications. Histopathology examination showed focal endometriosis."
