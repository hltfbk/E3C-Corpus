  "text": "A young adult with bilateral radiation cataract underwent phacoemulsification using a femtosecond laser and implantation of a trifocal IOL. The trifocal IOL was delivered to the operating theatre 30 min before the surgery. The outside temperature was approximately - 7 °C. The IOL package was warmed using a radiator at approximately 35 °C for 15 min. After the optical region was implanted in the eye, cloudiness was observed, which persisted throughout the operation. Complete clearing of the IOL was apparent after three postoperative hours."
