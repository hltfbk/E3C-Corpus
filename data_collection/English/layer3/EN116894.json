  "text": "We report the case of a 47-year-old Caucasian man who had sustained a remote motor vehicle accident injury and relied on long-term tube feeding with a commercial product that wascarnitine-free. He was also on phenytoin therapy for control of his chronic seizures. He developed significant acute psychological and behavioral changes superimposed on his chronic neurological impairment. His ammonia level was found to be elevated at 75 to 100μmol/L (normal <35μmol/L). Phenytoin was found to be at a supra-therapeutic level of 143μmol/L (therapeutic range 40-80μmol/L). After adjusting the dose of phenytoin, other pharmacological and hepatic causes of his hyperammonemia and subacute encephalopathy were excluded. His carnitine levels were found to be low. After initiating carnitine supplementation at 500mg twice daily, the patient's mental status improved, and his ammonia level improved to 53-60μmol/L."
