  "text": "We describe a patient with iliopsoas abscess who presented to the Emergency Department at X Hospital on three separate occasions with non-specific symptoms of thigh pain and fever before finally being admitted for treatment. This case illustrates how the diagnosis can be delayed due to its atypical presentation. Hence, highlighting the need for clinicians to have a high index of clinical suspicion for iliopsoas abscess in patients presenting with thigh pain and fever."
