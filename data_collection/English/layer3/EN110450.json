  "text": "A 27-year-old male, with no previous health problems, was admitted with a 1-week history of painful in the left inguinal region, without fever or any associated signs. He denied any etiologic factors like trauma, surgeries, severe exercise or thrombogenic factors.\nInguinal region, scrotum and prostate were normal to palpation.\nInitial laboratory test, were normal.\nDoppler ultrasonography of left inguinal region demonstrated an expanded vein which contained thrombus with no blood flow at Doppler.\nScrotal Doppler ultrasound and Total abdomen contrast-enhanced CT examination excluded other diseases.\nComplete biology workup was negative, except lupus Anticoagulant was positive. A medical treatment of anticoagulant at a curative dose was started.\nAfter 15 days, the patient's inguinal pain was completely disappeared. Three months later, inguinal ultrasound revealed no residual evidence of spermatic vein thrombosis."
