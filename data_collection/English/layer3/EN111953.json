  "text": "A 50-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 40-d history of bloody mucus in the stool and anal swelling. SRUS was suspected. Rectoscopy revealed a large, severe ulcerous lesion. Histologically, the lesion was characterized as chronic ulcer without clear tumor cells, and the final diagnosis of SRUS was made. The patient was treated with Chinese medicine therapy, with administration of Tong Xie Yao Fang. After 3 wk of treatment, the symptoms improved significantly. At 2-mo follow-up, rectoscopy in a local hospital showed healed ulcer scars without obvious protrusion 3 cm from the anal verge."
