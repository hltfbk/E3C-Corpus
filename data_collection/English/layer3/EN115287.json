  "text": "We report a 32-year-old Iranian male diagnosed with a case of miliary tuberculosis affecting the prostate. The patient was admitted to the hospital with convulsions. Computerized tomography increased the clinical suspicion of miliary tuberculosis extending to the prostate where a trans-rectal urethral biopsy was obtained. The biopsy revealed multiple necrotizing granulomata suggestive of tuberculosis."
