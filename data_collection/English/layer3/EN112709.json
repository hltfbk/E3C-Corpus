  "text": "We report the case of an 83-year-old man, admitted to our hospital for gastroenteritis, complicated by dehydration and severe prothrombin time prolongation due to oral anticoagulant therapy accumulation, who developed hospital-acquired pneumonia; neither of these illnesses responded to several lines of antibiotic therapy. All microbiologic tests were negative, except cytomegalovirus DNA test in blood, which showed high viral load. Antiviral therapy with ganciclovir was then started and a quick favourable response followed. A state of immunodeficiency was excluded, based on normal CD4 count and patient's clinical history."
