  "text": "A 48-year-old man who had been diagnosed with Buerger's disease 12 years ago, and received bilateral below-the-knee amputations for ischemic ulcers of the lower limbs, presented at our clinic due to a sudden loss of visual acuity in the left eye. A fundus exam revealed a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.5 for the right eye and 0.8 for the left eye, arteriolar constriction in both eyes, retinal edema in the inferopapillary area, and splinter hemorrhages and soft exudate in the left eye. We diagnosed the patient as having acute nasal branch retinal artery occlusion in the left eye and bilateral NTG, as a result of the ophthalmologic examination and the other findings."
