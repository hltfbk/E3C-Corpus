  "text": "A 34-year-old female patient who presented with fever and progression of disorder of consciousness was eventually diagnosed with RESLES based on brain imaging. Moreover, clinical features and peripheral smears demonstrating schistocytes and thrombocytopenia confirmed a diagnosis of TTP. RESLES can be improved by plasma exchange therapy."
