  "text": "Two patients with drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy treated with chronic VNS experienced stimulation-related pain in the lower and upper jaw and teeth on the side of stimulation. No evidence of local spread of the stimulation current was present. The pain started with a delay of years after device implantation and weeks after the last increase in the pacing parameters. At the time of onset, the pain was not recognized as VNS-related, leading to extensive examinations. The trigeminal neuralgia-like pain resolved after adjustment of the stimulation current intensity. In one of the patients, the pain disappeared within one to two days following every epileptic seizure. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of late-onset trigeminal pain under VNS revealing a direct link between epileptogenic and pain processes."
