  "text": "The patient presented with scleritis, which did not improve with systemic steroid. Intraocular pressure was elevated, and well demarcated hyper-reflective round lesion were noted in both eyes. He had a history of general ache and concurrent onset of ocular symptoms the day after eating raw meat. Systemic work-ups revealed no remarkable abnormalities except antibody for toxocara. Oral albendazole and steroid were prescribed. The inflammation and swellings resolved without recurrence. In the current case, scleritis with suspect granuloma in the nerve fiber layer seems to be caused by toxocara."
