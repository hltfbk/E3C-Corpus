  "text": "A 79-year-old woman with pain in the left hip joint underwent a revision THA, using HA mesh and ultra high molecular weight polyethylene fiber cable for impaction bone grafting to fill a bone defect in the proximal femur in 2011. There were no abnormal findings clinically or on radiograph until 2014. Moderate osteolysis was observed at the lesser trochanter and the area distal to the greater trochanter on the radiograph in 2015. The synovial fluid culture was negative. On magnetic resonance imaging examination, the margin showed a low-density shell in both the T1- and T2-weighted images, and the inside was a mosaic mass, with mixed low- and high-density are as extending in a multidirectional manner. During surgery, cystic mass covered with a thick membrane was found around the artificial hip joint, and the inside of the capsule was full of solid and fluid hematoma and dark blood. There was no apparent wear and tear debris of the implant. On pathological examination, evidence of chronic hematoma, granulation tissue, and HA debris, interspersed inside the granulation tissue were observed."
