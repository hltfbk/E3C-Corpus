  "text": "A 50-year-old man presented with severe PN and showed symptoms of extreme weakness and sensitivity of both lower limbs. His symptoms gradually worsened over a period of 18 months to such an extent that he was unable to walk. Medication had no effect on his pain or related symptoms. The authors tested the use of a Vibromat clinical vibrator to treat his PN symptoms. The patient was treated using the same modality for five evenly spaced (monthly) sessions."
