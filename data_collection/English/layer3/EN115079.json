  "text": "A 19-year-old Japanese female was brought to our emergency department because of fever and coma. A spinal tap was performed and turbid yellow fluid was collected. A diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was established and the patient was admitted to an intensive care unit. Dexamethasone and Antibiotics were administered and Neisseria meningitides was cultured from the spinal fluid. On day 10, postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging identified enhanced subarachnoid space in the cerebellum. Susceptibility-weighted imaging showed spotty low-intensity signals in the cerebellar tissue, indicating microbleeds. The patient made a full recovery from coma and was discharged without neurological sequelae on day 24."
