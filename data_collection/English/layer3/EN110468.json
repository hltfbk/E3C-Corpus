  "text": "A 52-year-old male patient presented with five months history of effort angina of Canadian cardiovascular society class II. He was a known type II diabetic for the past three years controlled by oral hypoglycemic medicines. Other history was non-significant. Electrocardiography and echocardiography showed no abnormalities but his exercise tolerance test (ETT) was positive for ischemia with significant ST sagging in inferior leads. Hematology and biochemistry profiles were normal. He was booked for a coronary angiogram which showed two right coronary arteries (RCA) arising from a main stem. The second artery had a critical disease in its proximal course with 99% stenosis. The major obtuse marginal (OM) branch had a critical disease in proximal segment and atrioventricular branch was totally occluded. Angioplasty of the diseased vessels with three drug-eluting stents was proceeded and the patient admitted in post-cath ward for the procedural twenty-four-hour observation. Next day he was discharged on dual-antiplatelet drugs."
