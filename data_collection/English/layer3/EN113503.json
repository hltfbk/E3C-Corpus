  "text": "A previously healthy 42-year-old Sri Lankan Sinhalese man was extensively investigated for a prolonged fever of 3 weeks with high inflammatory markers. He had mild tenderness over his neck with cervical lymphadenopathy with no thyrotoxic symptoms or signs. An ultrasound scan revealed an enlarged thyroid with increased vascularity and he had suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone with elevated free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine hormone levels. Fine-needle aspiration cytology confirmed thyroiditis. He responded well to low-dose steroids."
