  "text": "A 32-year-old Sri Lankan female was evaluated for new onset hypertension in association with hypokalemia. She also had features of hyperthyroidism together with high TSH receptor antibodies suggestive of Graves' disease. On evaluation of persistent hypokalemia and hypertension, primary hyperaldosteronism due to right-sided adrenal adenoma was diagnosed. She was rendered euthyroid with antithyroid drugs followed by right-sided adrenalectomy. Antithyroid drugs were continued up to 12 months, after which the patient entered remission of Graves' disease."
