  "text": "A 21-year-old African man with large maxillary and mandibular tumors under palliative care presented with increasing difficulties with eating, speech, and breathing. Surgical debulking was performed, with histology confirming synchronous osteosarcomas of the mandible and maxilla. The patient is well after one year, with no evidence of recurrence, having undergone no further treatment."
