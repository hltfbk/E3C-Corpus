  "text": "We report the case of a 66-year-old female patient with liver metastasis from pancreatic cancer with a pathological diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was elevated to 420.3 U/mL. Computed tomography showed a pancreas mass of 2.7 cm × 2.5 cm and single liver metastasis of 1.4 cm × 1.1 cm in the S6 area. The patient underwent IRE and arterial infusion chemotherapy and received tegafur. The therapeutic effect of the combination treatment has been evaluated as complete response. To date, the patient has survived for > 12 mo and is receiving tegafur as maintenance therapy (at the time this case report was written)."
