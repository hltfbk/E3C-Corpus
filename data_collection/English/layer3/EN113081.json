  "text": "We present a case of this lesion involving the knee joint of a Caucasian woman who was referred to our institution for the evaluation of recurrent right knee pain. Her symptoms have started insidiously 5 years earlier following minor trauma. Recurrent symptomatic knee effusion was the cardinal symptom. Following the surgical excision of the lesion, recurrence occurred 2 years later. The tumor was successfully treated with embolization of its vascular supply."
