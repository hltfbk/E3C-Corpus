  "text": "A 58-year-old man, who underwent surgery to remove a thymoma at the age of 54, was admitted because of speech difficulties. A brain MRI showed multiple lesions involving the frontal lobes, but the CSF finding was normal. Acyclovir was empirically administered, and fever as well as his neurological symptoms fully recovered within a few days. However, 1 week after admission, motor aphasia and mild right hemiparesis reappeared. MRI showed that the lesion involving the left cingulate gyrus expanded in size, and revealed an abnormal signal intensity lesion in the left corona radiata. Laboratory examination found increased CMV pp65 antigen-positive lymphocytes in serum. Antiviral therapy using ganciclovir and immunoglobulin replacement therapy was started. The patient has since been free from any neurological symptoms for 1 year, and lesions demonstrated by MRI are gradually improving."
