  "text": "We described a case of a 44-year-old female with ulcerative colitis who presented with lower abdominal pain and hematochezia. She stopped taking her medicine for ulcerative colitis and started oral indigo naturalis 3Â months before admission. Computed tomography showed segmental edematous wall thickening of the descending and sigmoid colon. Colonoscopy findings revealed erythema, edema, and submucosal hemorrhage, the surface of which presented a dark blue pigmentation. The histologic finding was consistent with ischemic colitis. We therefore considered an ischemic colitis induced by indigo naturalis, and the patient improved after supportive care and withdrawal of indigo naturalis."
