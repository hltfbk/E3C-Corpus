  "text": "A 6-year-old, Caucasian male child complained of persistent back pain for 3 weeks, with lumbar tenderness without neurodeficit. Radiographs showed fourth lumbar (L4) vertebral body collapse. Magnetic resonance imaging showed features suggestive of TB spondylodiscitis. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was raised. In view of the high prevalence rate of TB, on clinical suspicion, empirical first-line ATT (isoniazid + rifampicin + ethambutol + pyrazinamide) was given for 6 months, under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP). In the course of ATT, child developed iliopsoas abscess which was drained surgically. Repeat radiological evaluation showed almost complete L4 body destruction and 10 cm Ã— 8 cm pre-vertebral abscess. ESR was further raised. Vertebral biopsy culture showed growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex susceptible only to capreomycin (Cm). Second-line ATT (moxifloxacin + clofazimine + linezolid + isoniazid + amoxicillin-clavulanate + para-aminosalicylic [PAS] acid) with daily intramuscular Cm was initiated, under the RNTCP Programmatic Management of Drug-Resistant TB initiative. At 3 months, tenderness was absent, ESR decreased, and radiology showed consolidation of L3 and L5 vertebral bodies and their interspace. At 6 months, injectable Cm was stopped, oral ATT continued for 18 months. No major drug-related side effects were noted. At final follow-up, imaging showed complete L4 body absence, intact posterior elements, surrounding bony consolidation, resolution of abscess without neurodeficit, or deformity."
