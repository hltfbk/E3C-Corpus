  "text": "The index case is a 7 years old girl showing Tanner stage 3 and pubic hair stage 1. Her bone age evaluated by TW2 method was 10.3 years. Her hormonal data confirmed the diagnosis of central precocious puberty. Familial medical history revealed precocious puberty in a cousin on paternal side. Paternal grandmother had menarche at the age of 9 years and 6 months and premature menopause when she was 36 years old. Genetic analysis revealed a new mutation (c477_485del; Pro160Cysfs*14) in the maternally imprinted MKRN3. Puberty onset was at 5 years in the other affected female family member. Precocious puberty was well controlled by pharmacological therapy."
