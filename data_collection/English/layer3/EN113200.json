  "text": "Herein, we report the case of a 38-year-old Chinese woman with platinum-refractory advanced ovarian adenosquamous carcinoma who received clinical benefit from poly adenosine diphosphate ([ADP] ribose) polymerase and programmed death-1 inhibitors after failure of prior multiline chemotherapies and antiangiogenic agents. The targeted therapy and immunotherapy-controlled disease deterioration and improved performance status. Thus far, the patient has survived longer than 15 months, and she is taking nivolumab as maintenance treatment."
