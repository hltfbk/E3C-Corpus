  "text": "We report here for the first time the case of a 75-year-old Caucasian man who was treated for both diabetes and acute myeloid leukemia secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome, with a temporal association between glycemic dysregulation and the intake of 5-azacitidine. In fact, 2-3 days after starting each 7-day cycle of 5-azacitidine, he reported higher blood glucose levels, requiring an increased dose of self-administered insulin."
