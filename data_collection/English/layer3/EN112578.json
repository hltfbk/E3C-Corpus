  "text": "A 28-year-old male presented with bilateral anterior column acetabulum fracture following RTA. The patient was initially admitted to emergency and stabilized hemodynamically.

At 1-year follow-up, the patient is able to walk, squat, and do routine activities without pain and fracture healed uneventfully."
