  "text": "A 72-year-old Caucasian male developed an inflammatory collection on the outside of the right thigh where a hip prosthesis had been implanted for 11 years. Culturing a fluid sample from the collection puncture found Staphylococcus hominis and a Gram-positive bacillus unidentified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Sequencing the 16S rRNA gene amplified from both the specimen and the isolate identified A. gerencseriae. Treatment adjusted with amoxicillin and trimethropim-sulfamethoxazole cured the infection."
