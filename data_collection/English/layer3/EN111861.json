  "text": "A 52-year-old woman presented to our hospital with blurred vision in her left eye for approximately 1 wk. Anterior segment and intraocular pressure findings were normal in both eyes. Fundus photography of the left eye showed a seemingly normal adult oculus fundus without any obvious hard exudate or hemorrhage. Optical coherence tomography exhibited a hypo-reflective space beneath both the neurosensory retina and the pigment epithelium layer. The late phase of fluorescein angiography revealed increased leakage. The patient was initially diagnosed with CSC. At follow-up, however, the final diagnosis turned out to be PCV."
