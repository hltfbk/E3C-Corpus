  "text": "A About 25-year-old male presented to Out Patient Department with bruising and swelling over the anterior wall of left axilla. The patient was engineer and amateur weight lifter. Clinically, the swelling was tender, and movements of left arm were restricted. Muscle tear was suspected and hence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was advised which showed tear of tendon of pectoralis major muscle. The patient was treated surgically and has got full range of movements of the arm."
