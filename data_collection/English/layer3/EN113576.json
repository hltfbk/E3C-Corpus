  "text": "The patient, a 40-year-old man, presented to the emergency room because of intense retrosternal discomfort for 3 days and hematemesis for 3 h. The esophagoscopy and thoracic enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed two irregular mural ulcers in the esophagus and a large saccular pseudoaneurysm at the aortic isthmus, respectively. The laboratory examinations confirmed no widespread inflammation and infection. We have successfully performed a successful one-stage hybrid treatment for this patient. Six-month follow-up shows the patient is in good condition and the esophagoscopy reveals the two mural ulcers had completely healed."
