  "text": "An 88-year old patient was hospitalized for surgical removal of two tumorous formations in the head area which have been available for many years. During the dermatological examination in the frontal and parietal area of the head, the presence of two oval pink cystic neoplasms, clinically suspected for epidermal cysts, was found. The lesion located in the frontal area was removed by elliptical excision. The resulting surgical defect was closed by undermining the wound edges and mobilisation of the released skin to the middle of the defect, as the latter being closed by single interrupted sutures. In the second surgical session, the lesion located in the parietal region of the head was also removed under local anaesthesia. A so-called island flap was performed in which the tumour formation was removed by oval excision followed by contouring a triangle in the distal direction and transposition of the undermined triangle to the oval surgical defect. The resulting defect was recovered by single interrupted sutures."
