  "text": "A 62 year-old white British man with a past medical history of a malignant melanoma of the skin underwent a laparotomy for a partially obstructing sigmoid tumour. Intra-operatively, a round, smooth textured black lesion was identified on the anterior surface of the omentum; the nodule was confirmed to be a metastatic malignant melanoma with abundant brown pigment and a focal necrotic area."
