  "text": "A 63-year-old woman with alcoholic decompensated cirrhosis was referred to our hospital for LDLT. She had mild dyspnea on exertion as well as fatigue. Echocardiography and subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a high mPAP (35 mmHg), and she was diagnosed with moderate PPH. We commenced treatment with oral tadalafil for the PPH. A second preoperative echocardiography demonstrated improved PPH, and she underwent LDLT. An intravenous infusion of prostaglandin E1 was introduced instead of tadalafil during and after the operation. The mPAP value showed a rapid decrease in mPAP value to 22 mmHg in 2 days. After discontinuation of the prostaglandin E1, the mPAP value remained 23 mmHg. Postoperative catheterization 2 months after LDLT showed no exacerbation of PPH. She was discharged on foot 70 days after LDLT in good condition and has shown a good clinical condition more than 2 years after LDLT."
