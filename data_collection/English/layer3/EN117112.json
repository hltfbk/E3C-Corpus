  "text": "A 54-year-old Caucasian man presented with nausea and epigastric pain. He had a known history of right-sided Bochdalek hernia which was being managed expectantly. A computerized tomogram revealed the massive hernia with displaced stomach, liver, intestine and omentum into his right thorax. It was believed that our patient had bowel incarceration and he was therefore taken to surgery, where acute cholecystitis and a macronodular liver was identified. A thoracoabdominal approach was used to remove his gallbladder, reduce the herniated viscera and reconstruct his diaphragm. A liver biopsy identified nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the ectopic liver. There were no postoperative complications and at 12 month follow-up, our patient continues to do well."
