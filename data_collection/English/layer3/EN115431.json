  "text": "A 39-year-old female patient with dextrocardia presented with a 5-month history of episodic biliary colic. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a left-sided gallbladder with gallstones. We performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy with our modified technique including port relocation. The operation went well, and our patient recovered satisfactorily."
