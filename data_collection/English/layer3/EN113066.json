  "text": "An 11-year-old girl noticed a small subcutaneous nodule in the iliac region. As the nodule was asymptomatic, it was observed naturally for a year, after which her parents consulted her doctor due to gradual growth of the nodule. The tumor was resected marginally without biopsy by a non-specialized surgeon. Based on the histology of the resected specimen, the tumor was suspected to be a sarcoma. The patient was referred to our hospital where we reinvestigated the histology of the tumor using immunohistochemistry. After confirming diagnosis of the tumor as an AFH, we undertook additional extensive resection in the iliac region where the tumor had developed. There was no evidence of tumor residue in the resected specimen. It has been 3Â years since the operation, and there has been no evidence of recurrence."
