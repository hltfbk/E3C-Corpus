  "text": "A preterm baby girl, first of dizygotic twins, born at 26 weeks of gestation to a 45 year old mother, was prenatally diagnosed with ventriculomegaly on fetal ultrasonogram. At birth the baby had frontal bossing with sun setting eyes and a full anterior fontanel. Initial head ultra-sonography (HUS) showed ventriculomegaly and semilobar holoprosencephaly, which was confirmed by computed tomography scan. Subsequently, the baby developed hydrocephalus that progressively increased. Eventually, the cerebrospinal fluid required drainage and a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was placed."
