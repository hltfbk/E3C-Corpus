  "text": "Here we report a 62-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital with signs and symptoms of intermittent jaundice. Biochemical tests showed higher serum levels of total and direct bilirubin, and normal serum levels of tumor markers and interleukin-6. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography detected a 6 cm × 4 cm × 2.5 cm mass between the hepatoduodenal ligament and the inferior vena cava. The mass was successfully excised and the patient had a complete resolution of symptoms. A diagnosis of idiopathic unicentric CD was made based upon histological examination, which demonstrated the pathological features of CD of mixed type, including hyperplasia of follicular lymphoids with abundant plasma cells, degenerative germinal centers, interfollicular vascularity and hyaline degeneration. The diagnosis was corroborated by immunohistochemical analysis which detected multiple biomarkers."
