  "text": "We present a case of a type 2 endoleak from the internal iliac artery that was not coiled prior to EVAR. This was treated with retrograde embolisation of the internal iliac artery via direct puncture of a branch from the buttock and closure of the arteriotomy was achieved using an Angio-Seal (Terumo) device that was deployed in an off-label manner to allow visualisation."
