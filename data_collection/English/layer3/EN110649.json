  "text": "A 17-year-old female patient sought evaluation in our department with constipation and chronic abdominal pain for 12 years; she had difficulty defecating and had dry stools since she was a child. An abdominal computed tomography revealed two extremely enlarged loops of bowel full of stool-like intestinal contents in the left lower abdomen, which led us to consider the possibility of colonic duplication. A laparoscopic exploration was performed, which revealed a tubular duplicated colon that shared a common opening with the transverse colon. A left hemi-colectomy was performed with a side-to-side anastomosis. The pathologic results confirmed the diagnosis. At the 6-mo follow-up, the patient was doing well without constipation or abdominal pain."
