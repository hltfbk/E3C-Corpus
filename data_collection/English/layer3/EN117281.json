  "text": "In this article, we report the case of a 51-year-old Taiwanese man with dual infection with HBV and HCV prior to renal transplantation. Low-dose interferon (3 to 6 × 106 U/week) and ribavirin (100 mg/day to 200 mg/day) were prescribed following the reactivation of the man's HCV after renal transplantation. Additionally, lamivudine (100 mg/day) was administered concomitantly to prevent HBV reactivation. His initial serum HCV RNA concentration was 5.2 × 106 copies/mL (genotype 2a). After three and one-half years of antiviral therapy, his HCV was successfully eradicated without any episodes of allograft rejection. His serum HCV RNA remained negative six months after withdrawal from interferon and ribavirin treatment. His serum HBV DNA remained undetectable throughout the course of therapy."
