  "text": "A three year old boy presented with valgus deformity of middle finger of right upper limb with an associated ulnar bony swelling at the level of middle phalanx which was noticed two years before and was progressing rapidly since last three months. On physical examination the swellings were found to be bony hard, midly tender and found to have been causing an angulare deformity of the digits. The initial suspicion was of osteochondromatous lesion however the excision biopsy showed the lesion to be of the rare entity of bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation. 1 year follow up showed no progression of angular deformity of the operated digits."
