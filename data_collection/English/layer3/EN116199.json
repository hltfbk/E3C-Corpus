  "text": "We analyzed the medical record, pathologic findings, and radiographic studies of a 14-year-old Hispanic boy who presented to Texas Children's Hospital with a three-month history of progressive spastic paraparesis. Preoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging reports showed a large mass lesion centered at the left T7-8 neural foramen with intra- and extraspinal extension, resulting in severe spinal cord compression and vertebral body erosion, and protrusion into the retropleural space and descending aorta. Our patient underwent a single-stage posterior approach for complete resection of the tumor with reconstruction and stabilization of the vertebral column. The pathological examination was consistent with schwannoma. At the six-month follow-up, our patient had resolution of preoperative symptoms and remains neurologically intact without any radiographic evidence of recurrent tumor."
