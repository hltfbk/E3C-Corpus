  "text": "We report a case of a 73-year-old Japanese female patient with a painful intraosseous leiomyoma involving the proximal tibia. The patient had undergone tumor excision with wide margin, immediate weight bearing was allowed, pain had been relieved and the patient was satisfied with no recurrence, malignant change, distant metastases or functional impairment. We reviewed all published cases of intraosseous leiomyomata in English literature."
