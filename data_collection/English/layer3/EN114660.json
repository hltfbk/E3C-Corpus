  "text": "We report the clinical and radiologic findings of a patellar OC in a 50-year-old female, with a 3-year progression of swelling, not painful, well-defined margins, normal skin, and no neurovascular deficits or functional impairment. The tumor was surgically resected, and histopathological examination did not show malignancy. After 2 years of follow-up, the patient has no complaints and no signs of recurrence."
