  "text": "We report 3 cases of uncemented revision stem fractures. Case 1 is a 77 year old male, Case 2 is a 71- year-old female, case 3 an 82-year-old male. All three patients had significant proximal femoral osteolysis. All three had an extended trochanteric osteotomy for the revision surgery. The hips had remained in-situ for 4, 2 and 5 years respectively prior to fracture."
