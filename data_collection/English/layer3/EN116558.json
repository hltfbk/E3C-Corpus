  "text": "A 42-year-old Korean male patient, who underwent a spinal operation five years previously at the level of L4 to S1, visited our clinic with persistent and aggravating low back pain. An imaging study revealed the focal and diffuse disc protrusion at the level of L4/5 and L5/S1. The clinician decided to perform a lumbar percutaneous epidural neuroplasty. During the procedure, dural adhesion was suspected at the previously operated level, and the neuroplasty catheter was malpositioned into the intradural space on the first attempt. After the catheter was repositioned, the scheduled epidural neuroplasty was completed. Our patient had no definite abnormal neurological signs. But, after a day, our patient complained of severe headache with sustained high blood pressure without neurological disorientation. Computed tomography of his brain showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage-like appearance with intracranial air. Sequential angiography, subtractional magnetic resonance imaging and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed no abnormalities. Follow-up computed tomography after one day revealed no definite intracranial hemorrhage, and our patient was discharged with improved low back pain without neurological deficit."
