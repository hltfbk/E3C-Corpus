  "text": "We report the case of a 68-year-old woman with rectal neoplasms and SIT diagnosed by electronic colonoscopy biopsy and enhanced computed tomography (CT), which showed that there was a soft tissue mass protruding into the lumen in the lower rectal segment, a lesion that involved the serosal layer, multiple enlarged peripheral lymph nodes, and visceral situs abnormalities. Based on the CT images, we reconstructed a 3D model with Mimics to assist with our surgical planning. Then, we performed laparoscopy-assisted radical resection of the rectal neoplasms and total excision of the lesion. Adjuvant chemotherapy with the XELOX regimen (oxaliplatin 150 mg, D1 + Xeloda 1.0 g, Bid, D1-14) was initiated 1 mo after the operation. The patient recovered well after surgery, and her physical condition remained stable."
