  "text": "A 46-year-old male with end-stage renal disease of unknown cause received a cadaveric renal transplant one year ago. Although three antihypertensive medications were administrated, his blood pressure gradually increased to 190/120 mmHg 3 weeks posttransplantation. Also the level of creatinine increased to 194 μmol/L.Color Doppler ultrasonography indicated a decreased resistance index (RI) in intrarenal arteries and increased blood flow of the transplant renal artery, therefore, a vascular complication of TRAS was suspected. Arteriography was performed and demonstrated TRAS caused by stretch of an artery branch, and the TRAS occurred in the distal site of the anastomosis instead of the anastomosis. Percutaneous transluminal bare stent implantation treatment was successfully performed. Satisfactory clinical efficacy with improvement in transplant renal function and renovascular hypertension was achieved after the interventional treatment."
