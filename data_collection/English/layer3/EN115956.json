  "text": "The patient was a 68-year-old Japanese male diagnosed with invasive bladder cancer. Laparoscopic radical cystectomy and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed. On postoperative day 12, he developed a high fever and an acute inflammatory response with redness and swelling in the right inguinal region. He was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis and underwent debridement. On postoperative day 42, a sudden hemorrhage developed from the open wound in the right inguinal region. He was diagnosed with external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm rupture by computed tomography."
