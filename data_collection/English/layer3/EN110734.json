  "text": "We present a rare case of a 41-year-old Chinese female with a right-sided colon adenocarcinoma who harboured a (p.P286R) POLE somatic mutation. Genomic analysis was performed using the Illumina HiSeq Sequencing platform, which, identified MSS tumour with a (c.1093_1169 + 15dup) germline mutation in RAD54L gene and tumour mutation burden of 377.0 Muts/Mb. Based on our report a new mechanism for developing hypermutated colon cancer has been conjectured through a novel RAD54L_POLE DSBR pathway."
