  "text": "A 70-year-old man was diagnosed as having esophageal cancer (Ut, type 0-IIc, T1b/MtLt, type 0-IIc, T1b, N2, M0, cStage II) and was treated by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery. Preoperative CT examination revealed a right aortic arch, and based on the findings of 3D-CT, we classified the right aortic arch as type IIIB1 (Edwards classification), which is the most frequent type of right aortic arch. We performed thoracoscopic esophagectomy via a left thoracic approach with the patient placed in the prone position, cervical esophagogastric conduit reconstruction via the retrosternal route, and three-field lymph node dissection. Although Kommerell's diverticulum could be easily confirmed, the descending aorta took a meandering course, making it difficult for the esophagus to be mobilized and detached and therefore also to identify the ductus arteriosus and left recurrent laryngeal nerve. Intraoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring using NIM-RESPONSE® 3.0 (Medtronic Japan, Tokyo, Japan) allowed the position of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve to be accurately determined, and upper mediastinal lymph node dissection and mobilization of the upper thoracic esophagus were performed safely. Postoperatively, the patient showed no evidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, but needed conservative treatment for anastomotic leakage. The patient was discharged 46 days after the surgery."
