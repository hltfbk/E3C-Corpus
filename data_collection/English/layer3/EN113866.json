  "text": "We present a 24-year-old man who was shot with a shotgun from a distance of 15Â m in an accidental injury. Forty-seven grapeshots were found on his body surface by physical examination. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated large areas of low-density shadows in his right parietal lobe and right temporal lobe with the midline shifting to the left side 2 days later. Afterwards, the patient was transferred to our emergency medical center at Changzheng Hospital in Shanghai. Cranial computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed a high-density shadow in the initial part of the right middle cerebral artery. The branches after the initial part were obliterated. Prompt medical attention and decompressive craniotomy (DC) surgery contributed to the final recovery from cerebral infarction of this patient."
