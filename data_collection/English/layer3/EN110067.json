  "text": "A 30-year-old heterosexual man, without familial and personal history, was diagnosed with rectosigmoid ulcerative colitis since 2010 revealed by chronic bloody diarrhea with abdominal pain and weight loss. He had a 3 pack-year history of smoking (stopped 3 years ago). He was initially treated with oral and local mesalamine with a good response. In 2011, he was treated 3 times with steroids (1mg/kg/day of prednisone) for a moderately active disease without a complete relief of diarrhea. In December 2011, at physical exam, his body mass index was 17kg/m². Abdominal exam was normal. There was no skin lesion. Iron deficiency anemia (11g/dL) and signs of inflammation: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 37mm, c-reactive protein (CRP) 74mg/L were noted. Albumin level was 25g/L. Ileocolonoscopy showed large superficial ulcerations, spontaneous bleeding and pseudo-polyps. Lesions were mainly located in the rectosigmoid colon and the colitis was extended to the hepatic flexure. Histology found clear signs of active UC with no signs of malignancy. Oral corticosteroids were prescribed with a good initial response. At week 4 of corticosteroid therapy, we noted a relapse of bloody diarrhea, inflammation and aggravation of anemia (7,3g/dL). A left-sided colonoscopy didn?t show severe endoscopic signs. Copro-parasitological examinations were negative. Cytomegalovirus testing was negative too. Detection of Clostridium difficile toxins was not done. Intraveinous corticosteroids and parenteral nutrition were prescribed during 1week. At week 5 of corticosteroid therapy, another relapse occurred (7 to 8 stools daily, anemia 6g/dL, ESR 40mm, albumin 17g/L) and we had considered that it was a refractory severe UC. As the patient was reticent to surgery, medical treatment with immunomodulators was indicated. Assessement before immunosuppressive therapy was normal. He received blood transfusion, albumin infusion, parenteral nutrition and intravenous corticosteroids (with progressive decreasing doses). After improvement in health status, anemia (9g/dL) and albumin concentration (37g/L), azathioprine (2,5mg/kg/day, total of 3 months of treatment) and IFX (induction regimen with 5mg/kg, weeks 0, 2 and 6) were prescribed with unchanged disease activity. Drug failure led to a surgical treatment. A subtotal colectomy with double stomy of the ileum and of the sigmoid colon was performed. Colon macroscopic examination revealed multiple polypoid red lesions associated with a large ulcerations. Histologic examination of polypoid lesions showed a fusocellular spindle cells proliferation with a slit like vascular channels and extravased red blood cells consistent with the diagnosis of KS, associated with a typical features of UC (figure 1). Immunolabelling for HHV8 stained the nuclei of the spindle cells (figure 2,3). Involvement in 1 of the 25 perivisceral lymph nodes isolated was demonstrated. The patient underwent mucosal proctectomy and ileoanal anastomosis."
