  "text": "A 68-year-old male patient with a history of Behcet's disease and Sjogren's syndrome was diagnosed with RBD by clinical examination and video-PSG, and he also underwent a multiple sleep latency test and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. The patient had a history of Behcet's disease for 20 years and Sjogren's syndrome for 2Â years. The cerebral magnetic resonance imaging also suggested cerebral demyelination and mild cortical atrophy, with cognitive dysfunction by a score of 28 on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and a score of 22 on the Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA)."
