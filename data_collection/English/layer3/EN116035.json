  "text": "A 57-year adult male with a history of bilateral total hip arthroplasty presented to our institution with bilateral hip pain worst on the right. Range of motion was limited by pain on the right hip at the extremes of motion. Radiographs revealed severe osteolysis, heterotopic ossification, complete wear of the acetabular liner, bony impingement of the femoral greater trochanter on the acetabular rim and superior migration of the femoral head. All findings were confirmed intraoperatively. Revision of the acetabular components was performed, which successfully alleviated the patient's symptoms."
