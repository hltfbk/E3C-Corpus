  "text": "We describe three patients with symptomatic extracranial carotid artery aneurysms; one of them was treated with end-to-end anastomosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery (EICA) after the resection of the aneurysm, while the other two patients were deployed with Willis covered stents in the extracranial internal carotid artery. All of the patients were in good condition when discharged home. After a mean follow-up period of 8Â months, all the patients were alive and only one of them had the neurologic deficit. Additionally, we reviewed the relative literatures."
