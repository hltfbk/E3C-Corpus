  "text": "A 24 years old boy presented to our eye clinic with a complaint of itching and tearing of both eyes of one month duration. This was his first time to visit the eye clinic. There was no eye discharge. There is neither family history of blindness nor associated systemic disease.He had occasional photophobia without any reduction of vision.\nOn physical examination, the visual acuity in both eyes was 6/6 with cup to disc ratio of 0.3 on both sides. The intraocular pressure in the right was 14MM HG and left was 12 MMHGThe examination of iris showed glassy, smooth iris surface with proliferation of iris pigment epithelium on to anterior surface of the iris in both eyes.The pupillary examination showed round appearance, reactive to light but irregular in shape due to abnormal iris pigment epithelium. Visual Field Humphrey is normal. Goniscopy showed open angle and there is no anterior iris insertion in both eyes. Motility of the eyes is normal in all directions and there is no sign of ptosis in both eyes."
