  "text": "A 77-year-old man came to the emergency department with complaints of a 1-day history of abdominal pain and abdominal distension. Abdominal computed tomography revealed ileus and focal free air. Laparotomy revealed multiple small bowel tiny perforations in the ileum. The serosa surface in the whole small bowel had small multiple yellowish tiny discolored lesions. Despite the presence of multiple mucosal ulcers in entire small bowel, the ileum including perforation site was resected segmentally. Microscopically, mucosal ulcers in resected small bowel demonstrated transmural inflammation, no granuloma, and no lymphoid aggregates. These features were consistent with a diagnosis of ICUE with panenteritis and perforation. After surgery, the patient's general condition gradually aggravated. Unfortunately, the patient died of multiple organ failure on post-operative day 14."
