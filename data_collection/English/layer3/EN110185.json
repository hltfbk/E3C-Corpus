  "text": "A 32 years old female, with none known familial past medical history at this time, but a history of cholecystectomy 13 years ago, was initially addressed to hematology by the chest department for anemia. A few months after the first visit, she was admitted to hospital in an emergency setting for dyspnea and chest pain. Examination revealed acute respiratory distress syndrome, chest pain and jaundice associated with a fever of 38.5 ° C. The initial assessment found anemia of 6.9 g / dL, 105 fl VGM, leukocytes to 25.590 Giga/L with 18.510 Giga/L Neutrophils, 4.360 Giga/L Lymphocytis, 2.630 Giga/L Monocytis, 0.9 Giga/L Basophile and 240 Giga/L Platelets. The coagulation tests were normal, the total bilirubin 95mg/L (Normal range: 1-12 mg/L) unconjugated bilirubin 83mg/L, conjugated bilirubin 12 mg/L (< 3mg/L), ALT 13 UI/L, AST 29 UI/L and CRP 204mg/L. The direct Coombs test was positive for Immunoglobulin G, viral serology tests were negative (HBs Antigen, Anti HCV and HIV). The radiological assessment revealed in the chest x-ray a right basal opacity, echocardiography found a minimal cardiac effusion with an ejection fraction at 58% and pulmonary arterial pressure at 31mmHg, normal abdominal ultrasound, venous Doppler of lower limbs was normal, the chest CT angio-scan did not find a pulmonary embolism but bilateral alveolar consolidation predominant on the right associated with minimal pericardial thickening and pleural effusion. The bone marrow biopsy was normal. The patient started steroid treatment but had stopped it by invoking bone pain. The biological exams were completed by immunologics tests: Antinuclear Antibody (normal), anti DNA native antibody (normal), T3 free hormone 0.7ng/ml (0.69-2.02ng/ml / T4 free hormone 4.9µg/dl (4.8-11.6µg/dl) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 27.6 mUI/L (4.5 X Normal range: 0.3-6.2 mUI/L) Antibody Anti-Thyroperoxydase 151.1 UI/ml (4.5 x Normal range 0-34 UI / ml). The hemoglobin electrophoresis found a homozygous sickle cell disease (HbS: 78.5%, and 18.1% HbF, HbA2 3.4%). These results led us to further questioning of the patient in search of a family history of sickle cell disease and painful episodes in childhood or adolescence. The patient did not report any painful episodes in childhood but had a maternal aunt followed in hematology for sickle cell disease. The hemoglobin electrophoresis realised for her mother concluded a heterozygous sickle cell anemia (HbS 35, 2%, HbA 60.8%, HbA2 3%, HbF 1%)."
