  "text": "We present a 28-year-old man with hidradenitis suppurativa stage I in the right axillary region and also in the pubic area. The patient is an active smoker. The patient was treated with Rifampicin 2x 300mg / day without any particular effect and preoperatively, systemic therapy with Clindamycin 4x 600mg / day was performed, combined with daily dressings with jodasept ointment for 7 days. The patient was treated through two surgical sessions under local anaesthesia with elliptical excision of the lesions located in the right axillary and the pubic area. Both of the two surgical defects were initially closed with single interrupted sutures. Histological examination of both lesions revealed the presence of suppurative folliculitis."
