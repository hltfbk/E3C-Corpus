  "text": "A 35 years old female Nigerian patient was diagnosed to have Sickle cell disease since early child hood. She presented to our ophthalmology clinic, in Gaborone, Botswana, with reduction of vision in the left eye for two weeks. During initial evaluation, the visual acuity in right eye was 6/6 and in the left eye counting fingers from a distance of 5 meters. Intraocular pressure in both eyes was with in normal range. Posterior segment evaluation using direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy showed retinal detachment and vitreous haemorrhage in the left eye. B scan ultrasound showed vitreous opacity with retinal detachment in the left eye. The patient was followed in our clinic for more than 3 months with no improvement in her vision on the affected side. Decision was made to perform parsplana vitrectomy. However, the patient refused the surgery despite repeated counselling. Currently her vision on left eye is only light perception."
