  "text": "A 40-year-old man was diagnosed with myxoid liposarcoma of the right thigh and treated with wide resection. Two years after the surgery, a low-density area in the left ventricle was found on follow-up chest computed tomography, and was suspected of being metastatic disease. He underwent surgical treatment, and the lesion was pathologically confirmed as metastasis of myxoid liposarcoma. Fifteen months later, he complained of slight dyspnea and developed metastatic disease in the right atrium. He was treated with surgical excision, followed by radiotherapy. Although there was no recurrence in the heart since the second cardiac metastasectomy, multiple metastases occurred in the abdominal cavity, lungs, and muscles. He finally died of the disease 2â€‰years after the second cardiac metastasectomy."
