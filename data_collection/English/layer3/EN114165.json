  "text": "We report a Thai OI patient who had his first fracture at the age of three months. Using next generation sequencing, we successfully identified two novel compound heterozygous BMP1 mutations. One mutation, c.796_797delTT (p.Phe266Argfs*25) affects both BMP1 and mTLD isoforms, while the other, c.2108-2A > G, affects only the BMP1 isoform. Preservation of the mTLD may explain the relatively less severe clinical phenotype in this patient. Intravenous bisphosphonate was given from the age of 8 months to 5 years. He was free from fractures for 9 months before discontinuation."
