  "text": "A 70 year-old female patient presented for evaluation of severe lifestyle-limiting left-sided claudication refractory to maximal medical therapy. Angiography revealed a chronic total occlusion of the left external iliac artery, which was treated successfully by percutaneous intervention via a primary transpedal approach and with the assistance of the Outback® Elite re-entry device. The patient was discharged 2 h after the procedure and reported significant symptom improvement at follow-up."
