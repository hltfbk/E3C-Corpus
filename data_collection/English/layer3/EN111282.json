  "text": "A 5-year-old girl presented to the outpatient department of our tertiary care hospital with complaints of foul smelling, non-blood stained right ear discharge of one-month duration and deviation of angle of mouth to the left side of acute onset. Investigations revealed a diagnosis of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Multimodal therapy was carried out, and the child was rendered disease-free after two years."
