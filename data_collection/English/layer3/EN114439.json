  "text": "A 65-year-old male met with a high velocity road traffic accident. Plain radiographs showed displaced mid third clavicle fracture with acromioclavicular joint dislocation with mid shaft humerus fracture. Surgical fixation was planned for humerus with interlocking nail, clavicle with locking plate and acromioclavicular joint with reconstruction of coracoclavicular ligaments. Intraoperatively, coracoid process was found to have a comminuted fracture. The operative plan had to be changed on table as coracoclavicular fixation was not possible. So acromioclavicular joint fixation was done using tension band wiring and the coracoclavicular ligament was repaired using a 2-0 ethibond. The comminuted coracoid fracture was managed conservatively. K wires were removed at 6 weeks. Early mobilization was started."
