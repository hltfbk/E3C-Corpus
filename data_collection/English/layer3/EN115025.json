  "text": "A 64 year old South Asian (Sri Lankan) male with a history of chronic obstructive airway disease presented to us with fever and cough. He had a generalized smooth and shiny skin with ulcerating skin lesions afflicting the digits of the fingers. The lesions progressed to involve the extremities of the body and healed with crusting. Based on the clinical and investigational findings Tuberculosis and common vasculitic conditions were suspected and excluded. The unusual skin manifestations prompted a biopsy, and wade fite stained revealed Mycobacterium bacilli. In context of the clinical picture and histological findings, Lucio's phenomenon was suspected. A clinical diagnosis of Lucio's phenomenon occurring in the backdrop of lepromatous leprosy was made."
