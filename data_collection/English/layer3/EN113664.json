  "text": "Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and muation screening of NDE1 gene were performed in an 8-month patient with severe congenital microcephaly, and/or his parents. Genetic studies found a 16p13.11 deletion containing NDE1 gene, and a novel NDE1 mutation c.555_556GC > CT on the non-deleted homolog, inherited from his phenotypically normal parents, respectively. The 2 bp nucleotide change results in a missense mutation p.K185 N and a nonsense mutation p.Q186X. We also conducted literaturte review to compare the clinical phenotypes of our patient to those of cases previously reported with NDE1 mutations, and found all patients had mental retardation, severe microcephaly, and corpus callosum agenesis."
