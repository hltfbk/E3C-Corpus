  "text": "A 43-year-old woman was admitted due to a rapidly progressive tumor on her head. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as sebaceous carcinoma. We diagnosed her with Muir-Torre syndrome based on the following evidence: 1) high prevalence of microsatellite instability in gene locus assay, 2) absence of mismatch repair proteins in the sebaceous carcinoma on immunohistochemical analysis, and 3) a genetic mutation of 1226_1227delAG in the MSH2 exon 7 in the lesion detected by DNA sequencing analysis. Several reports have shown an association between immunosuppressive agents and latent Muir-Torre syndrome progression. Therefore, the progression of colon cancer in this case originated from her genetic mutation for Muir-Torre syndrome and long-term use of immunosuppressive agents."
