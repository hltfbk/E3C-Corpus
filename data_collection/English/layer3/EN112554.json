  "text": "We present a case of a 44-year-old Caucasian man who was admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and respiratory failure and who required invasive mechanical ventilation. During admission, the patient developed sudden, severe hypotension that was refractory to treatment. An adequate diagnosis with transthoracic echocardiography was unachievable because of a poor echocardiographic window. However, the combined use of electrocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography established pulmonary embolism as a high-probability diagnosis based on findings of right ventricular pressure overload and right ventricular dysfunction. The unfavorable hemodynamic situation of the patient prevented his transfer to carry out other complementary tests that could confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Fibrinolytic and anticoagulant therapies were administered immediately, and a favorable clinical outcome was achieved."
