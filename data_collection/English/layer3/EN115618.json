  "text": "A 3-year-old Taiwanese boy with Kabuki syndrome had a short stature, spinal dysraphism, intellectual disability and typical facial features. Ophthalmic findings which have been previously reported in the literature and in this patient, included ptosis, esotropia, coloboma of the iris, retina, choroid and optic disc, and microcornea. The newly identified ophthalmic features in this patient included colobomatous microphthalmos and a dysplastic and elevated disc without central cupping. The genetic analysis identified an MLL2 gene mutation."
