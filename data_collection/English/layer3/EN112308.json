  "text": "A 46â€‰years young female presented first time to the hospital with uncontrolled seizures and headache in 5 months duration. Seizures were very atypical in semiology with ptosis and mydriasis to either side along with ipsilateral ocular deviation. The episodes were bilateral but right eyelid ptosis, mydriasis and right horizontal conjugate deviation were frequent. MRI brain showed encephalomalacia in the left frontal region on axial T2 and coronal T1 weighted images without any enhancement on gadolinium contrast. CECT abdomen revealed a heterogeneously enhancing gall bladder mass with the evidence of lung metastasis from chest CT scan. CSF for malignant cytology was negative. Seizures were refractory to the treatment."
