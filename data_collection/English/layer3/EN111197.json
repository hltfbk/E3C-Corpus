  "text": "A 45-year-old man was referred to our center for a palpable thyroid nodule. Ultrasound-guided FNA was carried out for the patient. Cytology slides showed many isolated and small clusters of round to oval cells, some with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and red cytoplasmic granules. Rare cells showed multiple red Auer rods. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of MTC."
