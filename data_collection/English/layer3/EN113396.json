  "text": "We hereby report a case of combined afibrinogenemia and congenital antithrombin deficiency manifested by recurrent life-threatening bleeding, as well as spontaneous severe arterial occlusion, such as acute coronary syndrome and stroke, and venous thromboses like pulmonary embolism.Secondary fibrinogen prophylaxis is recommended following any initial life-threatening bleeding episode in patients with afibrinogenemia, yet the high associated risk of thrombosis illustrates the complexity of choosing the most effective prophylaxis strategy combining fibrinogen concentrate with antithrombotic agent for optimal protection against the risk of both severe bleeding and thrombosis. For our patient, the thrombin generation assay objectively confirmed her prothrombotic tendency."
