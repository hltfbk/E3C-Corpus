  "text": "We present two cases of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis treated with Low Contact Stress patellofemoral arthroplasty; in both cases the polyethylene mobile-bearing of the patellar component dissociated from the metal backing. One patient had a revision to a Richards patellofemoral prosthesis, and in the second patient the arthroplasty was converted to a total knee prosthesis because of clinically important femorotibial osteoarthritis."
