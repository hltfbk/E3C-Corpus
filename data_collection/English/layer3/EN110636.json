  "text": "A 55-year-old man was admitted to the neurosurgery department for repeated dizziness for over a year and sudden onset of syncope 1â€‰month prior, and he was diagnosed with carotid occlusive disease. After surgical contraindications were excluded, dual bypass and encephalo-duro-myo-synangiosis were performed. Although blood pressure and fluid management were strictly under control promptly after surgery, massive cerebral edema involving the left anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery territories occurred from the 6th day after surgery. Additionally, no discernible cerebral infarction or hemorrhage occurred. Moreover, the cerebral blood flow of the middle cerebral artery displayed an early decrease followed by delayed elevation on the left side. Without restricting the spreading of cerebral edema, life-threatening cerebral herniation could develop at any time. Mannitol and furosemide were administered for impending cerebral herniation. The amelioration of symptoms was noticed on the 16th day after surgery. The patient felt relief on the 21st day after surgery. Digital subtraction angiography performed on the 180th day after surgery demonstrated the patency of dual anastomosed vessels, and the patient recovered without any permanent neurological deficit."
