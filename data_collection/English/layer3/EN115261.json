  "text": "A 77 year-old woman with a black spot with slow progressive growth on the left plantar region. She sought medical attention due to the expansion onto the dorsal surface of toes. The lesion had irregular borders and had spread to half the plantar surface. Histopathology confirmed the clinical suspicion of acral lentiginous melanoma Clark level IV and 2.6 mm Breslow thickness. The surgical specimen was entirely processed for histological evaluation, requiring 53 slides. Tumor dermal invasion was detected in only three out of 53 glass slides as the invasiveness was not identified by clinical, dermatoscopy or macroscopy exams."
