  "text": "We report the case of a 55 year old lady, who had longstanding history of depression and acid peptic disease. Serum calcium eight months prior to presentation was slightly high, but she was never worked up. She was found to be Vitamin D deficient while being investigated for generalized body aches. A month after she was replaced with Vitamin D, she presented to us with parathyroid crisis. Her corrected serum calcium was 23.0 mg/dL. She had severe gastrointestinal symptoms and acute kidney injury. She had unexplained consistent hypokalemia until surgery. Neck ultrasound and CT scan revealed giant parathyroid cyst extending into the mediastinum. After initial medical management for parathyroid crisis, parathyroid cystic adenoma was surgically excised. Her serum calcium, intact parathyroid hormone, creatinine and potassium levels normalized after surgery."
