  "text": "A 79-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department of our hospital complaining of abdominal pain. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed cholecystolithiasis, intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, gas accumulation, small intestinal obstruction, and circular high-density shadow in the intestinal cavity. Emergency surgery revealed that the small intestine had extensive adhesions, unclear gallbladder exposure, obvious adhesions, and difficult separation. The obstruction was located 70 cm between the ileum and the ileocecum, which was incarcerated by gallstones, and a simple enterolithotomy was carried out. On the third day after the operation, he had passed gas and defecated and had begun a liquid diet. On the fifth day after the operation, he suddenly experienced abdominal distension and discomfort. Emergency CT examination revealed recurrent GSI, and the diameter of the stone was approximately 2.0 cm (consistent with the shape of cholecystolithiasis on the abdominal CT scan before the first operation). The patient's symptoms were not significantly relieved after conservative treatment. On the ninth day after the operation, emergency enterolithotomy was performed again along the original surgical incision. On the twentieth day after the second operation, the patient fully recovered and was discharged from the hospital."
