  "text": "This is a retrospective series of five cases managed between January 2014 and December 2016. All were men with a mean age of 30.6 years with a mean follow-up of 27 months. We analyzed their demographic, clinical data, history, wound locations, primary diagnosis on histopathology, organisms isolated on culture, surgical details, antibiotics administered, and special interventions such as skin flaps or grafting and clinical outcome.Of the five, three patients received exclusive external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and two were given intralesional brachytherapy and EBRT. Three received additional chemotherapy. 7/9 isolated organisms were multidrug-resistant mean 5.4 cycles of NPWT after aggressive debridement was needed to achieve healthy granulation tissue bed. Wounds were closed at median 31.5 days (three split-thickness split skin grafting, one local rotation flap, and one healing with secondary intention). We had two mortalities secondary to metastasis."
