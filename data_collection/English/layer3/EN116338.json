  "text": "We present a case of a 21 year old male who presented with a swelling of the right inguinal region which was gradually progressive. Radiologically, there was a lytic expansile lesion of the superior pubic ramus. A contrast computed tomography revealed multiloculated cystic cavities and histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of ABC. Surgical excision of the complete tumor by anterior approach was done. Till date (2 years since surgery) patient has no recurrence."
