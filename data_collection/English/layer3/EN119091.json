  "text": "An asymptomatic 58-year-old male with a giant left atrial tumor, was transferred to our Unit for surgical treatment. The tumor was an incidental finding during a work-up for hemoptysis due to bronchectasis. The coronary angiogram showed tumor vessels originating from the RCA. The tumor macroscopically did not resemble a myxoma, considering its dimensions (12 x 10 cm) and its solid substance. The mass was excised together with the interatrial septum and the right lateral LA wall close to the right pulmonary veins orifices. The defect was closed with Dacron patches in order to prevent malformation of both atria. The pathology study revealed a benign myxoma with excessive osteoid (mature bone) content."
