  "text": "Three Korean infants presented with bilateral dense stromal opacification which had been present since birth. IOPs measured by rebound tonometer were high despite administration of multiple anti-glaucoma medications. One eye of each patient underwent penetrating keratoplasty (PK) because corneal opacity impaired visual development. Immediately after PK, IOPs were normalized and maintained normal without medication, whereas they remained high in the contralateral unoperated eye. On histology, stromal fibrosis was observed in the removed corneal button, and molecular assays revealed increased levels of type 1 and 5 collagens."
