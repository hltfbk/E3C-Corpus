  "text": "The 59-year-old patient presented with a mass in the left supraclavicular fossa and numbness in the arm, six years following radical irradiation of the head and neck for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Open biopsy showed pleomorphic spindle cell sarcoma. She was treated with pre-operative hyperfractionated radiotherapy followed by margin-negative wide excision and nerve grafting. Cumulative radiation dose to the supraclavicular fossa was 98 Gy. Histological examination of the post-irradiation tumor specimens showed evidence of significant tumor response to re-irradiation. The patient remained free of disease five years after surgery with excellent functional outcome."
