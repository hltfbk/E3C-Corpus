  "text": "We present the case of a 21-year-old female patient who was admitted to our emergency service with symptoms of ileus as a result of intussusception due to duodenal polyps. Radiological and endoscopic findings determined a jejunoduedonal intussusception. After an unsuccessful endoscopic attempt, a laparotomy was performed that revealed a polypoid mass originating from the fourth part of her duodenum, with intussusception of her proximal jejunum."
