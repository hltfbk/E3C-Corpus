  "text": "We report the case of a patient with HCC and a large TT (85 × 45 mm) extending into the RA through the hepatic vein and IVC, which is very rare. We performed percutaneous microwave ablation of the TT and the two intrahepatic tumors (maximum diameter, 57 mm). The treatment shrank the tumors, and the patient is in good condition and has survived for 16 months thus far. A literature review was also performed. This is the first such case to be treated with percutaneous microwave ablation."
