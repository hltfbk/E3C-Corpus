  "text": "A 59-year-old Caucasian man with septic shock secondary to community-acquired pneumonia treated with DrotAA, subsequently developed an ST-elevation myocardial infarction 12 hours after starting DrotAA. DrotAA was stopped and the patient was given tenecteplase thrombolysis resulting in complete resolution of ST-elevation and no adverse bleeding events. DrotAA was restarted to complete the 96-hour course. The sepsis resolved and the patient was discharged from hospital."
