  "text": "We report a case of MPAL with CD19 expression. The patient was treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia-like induction and consolidation therapies but remained positive for SET-NUP214 fusion gene transcript. He subsequently underwent a haploidentical stem cell transplantation but relapsed within 6 months. He then underwent donor-derived CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapy and achieved a sustained, complete molecular remission. Unfortunately, he developed a CD19-positive relapse after 2 years. Donor-derived humanized CD19-directed CAR-T cells induced a second complete molecular remission without severe cytokine release syndrome or acute graft-versus-host disease."
