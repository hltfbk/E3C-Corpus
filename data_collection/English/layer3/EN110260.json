  "text": "A 38 -year-old female patient consulted at our department. She has no family or individual medical history. She has presented 3 years earlier, a progressive increase in thigh volume with functional disability. On the physical examination we have found a painless mass of the right thigh with hard consistency and neovascularization. Results of laboratory studies were normal: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) C-reactive protein (CRP) and calcium and phosphate levels. The radiography of the right thigh showed a large calcifications or ectopic bone of soft tissues. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thigh has shown a significant increase of the right thigh muscles witha high signal intensity on T2- weighted images related tocalcification area. A muscle biopsy was done with immunohistological study and the result was in favor of myositis ossificans. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's legal guardian for publication of the case."
