  "text": "A 58-year-old female sustained bilateral PHF due to electrocution and was treated with bilateral ORIF in single stage in February 2018.At 4 months from the time of surgery, the fracture on the left side had united, but there was non-union on the right side with screw penetration eroding the glenoid. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty was planned as a salvage procedure. Intraoperative, the glenoid was found to be small (2.7cm × 1.72cm) and there was a posterior glenoid defect due to screw penetration. During drilling for central peg, an iatrogenic glenoid fracture occurred. The procedure was deferred. After 4 months of conservative treatment, the glenoid fracture had united and then a definitive procedure with the reverse shoulder prosthesis was planned. 3D glenoid bone model was made based on the computed tomography scan and custom-made jigs are designed and 3D printed, which are specific for the patient. Reverse shoulder arthroplasty was done, and surgery went uneventful. The patient achieved active forward elevation of 110°, lateral elevation of 90°, and an external rotation of 10° at 1-year follow-up."
