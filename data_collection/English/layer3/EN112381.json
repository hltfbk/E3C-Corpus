  "text": "A 73-year-old woman was followed up for giant hepatic cyst occupying the right lobe of the liver. During the follow-up, an enhancing mural nodule was newly noted on computed tomography in 2016. Based on additional clinical examinations, biliary cystadenocarcinoma was undeniable, and laparoscopy-assisted extended right hepatectomy was performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. She had no perioperative complications and was discharged on postoperative day 13. A histological examination of the mural nodule showed neovascularization within an organized hematoma."
