  "text": "We report a case of a 58-year-old lady with a recurrence of non-Hodgkin MALT B-cell lymphoma, presenting with acute kidney injury, nephrotic range proteinuria and a cellular urinalysis. She underwent a renal biopsy that showed a severe diffuse proliferative and exudative lupus-like glomerulonephritis, which is likely paraneoplastic in nature. We discuss the differential diagnosis and possible pathogenesis of glomerular injury in lymphoma-related proliferative glomerulonephritis."
