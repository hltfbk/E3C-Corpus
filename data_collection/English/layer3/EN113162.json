  "text": "We detected a novel homozygous TP53RK mutation (NM_033550, c.194A > T, p.Lys65Met) using whole exome sequencing in a familial case of GAMOS with three affected siblings. All three patients manifested similar phenotypes, including very early-onset nephrotic syndrome (8 days, 1 day, and 1 day after birth, respectively), microcephaly, dysmorphic faces, and early fatality (10 months, 21 days, and 25 days of age, respectively). One patient also showed hiatal hernia with gastric volvulus. Renal biopsy performed on one patient revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with severe tubulo-interstitial changes."
