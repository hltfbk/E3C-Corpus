  "text": "We describe a novel case of osteochondroma arising on the ventral aspect of right scapula in a 16-year-old otherwise healthy female patient causing snapping and pseudowinging of scapula and occasional pain in affected area. X-ray and computed tomography findings were consistent with an abnormal bony mass arising on ventral aspect of superior border of the scapula. The patient was treated with open extraperiosteal resection of the mass with relief of symptoms. The histopathological diagnosis was consistent with osteochondroma with no signs of malignancy."
