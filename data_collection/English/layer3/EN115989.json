  "text": "A 77-year-old woman was found to have a solitary pulmonary lesion 6 years after the initial treatment of sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid. Video-assisted lung wedge resection of an undetermined pulmonary nodule was carried out successfully. Microscopically, the tumor showed foamy cytoplasm and atypical nuclei, consistent with metastasis of eyelid sebaceous carcinoma."
