  "text": "We devised a simpler strategy of complete intraoperative deformity correction in one or two stages followed by compression osteosynthesis. We report the good outcome in four patients (3 males, and 1 female, age 4--years) with regard to union, alignment, limb length, and function, with significantly short duration of the \"dynamic\" phase of Ilizarov osteosynthesis."
