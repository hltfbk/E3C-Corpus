  "text": "A 42-year-old Japanese woman with right Pryce III intralobar sequestration was admitted to our hospital. We planned video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection of the right sequestration using near-infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green because of the small volume of the nonfunctional region. The aberrant artery was recognized in the pulmonary ligament; the artery was cut off after ligation. Indocyanine green at 5â€‰mg/body was rapidly injected into the peripheral vein, and the boundary of the sequestration was clearly identified under near-infrared fluorescence imaging."
