  "text": "A 17-year-old male patient sustained a road traffic accident (truck and bicycle collision) on the 16 th of March 2020. He presented with blunt abdominal trauma, a crush, and degloving injury to the left buttock, thigh, and perineal regions. We performed a diverting colostomy to prevent faeces contamination of the wound. Necrotic tissues, including skin and muscles as the Gluteus Maximus, the Gluteus Medius, the Tensor Fascia Lata, some muscles of the posterior compartment of the left thigh, and part of the Vastus Lateralis were all excised. Due to the extent of the defect associated with the sacral bone and coccyx exposition, a free latissimus dorsi (LD) and an anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap were indicated. Unfortunately, before we reached a local acceptable inflammation state for the reconstruction, we got into a state of emergency in which the government gave stay-at-home instruction. The medical staff was instructed to use medical resources efficiently. The anaesthesia team was busy dealing or planning critical care for COVID-19 patients. There was a limited room left for surgery of the magnitude of a double-free flap in our centre at this time. We decided to manage the patient according to our previous experience in using negative pressure wound therapy [6]. Multiple surgical debridements were necessary to remove all the necrotic tissues. Then, the wound was covered with gauze, sealed with transparent dressings, and connected to a wall suction under a pressure of 200 mmHg. We could manage to get a seal of around 90% using the tips described by Amouzou et al. [7]. The dressing was changed every three days under sedation. A granulation tissue appeared within 17 consecutive days of this therapy. The patient presented local colonization of the wound by an Imipenem resistant Pseudomonas spp. Acinetobacter baumanii sensitive only to the quinolone family; a split-thickness skin graft was performed to resurface all the raw areas in a one-stage surgery. On top of the graft, we applied the domestic NPWT again; however, with a lower suction pressure (150mmHg). An intravenous (IV) colicine and ciprofloxacin were given to the patient as an adjunct to the coverage surgery. The graft take was 95%. The patient was discharged on the 25 th of April 2020 (day 39). He was reviewed in the outpatient department every 4 to 5 days for wound care and physiotherapy. He was ambulating with a double walking cane. We acknowledged to him that some other procedures might be needed when the COVID-19's crisis will be over should bulkier coverage still be required. The patient and his mother gave their consent to use the medical records for a scientific publication."
