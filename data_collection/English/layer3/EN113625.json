  "text": "We report a case of a 50-year-old female with bilateral foot deformities as a manifestation of the rare genetic disorder HCS. Surgical management of the left foot consisted of Morton's neuroma excision and Weil osteotomy with proximal interphalangeal joint resection and Kirschner wire fixation of the second and third metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints. Recurrent subluxation of the left second MTP joint was observed at 5-week follow-up. The right foot was treated similarly 7weeks after the initial operation. The post-operative course of the right foot was complicated by bone resorption and nonunion of the second and third metatarsal Weil osteotomies."
