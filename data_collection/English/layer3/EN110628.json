  "text": "We report a 37-year-old male patient with pelvic lipomatosis who received a successful living donor renal transplantation on July 22, 2015. The operation was complicated as the iliac vessels and bladder were wrapped entirely in excessive abnormal fat. The external iliac artery and vein were located using ultrasonographic guidance. The adipose tissue around the right bladder was removed as far as possible, and the graft ureter was reimplanted into the bladder, using the Lich-Gregoir technique. At 22 mo after transplantation, graft percutaneous nephrostomy was performed under ultrasonographic guidance for urinary diversion due to hydronephrosis of the graft kidney. Follow-up at four years showed that the renal allograft function was stable."
