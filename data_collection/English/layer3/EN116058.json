  "text": "During a coronary angiography of a 43-year-old man, we encountered a very rare bilateral congenital absence of the radial artery. For both arms, the radial arteries were not observed and the ulnar arteries were small in size, while anterior interosseous arteries were found to be the dominant artery. Coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention were performed via the brachial artery since transradial percutaneous coronary intervention failed."
