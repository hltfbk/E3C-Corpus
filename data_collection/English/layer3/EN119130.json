  "text": "We report a patient who developed ARF and Fanconi syndrome during treatment with tenofovir. Despite severe metabolic acidosis associated with a creatinine of 9.8 mg/dL (866 mumol/L), this patient's condition improved on discontinuation of tenofovir treatment without requiring renal replacement therapy."
