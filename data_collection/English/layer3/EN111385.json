  "text": "In the present case, a 73-year-old man referred to the hospital with symptoms including dyspnea, cold sweating, and chest pain with a burning nature which was lasting for 30 minutes. Angiography revealed coronary artery obstruction, so he became a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) candidate. Except for dilatation of the left atrium, no specific findings were reported in the patient's echocardiography report. When the pump was turned off by the surgeon, the patient's heart filled up and he was not able to get off the pump. Simultaneously, the patient started to have bloody respiratory secretions. With all that in mind, the surgeon suspected that he might suffer from a PDA, then he found an 8-mm PDA and closed it. Then, the patient was taken off the cardiorespiratory pump."
