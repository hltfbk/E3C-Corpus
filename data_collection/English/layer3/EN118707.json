  "text": "A 60-year-old Indian man presented with diffuse swelling and pain in the left shoulder for the previous 6 months. A computed tomography scan of the left shoulder revealed crescentic lucency in the humeral head, suggestive of osteonecrosis. Fine needle aspiration cytology smears from the swelling showed features of an acute suppurative lesion. Stain for acid-fast bacillus was positive and thus, a final clinico-pathological diagnosis of osteonecrosis of humeral head with tubercular etiology was rendered. The patient was initiated on anti-tuberculous therapy with symptomatic improvement in his condition."
