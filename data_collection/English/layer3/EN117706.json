  "text": "A 56-year-old man with carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater presented with spontaneous gallbladder perforation and localized bile peritonitis. He complained of right upper abdominal pain, and laparotomy revealed perforation of the gallbladder with no gallstones. Postoperative upper gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrated a slightly enlarged duodenal papilla, and biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma of the ampulla. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed subsequently."
