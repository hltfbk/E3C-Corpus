  "text": "A 46-year-old man lost the ability to hold his trunk upright, and had difficulty in raising his head, but he had no obvious symptoms of limb weakness. Meanwhile, he developed persistent numbness of limbs and lips around. Myopathological features and combined elevation of multiple acylcarnitines indicated that the axial myopathy might be caused by lipid storage myopathy. Cervical and lumbosacral MRI revealed a lot of abnormal signals diffusing along paravertebral muscles, while the abnormal signals almost disappeared after riboflavin treatment. Nerve conduction study indicated the patient suffering from predominantly sensory neuropathy and mildly motor neuropathy. Muscle pathology also demonstrated no typical neurogenic change, which was consistent with the electrophysiological findings. Causative mutations were found in the ETFDH gene."
