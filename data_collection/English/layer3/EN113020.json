  "text": "A 67-year-old lady underwent routine left cataract surgery in a separate unit but subsequently attended our eye casualty with recurrent hypertensive anterior uveitis. She was found to have secondary pigment dispersion glaucoma as the intraocular lens had been inadvertently placed into the ciliary sulcus. She underwent a trabeculectomy to control the intraocular pressure and initially settled well but 12Â months later developed persistent anterior segment inflammation and macular oedema. She subsequently had the intraocular lens removed and the macular oedema was treated successfully with intravitreal Bevacizumab."
