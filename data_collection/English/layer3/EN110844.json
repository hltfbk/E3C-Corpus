  "text": "We report a case of strongyloidiasis infection syndrome that was difficult to differentiate from immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) for various reasons. The patient had been treated with the corticosteroids tacrolimus (Tac) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with lupus nephritis and pancytopenia. When the steroid was reduced, she developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) enteritis, and her respiratory status rapidly deteriorated immediately after the withdrawal of Tac and MMF. It was difficult to distinguish immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome from strongyloidiasis infection syndrome because stool cultures were negative and eosinophils were not increased. Bronchoscopy revealed viable Strongyloides, leading to a diagnosis of strongyloidiasis infection syndrome, but the patient died despite treatment."
