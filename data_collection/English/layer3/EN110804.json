  "text": "A 68-year-old woman attended the Tianjin Taida Hospital surgical Clinic mainly because of \"intermittent cough for >1 month\". Chest computed tomography (CT) showed multiple solid nodules in the upper and lower left lung. The nodules had irregular outlines, with a maximum diameter of 65â€‰mm. A double needle lung biopsy specimen was removed guided by ultrasound under local anesthesia. Histologically, the biopsy specimen was finally diagnosed as the distal type of BA."
