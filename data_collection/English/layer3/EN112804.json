  "text": "This case report describes a monostotic fibrous dysplasia in which the patient's right midface had a prominent appearance. The asymmetric maxillary area was surgically recontoured via the midfacial degloving approach under general anesthesia. Follow-up photography and radiographic imaging after surgery showed the structures were in a stable state without recurrence of the FD lesion. Furthermore, there were no visible scars or functional disability, and the patient reported no postoperative discomfort."
