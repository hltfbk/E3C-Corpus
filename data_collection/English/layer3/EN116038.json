  "text": "A 40 year old, female with known BSS and developmental dysplasia of her left hip (DDH) was referred to us for consideration of left total hip arthroplasty (THA). Consultation with her Haematologist for pre-operative optimization of platelets and related clotting times together with detailed discussions of her intended anaesthesia protocol and surgery resulted in a successful operation with less than anticipated blood loss. She entered our rehabilitation program just one week after surgery."
