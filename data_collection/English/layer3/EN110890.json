  "text": "A 69-year-old man developed bilateral panuveitis after nivolumab treatment for recurrent hypopharyngeal cancer. Slit lamp examination revealed bilateral granulomatous keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells and partial synechiae. Fundus examination revealed bilateral optic disc edema and diffuse serous retinal detachment. His human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing showed HLA-DRB1*04:05 allele. A lumbar puncture did not demonstrate pleocytosis. Bilateral sub-tenon injections of triamcinolone acetonide were initiated. As his panuveitis did not regress completely, steroid pulse therapy was administered. That therapy led to the resolution of his serous retinal detachment and to rapid improvement in his vision. Following this, we treated him with 50 mg/day of prednisolone for 1 week and then reduced it by 5 mg every week. No bilateral uveitis relapse had occurred by his 3-month follow-up; however, he subsequently died because of his cancer."
