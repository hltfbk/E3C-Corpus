  "text": "A 48-years-old man presented with uremia and anemia. Laboratory examination revealed low levels of serum IgG, IgA, and IgM. Serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis showed a free κ monoclonal band. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed hypercellularity with marked plasmacytosis. Light microscopy revealed eosinophilic cuboid- and rhomboid-shaped crystals in the cytoplasm of proximal tubular epithelial cells, diffuse large mononuclear and multinuclear cells in the interstitium, and obstructed distal tubules with cast and giant cell reaction. Immunohistochemical examination indicated intense staining for κ light chains within casts, histiocytes, and tubular epithelial cells. Electron microscopy revealed electro-dense cuboid-, rhomboid-, or needle-shaped crystalline inclusions in proximal tubular epithelial cells and interstitial histiocytes. According to these results, we confirmed that this patient with myeloma exhibited simultaneous light chain proximal tubulopathy, crystal-storing histiocytosis, and myeloma cast nephropathy, which were attributed to monoclonal κ light chains. In addition to dialysis, the patient received induction chemotherapy with a combination of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone, followed by maintenance therapy with thalidomide. However, the patient did not regain renal function even when less than 5% plasma cells were detected in the bone marrow."
