  "text": "A 42-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department for a right thoracic traumatism after a road traffic accident. The patient presented pain of the right shoulder with an oedema of the subclavicular region. He was hemodynamically stable. The physical examination found an expanding hematoma on the right side of the neck, there was no neurological deficit, ipsilateral radial and brachial pulses of the right upper limb were palpable.\nRadiography of the right shoulder showed a midclavicular fracture. An arterial doppler of vessels showed a circulating hematoma in the contact of the right subclavian artery measuring 4 cm in diameter with a correct distality flow.\nComputed tomographic angiogram (CT) of the chest confirmed the diagnosis of a false aneurysm measuring 4 cm in the postvertebral portion of the right subclavian artery. The hemogram showed a haemoglobin = 13g/dl.\nThe patient was urgently taken to the operating room, a first vascular time was consisted of an excision of the pseudoaneurysm and a repair of the arterial injury by an arterial patch taken from the right arterial trunk thyro-bicervico-scapular which was split, the second time was orthopaedic, the clavicle was fixed with a reconstruction plate and screws.\nThe postoperative course was uneventful, and subsequent follow-up at 6 months revealed a well-perfused right upper limb."
