  "text": "A 49- year- old Saudi man presented with a progressive hearing loss and fullness in the left ear with the history of otitis media for which he had undergone myringotomy and ventilating tubes insertion. Earlier at the age of 45 years this patient was given radiotherapy for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma in his cheek. The otoscopy showed a protruded external ear mass obscuring the tympanic membrane. Microscopy and histological examination suggested an endocrine adenoma of the middle ear. The computerized tomography scan of the temporal bone showed an extensive soft tissue mass without any osteolysis. Histological and immunohistochemical examination following surgical excision confirmed the diagnosis of neuroendocrine adenoma of the middle ear."
