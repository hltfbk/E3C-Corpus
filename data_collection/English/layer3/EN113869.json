  "text": "We report here a case of aseptic loosening of an uncemented total hip arthroplasty acetabulum in an acromegalic patient that was revised with a cemented cup. It has been suggested that the incidence of this complication is increased in other pathology with a similarly high bone-turnover (e.g., Paget's disease), but this complication has however not yet been reported in the setting of acromegaly."
