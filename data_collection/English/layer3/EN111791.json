  "text": "In this paper, we describe a 31-year-old male patient with CFT in the mediastinum. The patient did not have any symptoms, and the posterior mediastinal lesion was unintentionally found during routine re-examination of thyroid cancer. The tumor had no adhesion to the surrounding tissue and was successfully and completely removed. Pathology showed a large amount of collagen-rich fibrous connective tissue. There was scattered dystrophic calcification and gravel in the fibrous tissue and a small amount of lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration and lymphoid follicle formation in the interstitial fluid. In addition, findings showed 20 IgG4+ plasma cells per high-powered field of the diseased tissue, an IgG4+/IgG ratio of about 20%, and normal serum IgG4 levels. The final diagnosis was CFT of the mediastinum (CFTM). No evidence of tumor recurrence was observed by computed tomography at 3 mo after surgery."
