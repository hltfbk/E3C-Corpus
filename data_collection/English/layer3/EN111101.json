  "text": "A 30-year-old man complained of repeated painless gross haematuria for half a month. Conventional ultrasound demonstrated a hypoechoic solitary lesion with hyperechoic margins measuring 3.4 × 3.1 cm in the anterior wall of the bladder. Superb microvascular imaging (SMI) showed a strong flow signal in the mass. CEUS revealed that the lesion was characterized by hyper-enhancement in the early phase and hypo-enhancement in the late phase. The entire bladder wall was disrupted by homogeneous hyper-enhanced tumor tissue on CEUS. Time-intensity curves (TICs) showed a rapid wash-in with a high maximum signal intensity (SI) and quick wash-out. Finally, partial cystectomy was performed and the pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of LCNEC with invasion into the whole layer of the bladder wall."
