  "text": "A 54-year-old apparently healthy male presents for the fourth time with an unprovoked superficial thrombophlebitis of the leg. When screened for underlying causes a renal cell carcinoma and an adenocarcinoma of the prostate are diagnosed. The renal cell carcinoma pointed out to have been visible on a CT-scan, made just before the time of the first presentation of the thrombophlebitis."
