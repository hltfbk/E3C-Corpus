  "text": "A 49-year-old woman diagnosed with HIV Type 1 infection and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count of 482 presented with a four-week history of multiple crusted plaques, nodules, and ulcers on her face, arms, and abdomen. Her past history revealed red painful eyes six months prior to this presentation. She had generalized lymphadenopathy, no alopecia, and no palmar-plantar or mucosal lesions. There were no features suggestive of secondary syphilis. Neurological examination was normal. Her rapid plasma reagin test was positive to a titer of 64. She was treated with Penicillin G 20â€‰mu IVI daily for 2 weeks."
