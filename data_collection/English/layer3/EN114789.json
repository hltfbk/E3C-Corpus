  "text": "The \"extroverted cuff\" technique that we propose is a novel modification of the flanged technique for the elephant trunk construction. The technique consists in the graft extroversion which is than located inside the descending aorta. Then the distal anastomosis is constructed between the descending aorta and the circular free edge the external layer of the graft. Such a technique was successfully applied in a patient with type A aortic dissection undergoing modified elephant trunk technique, aortic arch replacement and Bentall operation."
