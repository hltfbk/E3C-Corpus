  "text": "This case describes a 31-year old woman with RRMS, who experienced severe side effects on natalizumab. After a voluntary fourÂ months treatment free period, a severe relapse appeared which was treated with prednisone and plasmapheresis; thereafter fingolimod was initiated. In the following months MRI signs improved spectacularly."
