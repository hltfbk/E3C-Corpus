  "text": "FOLFOX-6 was administered to a pregnant, 33-year-old Saudi woman with metastatic colon cancer from 22 to 30 weeks of gestation. Her cancer was diagnosed during her pregnancy. She tolerated the chemotherapy well and delivered a full-term baby girl with no obvious harm, and normal development was documented at her 2-year follow-up examination."
