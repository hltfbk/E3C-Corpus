  "text": "We introduce a case of 34 year old twin pregnant woman diagnosed with superimposed preeclampsia on chronic hypertension at 28 + 1/7 weeks of gestation. A level III polysomnography showed obstructive sleep apnoea, and automatic CPAP was applied. After the CPAP treatment concomitant with an antihypertensive drugs, both blood pressure and urinary protein concentration were reduced. The pregnancy safely continued for 49 days (to 35 + 1/7 weeks), with stable blood pressure, allowing prolongation of gestation of the foetuses."
