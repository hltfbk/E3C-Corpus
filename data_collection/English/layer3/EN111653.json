  "text": "The patient was a 34 years old male who presented with a reduced level of consciousness and acute hearing loss after suicidal ingestion of 40 mg of methadone while experiencing family-related stresses. He had no prior history of methadone use, abuse, or addiction. Initial laboratory testing was significant for a serum creatinine concentration of 4.1 mg/dl, a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis, thrombocytopenia, abnormal hepatic transaminases, and coagulation tests. The patient then developed severe rhabdomyolysis. Also, audiometry showed a bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. The patient required hemodialysis for 11 days while his metabolic abnormalities gradually resolved. However, his hearing loss was persistent, as demonstrated by 2 years of follow up."
