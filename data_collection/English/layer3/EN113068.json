The patient has a body mass index of 22.15 and was undergoing a right THA with a posterior approach. He was placed in the lateral decubitus position with an axillary roll in place for approximately 2 h and 45 min. Occupational therapy, orthopedics, and electromyography were used to evaluate the patient in the post-operative time for his radial nerve palsy."
