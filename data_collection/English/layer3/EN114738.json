  "text": "We describe the co-inheritance of a novel heterozygous missense mutation c.1761C > G (p.Pro588Ala) with a novel complex deletion insertion mutation (c.1765_1766delinsGCCCGfs86*) in the HNF-1α gene among affected members of one family. Both mutations were present in the affected patients and neither was present in unaffected family members. The family had not only inheritance of MODY but also increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Therefore one family member had classical type 2 diabetes including metabolic syndrome aggravated by a genetic predisposition in the form of HNF1A-MODY."
