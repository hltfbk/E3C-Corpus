  "text": "A 13- year-old boy presented in emergency room with left hallux painful evolving for several months without any underlying trauma. The physical examination noted a localized swallowing of the dorsum of the right hallux base with no inflammatory local signs and a pain sensitivity induced by examination. Mobility of the adjacent joint was normal and no biological abnormalities were found. Radiographic examination showed a well-defined lytic lesion of the hallux proximal phalanx. Neither cortex erosion nor soft tissues abnormalities were noticed.\nAn initial biopsy was performed and showed typical features of a benign enchondroma.\nThe lesion was mechanically curetted and the cavity was packed with bone graft from the isolateral iliac crest.\nThe patients' postoperative period was uneventful with a successful healing and a satisfying clinical and radiological evolution.\nBy the fifth year postoperatively, the patient was presented with a new painful spurt of the big toe with a tumefaction that was significantly more pronounced than the initial clinical presentation.\nThe radiological findings exhibited an expanding multiloculated osteolytic lesion involving whole proximal phalanx with no soft tissue nor articular involvement. CT scan performed confirmed the osteolytic lesion with a focal cortical thinning with no fluid-fluid levels.\nRecurrence was suspected and a new biopsy was performed and pathological analysis revealed histological aspects in favor of GCRG with multinucleated giant cells dispersed throughout hyper cellular and highly vascularized stroma, and newly formed bone and osteoid, with osteoblastic prominence."
