  "text": "We present a patient from the Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Dermatologic Surgery at the Medical Institute-Ministry of Interior (MVR-Sofia), treated with the one-step melanoma surgery method with perfect final results. The preoperative tumour thickness determined via ultrasound and the postoperatively measured histological tumour thickness was identical: between 0.98 and 1 mm, which allowed removal of the melanoma lesion with a field of surgical security of 1 cm in all directions and did not require additional removal of a draining lymph node or excisions."
