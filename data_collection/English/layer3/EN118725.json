  "text": "We describe here a 4-months old Austrian infant who presented with a hard bulging painless mass of (5 x 3 cm) of the right parietal bone. Radiographs showed a large irregular osteolytic lesion. T1-weighted MR image showed significant expansile lesion associated with a dense zone of calcification in the diploic space. To the best of our knowledge this is the first clinical report of an infant with early presentation of monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the right parietal bone."
