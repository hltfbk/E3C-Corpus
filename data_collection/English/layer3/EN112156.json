  "text": "A 65-year-old male dog breeder with a history of rheumatoid arthritis, bilateral hip arthroplasties, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with a heart transplant 10 years ago presented with a three month history of progressive left hip pain and frank purulence on hip aspiration. He underwent irrigation and debridement of the left hip and one-stage revision with hardware exchange. Although gram stain and culture from synovial fluid and intraoperative cultures were initially negative, anaerobic cultures from tissue specimens later grew a spiral-shaped gram-negative rod, identified as Anaerobiospirillum spp. by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 6 weeks with a good response to treatment. A similar organism was unable to be isolated from culture of 2 of the patient's dogs, however, they were thought to be the most likely source of his infection."
