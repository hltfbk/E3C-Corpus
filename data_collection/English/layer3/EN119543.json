  "text": "A 48-year-old man presented with dysuria, passage of urinary sediment and lower abdominal discomfort. A three centimeter mass was identified by cystoscopy in the posterior midline of the bladder. Computerized tomography suggested an enterovesical fistula. The patient underwent laparotomy, partial cystectomy and partial small bowel resection. Pathological examination revealed PEComa of the bladder. The patient underwent adjuvant interferon-alpha immunotherapy. Subsequent follow-up procedures, including cystoscopy and imaging, have not revealed evidence of recurrence. The patient is clinically free of disease 48 months after surgery."
