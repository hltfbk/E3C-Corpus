  "text": "In this study we report on a family with three children with PCD and various laterality defects. In addition, one child (V:1) has mild-to-moderate developmental delay and one child has speech delay (V:2). Developmental delay is not usually associated with PCD and is likely to be caused by an additional genetic abnormality. Transmission electron microscopy showed variable inner and outer dynein arm defects. Exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense variant in CCDC103 (c.461A > C; p.His154Pro) as the most likely cause of the PCD and laterality defects in this family. However, as mutation in CCDC103 would not account for the developmental delay, array comparative genomic hybridisation was undertaken and identified a maternally inherited gain of ~1.6 Mb (chr17:34,611,352-36,248,918). Gains at this locus are associated with 17q12 duplication syndrome which includes speech and language delay."
