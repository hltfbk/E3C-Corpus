  "text": "A 48 year old Irish Caucasian female, who presented as a typical history of an aortic dissection (chest pain radiating to her back in an interscapular region and a systolic blood pressure differential of 50 mmHg between her right and left upper limbs), was investigated with a number of imaging modalities and diagnosed with Takayasu's Arteritis, involving arteries affecting a number of organs. She was treated as per protocol for Takayasu's Arteritis. A diagnosis of cervical cancer quickly followed."
