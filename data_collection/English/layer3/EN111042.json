  "text": "We report a case of an adolescent girl, recently diagnosed with ALL, who presented with pain in abdomen and breathing difficulty following chemotherapy with L-asparaginase. On subsequent evaluation, she was found to have high anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia and ketonuria. Ultrasonogram showed bulky pancreas. DKA was managed with fluid correction and insulin infusion. Pancreatitis was managed conservatively. She recovered completely with resolution of symptoms and without any major adverse events despite having such severe complications."
