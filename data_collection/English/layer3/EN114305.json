  "text": "Case 1, a 51-year-old Japanese female with high hyperopia (Right: +20.5 Dioptors, Left: +19.5 Dioptors), had axial lengths of 15.6 mm in both eyes. Case 2, a 55-year-old Japanese male with high hyperopia (Right: +22.5 Dioptors, Left: +22.8 Dioptors), had axial lengths of 14.8 and 14.7 mm in the right and left eyes, respectively. Choroidal thickness was measured at five sites in each eye using swept-source optical coherence tomography; subfoveal, nasal, temporal, superior and inferior (the 4 non-subfoveal sites were measured 3000 µm from the fovea)."
