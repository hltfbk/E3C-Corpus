  "text": "We report a case of a 30 year old woman who was admitted to a gynecology department for primary amenorrhea. Clinical examination revealed a female phenotype: the breasts were normally developed, however, the labia was small and we notice the absence of axial hair, pubic and groin. Gynecological examination puts in evidence the hymen, a short vagina (2cm) and no uterus.\nSexual hormones in blood were measured: Gonadotropins were found normal (FSH 6.64 mUI/mL, LH 26.65 mUI/mL), so the progesterone (6.89 nmol/L) and estradiol (58 pmol/L), nevertheless the testosterone 2G was high for a woman (58.61 ng/mL).\nThe karyotype was mapped and highlighted a male genotype 46XY.\nBecause of the lack of androgen receptor, gene abnormality research and an androgen binding test in a genital skin fibroblast were not realized.\nThus the pelvic MRI revealed the absence of uterus and ovaries, hypoplastic vagina, and intra-abdominal testes.\nLater on, she was referred to our urology department to undergo a laparoscopic removal of the undescended testes in order to avoid risk of malignancy. The testes were found inside the abdominal cavity. They were subsequently dissected and removed. Histopathology revealed two testes with atrophic seminiferous tubules containing only Sertoli cells, associated to a Leydig cells hyperplasia. Hopefully, no signs of testicular cancer were identified.\nPostoperative evolution was uneventful and the patient left hospital after one day.\nMentally, the patient kept seeing herself as a woman. So the decision to reveal the truth was difficult. Therefore, we opted for the establishment of psychological support and refer her to the endocrinology department to benefit from estrogen substitution therapy."
