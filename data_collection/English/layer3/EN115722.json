  "text": "We report the case of a 56 year-old man of asian origin who presented with a liver abscess of unknown origin, complicated by septic shock with multiorgan failure. He was later found to have a fishbone impacted in the left lobe of the liver, which had perforated the stomach and gone by unnoticed until presentation. The fishbone was extracted through laparotomy and the abscess was drained."
