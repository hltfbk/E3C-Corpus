  "text": "A 56-year-old man who underwent transsphenoidal surgery for craniopharyngioma 26 d ago presented gradual headache and cerebrospinal fluid leakage while vomiting 5 d post-discharge and required readmission to our department of neurosurgery. After admission, head imaging examination showed a hyperdense shadow in the superior sagittal sinus and right transverse sinus, edema at the bilateral parietal lobe, and hemorrhage at the left parietal lobe and right occipital lobe; the venous phase of cerebral angiography revealed CVST. The patient was treated immediately by intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy after the definite diagnosis. However, the neurological status of the patient continued to deteriorate and he died on the fourth day after readmission."
