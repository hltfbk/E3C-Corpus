  "text": "A 38-year-old female patient presented with a history of limping for 5 months and on evaluation revealed an expansile osteolytic lesion in fibular head with septations and soft tissue component. Excision biopsy was done. Histological examination revealed a cellular neoplasm arranged as vague nodules in chondroid background with occasional mitotic figures and giant cells in periphery without any calcification. To rule out chondroblastoma, S-100 and epithelial markers were done which was negative establishing diagnosis of CMF by exclusion."
