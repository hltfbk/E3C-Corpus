  "text": "Melorheostosis was diagnosed in 26-year old female after injury as an incidental finding. This was quite surprising as the patient already suffered by limited movement in the upper limb and pain before the injury. Detailed examination were performed to confirm the diagnosis, no family history was found. Pharmacotherapy with bisphosphonates, non-steroidal antirheumatics and vasodilatans/rheologic drugs seemed to be effective to maintain the relatively good quality of patient life and good performance in daily routine. Questionable is further development of patient performance status and sustainability of conservative treatment in the long term follow up."
