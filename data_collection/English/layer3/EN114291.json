  "text": "An 80-year-old man who was on immunosuppressive treatment due to a non-specific inflammatory disease of the liver and kidney presented to our hospital with recurrent fever, fatigue and bloody diarrhoea. Histopathological analysis from a colon biopsy showed intracellular amastigotes. The diagnosis of VL was confirmed by polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) of the colon biopsy. PCR was also performed in plasma, a bronchopulmonary lavage, a lymph node, liver and bone marrow biopsy and proved L. donovani as causative species. The disseminated infection was unresponsive to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B as recommended in immunosuppressed individuals despite stopping immunosuppressive treatment."
