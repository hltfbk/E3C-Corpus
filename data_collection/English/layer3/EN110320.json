  "text": "Case 1 : a 24-year-old female patient was referred to our department for the treatment of multiple impacted supernumerary teeth, which were detected on an orthopantomogram obtained at a dental clinic. An intraoral examination did not detect any abnormalities with regard to the size or shape of the patient's tooth crowns or the relationship between his dental age and chronological age, but a panoramic radiograph revealed three supernumerary teeth which were situated behind the 18, 48 and 38.\nThere was no any other specific oral finding and relevant familial history of dental abnormalities. The patient was educated about the presence of multiple supernumerary teeth and the extraction of the two mandibular supernumerary teeth was indicated before orthodontic treatment.\nCase 2 : a 19-year-old girl was referred to our department because of a recurrent pericoronitis relevant to the lower right third molar 48. General physical and extra oral examination did not show any abnormality and medical/family history was non-contributory. Orthopantomogram has revealed a presence of 3 supernumerary teeth which were situated behind the 18, 28 and 48. Surgical removal of the right mandibular supernumerary tooth was planned with extraction of the 48 and the others ST will remain under surveillance following the patient decision."
