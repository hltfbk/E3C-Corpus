  "text": "A 64-year-old man was referred to our department from his primary hospital because of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever for almost 10 d. Computed tomography showed colon wall thickening, with threadlike calcifications in the mesenteric vein in the transverse colon. Colonoscopy revealed purple-blue mucosa with multiple ulcers in the ascending and transverse colon. Biopsy showed thickening and calcification of the vein walls, perivascular and mucosal collagen degeneration, and amyloidosis. The patient had been consuming Chinese medicinal liquor, mainly that made from gardenia fruit, for 10 years. Based on these results, a diagnosis of MP with amyloidosis was made. After conservative treatment, the patient's discomfort subsided and he was followed closely. The use of Chinese herbal medicine was suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of MP."
