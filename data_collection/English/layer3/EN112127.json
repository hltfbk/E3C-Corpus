  "text": "A 69-year-old Caucasian female patient with a cardiac resynchronization therapy - defibrillator (CRT-D) due to dilated cardiomyopathy required the implantation of a supplementary left ventricluar resynchronization electrode. Because of unfavorable venous access, we chose a thoracoscopic approach. A bipolar suture-on epicardial electrode, was implanted by means of polypropylene monofilament 2-0 threads and automated titanium fasteners (Cor-KnotÂ®). The intervention was uneventful. The correct function of the device was confirmed postoperatively and the patient was dismissed within 3 days from hospital. Six months after implantation the cardiologic control asserted regular device function and restitution of normal ejection fraction (EF 60%)."
