  "text": "We present the case of a 67-year-old woman with progressive Zic4 antibody mediated PCD and rhombencephalitis. Immunomodulatory treatment, including intravenous methylprednisolone, plasmaphereses, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was detected, lobectomy performed and cyclophosphamide started. Despite this considerable therapeutic effort, rhombencephalitis led to defiant dysautonomia."
