  "text": "A 64-year-old man with IPF had nintedanib added to his ongoing pirfenidone therapy. He developed dyspnea after 65 days and presented with hypoxemia after 68 days. At presentation, chest computed tomography showed newly developed diffuse ground glass opacities with the pre-existing subpleural reticular shadows. Because of the absence of infection or other potential causative factors, we diagnosed an acute exacerbation of IPF. Nintedanib was temporarily discontinued and the acute exacerbation was successfully managed with intensive treatment. We re-initiated nintedanib 30 days after cessation, which helped stabilize his FVC for 8 months. Nintedanib was safely continued for 28 months until he died of a bacterial infection."
