  "text": "Here, we present two ADTC cases with distant metastases who were effectively treated by total thyroidectomy combined with lenvatinib to prolong a durable response to radioiodine therapy. Case 1 was a 66-year-old male diagnosed with ADTC and disseminated brain, lung, and bone metastases. Lenvatinib was initiated via compassionate access because of rapidly progressive tumor growth even after second doses of radioiodine therapy and external beam radiation therapy for his brain metastases. The result was a durable response to lenvatinib, slowing progressive tumor growth for 3 years and allowing a third course of radioiodine therapy to treat the bone metastases. Case 2 was a 45-year-old male diagnosed with ADTC and diffuse disseminated lung metastases. Respiratory failure ensued after total thyroidectomy, requiring mandatory support by respirator. Lenvatinib was started as a rescue therapy to reduce tumor burden rapidly. The patient was successfully weaned off the respirator only 1 week after using lenvatinib. The patient was then maintained on a low dose of lenvatinib, allowing three subsequent courses of radioiodine therapy. Currently, his lung metastasis remains well controlled with decreased lung infiltrating nodules and the patient can tolerate exercise well."
