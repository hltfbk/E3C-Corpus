  "text": "A 21-year-old Caucasian man received an elbow injury. An anteroposterior radiograph showed only an irregularity of the medial joint space, but a lateral radiograph showed an intra-articular half-moon-shaped fragment that had moved up and forward. A computed tomography scan confirmed an isolated fracture of his trochlea. Open reduction and internal fixation were performed with a good outcome."
