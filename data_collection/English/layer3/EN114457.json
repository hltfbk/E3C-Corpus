  "text": "We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with long-standing sarcoidosis who presented to clinic with diffuse painful plaques that were very distinct and suggestive of CCLE. She had a family history of both sarcoidosis and CCLE. The patient was immediately started on topical corticosteroids and oral hydroxychloroquine. Skin biopsy and the absence of direct immunofluorescence confirmed a skin manifestation of her previously diagnosed sarcoidosis, despite the clinical morphology favoring classic CCLE."
