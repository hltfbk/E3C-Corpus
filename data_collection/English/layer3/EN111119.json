  "text": "In this case study, we present a 25 year-old primigravida patient referred to HEAL Africa hospital for management of an acute abdomen at 33-weeks gestation. Her chief complaint was severe abdominal pain associated with each fetal movement for a period of 1 week prior to admission. A diagnosis of peritonitis was made. Emergency laparotomy revealed a normal live 2 kg baby with placental implantation on the greater omentum and small intestine mesentery. The placenta was not removed. Both maternal and fetal outcomes were good."
