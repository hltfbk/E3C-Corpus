  "text": "An 18 year old male was diagnosed to have culture-negative bilateral subdural empyema, which was drained and the patient was discharged, only to return 3 months later with a left temporo-parietal abscess that was drained and continued to show no growth on cultures and was non-responsive to multiple antibiotics. As a final effort, chloramphenicol therapy was begun and the patient showed immediate improvement and made a relatively uneventful recovery."
