  "text": "A 75-year-old man was referred to our hospital for the detailed investigation of serum hepatobiliary enzyme elevation. The patient had a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and an operative history of coronary artery bypass grafting 10 years before. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography found strictures of the right and left hepatic ducts with involvement of right anterior and posterior bile ducts. Adenocarcinoma was evident by brush cytology. We diagnosed these findings as hilar cholangiocarcinoma and planned left trisectionectomy including bile duct reconstruction. Although the tumor and RPHA were not adjacent, preoperative multidetector computed tomography revealed a stricture of the RPHA that was 5.6 mm in length. We suspected that atherosclerosis caused the stricture, and we performed digital subtraction angiography and intravascular ultrasonography that showed stricture of the RPHA accompanied by thick plaques in the arterial wall. We placed a bare-metal stent in the RPHA and then performed left trisectionectomy. Since this patient developed bile leakage postoperatively, percutaneous drainage was performed. The bile leakage was successfully controlled, and the patient was discharged 3 months after surgery. Unfortunately, 4 months after hepatectomy, he was re-hospitalized with multiple pyogenic liver abscesses. We performed intensive multimodal treatment for the liver abscesses and stabilized the disease; however, we eventually lost this patient due to liver failure 14 months after surgery."
