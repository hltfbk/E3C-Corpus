  "text": "A 20-year-old Asian man was admitted with non-specific abdominal pain, which later evolved to intestinal obstruction. Operative findings showed the small bowel obstruction was due to an omental band adhered to a nodule. Histopathology of the nodule revealed an infarcted appendix epiploica."
