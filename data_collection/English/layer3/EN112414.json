  "text": "A 78-year-old patient followed for a metastatic prostate cancer had been describing neuralgic dental pain in the lower posterior left quadrant for several months. Healing delay of tooth #37 (second left mandibular molar) extraction socket in the painful region led to an intra-alveolar incisional biopsy, which showed a tumor widely invading the mandibular body. Radiologic, histopathologic and clinical elements finally concluded to an intra-osseous carcinoma cuniculatum. Duration of total treatment (oral biopsy to hemimandibulectomy) and follow up were about five months and one year respectively. Patient died before reconstruction."
