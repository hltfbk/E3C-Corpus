  "text": "We have reported a 53-year-old Japanese woman with anaplastic carcinoma in an ovarian seromucinous cystic tumor of borderline malignancy. Her MRI and CT analysis revealed an ovarian tumor with a mural nodule, ascites, and peritoneal dissemination. Enhanced MRI revealed that the mural nodule was enhanced. Enhanced CT analysis revealed that the lymph nodes were not swollen. Intriguingly, the mural nodule crossed the cyst wall into the cavity and onto the surface. Her laboratory data revealed high serum CA 125 level. Cumulatively, these results suggested ovarian malignancy. The patient underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and resection of the disseminated lesions. Lymph node biopsy was omitted because of the suggestion of enhanced CT image findings and palpation during surgery. Her postoperative specimen examination determined FIGO at least stage IIIB, and accordingly, adjuvant chemotherapy was prescribed. After 3Â years of the operation, the patient is presently alive without clinical tumor recurrences."
