  "text": "A 48 year old post-menopausal women presented with abnormal uterine bleeding for which she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-ophorectomy. Gross examination revealed a gelatinous grayish white tumor confined to the myometrium, 7 cm in maximum dimention. Microscopic examination revealed monomorphic round to oval tumor cells in anastomosing cords and trabeculae with myxoid background. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells showed diffuse positivity for vimentin, CD99 and S100, while focal positivity was seen with pancytokeratin immunostain. The case was diagnosed as UTROSCT. No evidence of metastasis was found on systemic clinical and radiologic workup."
