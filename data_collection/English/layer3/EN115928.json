  "text": "We report the cases of two patients with clinically different inflammatory arthritis, both of whom are Indian men. Patient 1 was 30 years of age, and patient 2 was 50 years of age. They both had a history of meniscal tear, which we confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging scans. Synovial fluid samples obtained from these two patients were analyzed for proinflammatory markers, such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and nitric oxide, and also for glycosaminoglycan as a cartilage degradation indicator. Relatively high levels of IL-1β (2000.0 ± 15.7 pg/ml) and nitric oxide (4.73 ± 0.05 μM/ml) and relatively low glycosaminoglycan (93.75 ± 6.3 μg/ml) were observed in patient 1, corroborating the diagnosis of traumatic meniscal tear. Compared to patient 1, Patient 2 had relatively low levels of IL-1β (54.55 ± 14.5 pg/ml) and nitric oxide (20.00 ± 0.6 μM/ml) and remarkably high glycosaminoglycan levels (553.33 ± 1.7 μg/ml), coupled with significant osteophytes and profound cartilage loss, which indicated severe arthritis and a diagnosis of degenerative meniscal tear."
