  "text": "A 55-year-old male presented with hypotension requiring a large intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. He was diagnosed with the human immunodeficiency virus upon presentation. A computerized tomographic scan revealed air and fluid in the perineum and pelvis, ascending into the retroperitoneum. Multiple surgical debridements to his perineum, deep pelvic structures, and retroperitoneum were completed. After colostomy placement, antibiotic administration, and wound care, he was closed using split-thickness skin grafting."
