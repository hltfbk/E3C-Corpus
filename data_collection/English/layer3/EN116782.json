  "text": "We report the case of a young boy who presented with palpitations and high blood pressure as a result of energy drinks usage. He had been consuming a \"Sting\" energy drink on regular basis while studying for long hours during his O' level Exams. His medical examination revealed Sinus tachycardia and high blood pressure. Rest of the examination and lab workup was within normal limits. His pulse and blood pressure returned to normal range after discontinuing Sting usage."
