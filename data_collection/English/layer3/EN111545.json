  "text": "A 71-year-old Japanese man with a history of aortic valve replacement developed rapidly progressive renal dysfunction with gross hematuria and proteinuria. Blood analysis showed a high proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (163â€‰IU/ml) titer. Streptococcus species was detected from two separate blood culture bottles. Transesophageal echocardiography detected mitral valve vegetation. Histological evaluation of renal biopsy specimens showed necrosis and cellular crescents in glomeruli without immune complex deposition. The patient met the modified Duke criteria for definitive infective endocarditis. On the basis of these findings, the patient was diagnosed with proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis complicated by Streptococcus infective endocarditis. His renal disease improved, and his proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titer normalized with antibiotic monotherapy."
