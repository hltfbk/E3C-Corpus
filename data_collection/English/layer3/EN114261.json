  "text": "A 46-year-old female presented with a four year history of palpable mass lesion just below the lateral aspect of right elbow with clinical evidence of posterior interosseous nerve compression. X-ray showed the presence of a radiolucency mass in relation to radius. HRUS demonstrated a hyperechoic mass in soft tissue with a focal irregularity in bony cortex of radius. The mass lesion compressed the posterior interosseous nerve."
