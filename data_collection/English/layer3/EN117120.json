  "text": "A 40-year-old Caucasian man sustained a small right temporal epidural hematoma and nondisplaced right skull fractures after a fall from a roof. He was managed conservatively; a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine was administered and a week later he was discharged home. A few days after his discharge, he experienced weakness and numbness in his legs, which progressed to involve his arms. Three weeks after his initial fall, he was readmitted with quadriparesis. A lumbar puncture revealed a cerebrospinal fluid protein of 790 mg/dL and one white blood cell. We diagnosed Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. Our patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. Three months later his muscle strength had improved, but he continued to have tingling in his hands and feet and used a walker intermittently."
