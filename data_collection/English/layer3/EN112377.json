  "text": "The first case involved a 71-year-old man who underwent abdominoperineal rectal resection for rectal cancer. Preoperative CT revealed a mass in the right adrenal, which was growing after surgery. After chemotherapy the adrenal mass decreased in size, and adrenalectomy was performed at 8 months after the first surgery. A pathological examination confirmed metastasis from rectal cancer. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and is currently alive without recurrence at 9 years after the adrenalectomy. The second case involved a 53-year-old man who underwent sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer. Four years later, lobectomy was performed for isolated lung metastasis. Twenty months later, PET-CT revealed solitary metastasis in the left adrenal gland and adrenalectomy was performed. A histopathological examination revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma of sigmoid cancer. Postoperative chemotherapy was administered after adrenalectomy and the patient is currently alive and apparently disease-free at more than 9 years after undergoing adrenal metastasectomy."
