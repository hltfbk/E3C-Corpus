  "text": "Blood samples were collected from six PJS families including eight patients. Mutation screening of STK11 gene was performed in these six families by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. Three novel mutations (c.721G > C, c.645_726del82, and del(exon2-5)) and three recurrent mutations (c.752G > A, c.545 T > C and del(exon1)) in STK11 were detected in six Chinese PJS families. Genotype-phenotype correlations suggested that truncating mutations trend to result in severe complications."
