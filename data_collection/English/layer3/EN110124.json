  "text": "We here report a case of a 78 year old woman, with free medical history, who presented to the Emergency Department of our Hospital with erythema nodosum on her both shins. She also mentioned low grade fever since 15 days and a positive family history of tuberculosis (daughter). Her chest X-Ray revealed bilateralhilar lymphadenopathy, mainly at the right side. Further evaluation with High Resolution chest Computed Tomography confirmed the lymphadenopathy and demonstrated ground-glass opacities. The Mantoux skin test was strongly positive (22 mm). Anti-TB treatment was started, based on the positive Mantoux test, the compatible imaging findings and mainly, the history of close and direct exposure. Sputum cultures proved to be positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Patientâ€™s response to treatment was impressive and in her follow up visits, she remained free of symptoms and a define improvement of her imaging findings was observed."
