  "text": "A 23-year-old male patient was referred to our center with fever, altered mental status and abnormal gait. Neurologic examination revealed Wernicke's aphasia. Cardiac auscultation revealed systolic murmur at the left sternal border. ECG (electrocardiogram) was unremarkable. Brain MRI showed multiple cerebellar lesions. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated three large masses on the right ventricle (RV), tricuspid valve (TV), and anterior mitral valve (MV) leaflet. Blood cultures (three sets) were negative. Intravenous heparin therapy was administered. After 48â€‰h, the second TTE demonstrated that one valvular lesion disappeared and the other two lesions showed a significant decrease in size. The patient's neurological symptoms resolved gradually. Further workup for collagen vascular disorders did not show any abnormality."
