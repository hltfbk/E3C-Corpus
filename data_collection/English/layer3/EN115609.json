  "text": "A 74-year-old African American male with a diagnosis of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy for several years, presented with gradually worsening dyspnea on exertion and lower extremity edema. There is no known cardiac disease in his family. An echocardiogram was done showing a decrease in ejection fraction to 30% from 45% in the span of a year. An endomyocardial biopsy analysis identified transthyretin amyloid with the Val122Ile mutation, confirming the diagnosis of familial transthyretin cardiomyopathy."
