  "text": "the subject is a 44 years old man presenting an abdominal pain on the right side, with a palpable mass which appeared four months ago. Abdominal ultrasound (echography) revealed a retroperitoneal cystic process, which was successfully resected through laparotomy. Histopathological examination concluded to a mucinous cystadenoma with borderline malignancy foci. After a year of follow-up, no relapse was noticed in this patient."
