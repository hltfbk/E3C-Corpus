  "text": "Here we diagnosed a 38-year-old man, who was found CCTGA 14 years ago, as spontaneous chordae rupture by real-time three dimentional transesophageal echocardiography (RT-3D-TEE). The present case is the first report to describe a CCTGA patient combine with spontaneous chordae rupture in tricuspid valve. After tricuspid valve replacement, the patient was uneventful after 6 years' follow-up."
