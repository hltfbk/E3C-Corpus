  "text": "A 53-year-old woman was affected by recto-sigmoid junction cancer and a solid 5 cm left renal mass. We performed a simultaneous robotic low anterior rectal resection and renal enucleation. Total operative time was 260 min with robotic time of 220 min; estimated blood loss was 150 ml; time to flatus was 72 h, and oral diet was administered 4 days after surgery. The patient was discharged on the eighth post-operative day without peri- and post-operative complication. The definitive histological examination showed a neuroendocrine tumor pT2N1 G2, with negative circumferential and distal resection margins. Renal tumor was angiomyolipoma. At 23 months follow-up, the patient is recurrence free."
