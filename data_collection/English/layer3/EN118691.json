  "text": "We report the case of a 64-year-old woman with esophageal cancer who developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a form of reversible heart failure, and we present a review of the literature. Patients present with symptoms similar to an acute coronary syndrome; however, cardiac catheterization reveals patent coronary arteries, and symptoms of heart failure resolve completely within weeks."
