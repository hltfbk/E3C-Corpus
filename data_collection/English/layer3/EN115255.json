  "text": "A 41-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a 14-day history of subacute intermittent right lower quadrant abdominal pain. Simple abdominal radiography and abdominal computed tomography findings were suggestive of sigmoid volvulus, and she underwent an emergency colonoscopy. Following colonoscopic reduction, the patient's symptoms resolved quickly, and elective laparoscopic surgery was scheduled 2Â weeks after admission. Intraoperative examination revealed a significantly distended cecum and ascending colon, which was twisted around a short rope-like adhesion that connected the cecum and the mesentery of the transverse colon, whereas the sigmoid colon was neither twisted nor extended. We laparoscopically performed an ileocecal resection. The postsurgery histopathological examination revealed the presence of endometrial tissue in the short rope-like adhesion. This finding confirmed that cecal volvulus in this patient was caused by endometriosis."
