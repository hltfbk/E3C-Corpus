  "text": "This study reports two novel, intronic NIPBL genetic variants in unrelated CdLS patients with the characteristic phenotype. A c.6954 + 3A > C substitution and a c.5862 + 1delG deletion were identified, one of each, in a 6 year-old boy and 39 month-old girl. Further studies confirmed that both variants introduce premature termination codons, resulting in the formation of truncated proteins p.(Ser2255LeufsTer20) and p.(Leu1955Ter), respectively."
