  "text": "A 33-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted with a history of secondary infertility and with a regular menstrual cycle. She reported a miscarriage at 12 weeks of gestation 7 years previously and subsequent dilatation and curettage in another medical facility. Vaginal ultrasound was performed and showed an intrauterine structure described as a hyperechogenic image suggesting calcification related to chronic endometritis. Office hysteroscopy revealed a wide endometrial cavity and proliferative endometrium, with a coral-like white plaque 1.5 cm in length on the right horn and posterior wall of the uterus. The lesion was treated by hysteroscopy without complications. Microscopic examination showed endometrial tissue with osseous metaplasia in the stroma. Nine months after the procedure, the patient became pregnant spontaneously."
