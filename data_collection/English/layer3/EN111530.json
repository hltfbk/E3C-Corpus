  "text": "We present a case of a 62-year-old Caucasian female with a history of rectal adenocarcinoma. Four years ago, the patient underwent low anterior resection of the rectosigmoid, post neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, with adjuvant chemotherapy. During her follow-up, imaging examinations revealed a lesion in the pancreatic neck with features indicating primary pancreatic cancer. Near-total distal pancreatectomy with en bloc splenectomy was performed. Histopathology revealed metastatic disease compatible with colorectal adenocarcinoma as the primary cancer. Second-line chemotherapy was decided from the institutional tumor board. The patient remains disease free one year later."
