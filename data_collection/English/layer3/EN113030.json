  "text": "A 10-year-old girl born to healthy non-consanguineous parents with delayed development is described. She started walking unaided by 9Â years with a significantly unsteady gait and her speech was similarly delayed. Physical examination revealed multiple cerebellar signs. Slit lamp examination of eyes revealed bilateral partial aniridia. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain at the age of 10 years revealed cerebellar (mainly vermian) hypoplasia. Genetic testing confirmed the clinical suspicion and demonstrated a heterozygous pathogenic variant c.7786_7788delAAG p.(Lys2596del) in the ITPR1 gene."
