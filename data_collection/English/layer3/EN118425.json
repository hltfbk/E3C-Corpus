  "text": "A 62 year old male presented with jaundice, abdominal pain, anorexia, steatorrhoea and dark urine. Ultrasound demonstrated a mass in the head of the pancreas causing common bile duct obstruction. Histology confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. He was subsequently noted to have a migratory, tender and erythematous rash consistent with thrombophlebitis migrans."
