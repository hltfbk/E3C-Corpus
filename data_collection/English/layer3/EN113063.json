  "text": "Here, we report the successful treatment of a mycophenolate-resistant organizing pneumonia (OP) with infliximab in a patient with metastatic melanoma after PD-1 blockade. The patient received two years of PD-1 targeted immunotherapy when he developed multiple nodular lung lesions mimicking a metastatic progression. However, wedge resection of these lesions showed defined areas of OP, which responded well to corticosteroids. Upon tapering, new foci of OP developed which were resistant to high-dose steroids and mycophenolate treatment. The TNFα antagonist infliximab led to a rapid and durable regression of the inflammatory lesions."
