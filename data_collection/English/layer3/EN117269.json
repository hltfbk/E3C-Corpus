  "text": "In this report, we describe the case of a 16-year-old Indian girl who presented to our hospital with swelling on the scalp which had progressed from the hairline to just above the left brow, causing mechanical ptosis. She was born with a black-pigmented triangular patch covered with hair over the scalp which had increased in size over a period of eight years after birth. An X-ray of her skull and ultrasonography revealed soft tissue swelling in the left temporofrontoparietal region. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain showed the presence of 8.99 cm Ã— 2.26 cm abnormal signal intensity involving the scalp, a few small tubers with cortical dysplasia in the left frontoparietal region with asymmetric dilatation, and the presence of calcified subependymal nodules within the left lateral ventricle. These findings were suggestive of tuberous sclerosis. A histopathological examination of the swelling was suggestive of congenital melanocytic nevi. The patient underwent surgery. Excision of the tumor with primary skin grafting was done, with the graft being taken from the medial aspect of the right thigh."
