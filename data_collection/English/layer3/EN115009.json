  "text": "A 66 year-old woman without any systemic disease presented with blurred vision due to a severe vitreous opacity in the right eye. Flow cytometric analysis of the vitreous fluid suggested a natural killer cell tumor. Moreover, cytologic examination of vitreal and retinal specimens revealed the infiltration of a natural killer cell tumor, while PCR and immunocytochemistry revealed Epstein-Barr virus infection. The results of a gene rearrangement analysis were positive for IGH, while TCR beta chains were all negative. We examined the patient with whole-body magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, and performed a bone marrow examination. These examinations returned no abnormal results."
