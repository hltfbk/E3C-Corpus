  "text": "Thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis by retrosternal route reconstruction was performed in all three cases. All patients were men ranging in age from 60 to 80â€‰years. Two patients had abdominal pain, and one had experienced syncope. All patients were diagnosed by computed tomography with an internal hernia to the retrosternal space and thoracic cavity (retrosternal hernia) without ischemic change to the incarcerated intestine. Two patients received medical therapy to relieve their intra-abdominal pressure, which allowed for a successful reduction of the intestine into the abdomen. Open laparotomy was performed to repair the hernia in the third patient. After reducing the intestine into the abdomen, reefing of the retrosternal orifice was performed, and the gastric conduit was anchored to the abdominal wall. No relapse occurred in three cases throughout follow-up."
