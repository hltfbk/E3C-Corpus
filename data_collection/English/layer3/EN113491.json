  "text": "A 46-year-old male presented with swelling and pain in the right wrist and was diagnosed with conventional osteosarcoma of the distal radius. The patient responded well to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the tumor shrank remarkably. Wide tumor excision to preserve the radiocarpal joint and reconstruction with a tumor bearing frozen autograft were performed. Partial bone union was detected 3 months postoperatively and complete bone union was detected 9 months postoperatively. Following the surgery, there was immediate commencement of the range of motion (ROM) training in both the wrist and fingers. At the final postoperative follow-up of 41 months, the patient had normal ROM in the wrist, fingers, and forearms, with a score of 100% in the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score and was disease free."
