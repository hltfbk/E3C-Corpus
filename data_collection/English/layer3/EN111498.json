  "text": "We report a rare case of death in a 41-year-old man with severe odontogenic multi-space infections in the oral and maxillofacial head and neck regions. One week before admission, due to pain in the right lower posterior teeth, the patient placed a cigarette butt dipped in the pesticide \"Miehailin\" into the \"dental cavity\" to relieve the pain. Within a week, the infection gradually spread bilaterally to the floor of the mouth, submandibular space, neck, chest, waist, back, temporal and other areas. The patient had difficulty breathing, swallowing and eating, and was transferred to our hospital as an emergency admission. Following admission, oral and maxillofacial surgeons immediately organized consultations with doctors in otolaryngology, thoracic surgery, general surgery, hematology, anesthesia and the intensive care unit to assist with treatment. The patient was treated with the highest level of antibiotics (vancomycin) and extensive abscess incision and drainage in the oral, maxillofacial, head and neck, chest and back regions. Unfortunately, the patient died of septic shock and multiple organ failure on the third day after admission."
