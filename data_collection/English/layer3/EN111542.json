  "text": "A 71-year-old gentleman with pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent the Whipple procedure in September 2014. The patient received 8 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabineand achieved a complete responsein April 2015. Treatment with the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab was started due to suspected tumour recurrence in November 2015. In August 2016, the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab was added to nivolumab for 2 cycles. Eight weeks after the last dose, the patient developed severe myositis complicated with spontaneous haematomain skeletalmuscle. Pathology of the skeletal muscle autopsy revealed lymphocytic infiltration. Intense immunosuppressive therapy, including high-dose corticosteroids and methotrexate, resulted in clinical success in the treatment of myositis. However, the patient died of cancer recurrence."
