  "text": "Forty-two year old Caucasian male with treatment-refractory chronic plaque psoriasis who developed new onset diarrheal illness and rectal bleeding following a 12â€‰week induction period with Ixekizumab (anti-IL-17 neutralizing antibody). Colonoscopy revealed severe ulceration throughout the ascending and transcending colon. Histopathology, combined with endoscopic findings, led to a diagnosis of Crohn's-like colitis. The patient's anti-IL-17 medication was discontinued and endoscopic remission was induced with the use of corticosteroids, escalated anti-TNF therapy and eventually anti IL-12/23 neutralizing antibody (ustekinumab)."
