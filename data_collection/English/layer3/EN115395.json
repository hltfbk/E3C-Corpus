  "text": "A 33-year-old Chilean man with fever secondary to parainfluenza 2 virus infection developed progressive cholestasis, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia and an increased ferritin level (>2000 IU/L). A bone marrow analysis showed hemophagocytosis. Our patient received HLH-94 chemotherapy, and he achieved complete and sustained remission after a two-year follow-up, without the need for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."
