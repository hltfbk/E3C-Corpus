  "text": "Herein, we reported a 34-year-old woman whom previously had diagnosed with asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and Sj√∂gren's syndrome (SS) referred our nephrology department due to acute kidney failure development at the last rheumatology visit. After kidney biopsy she has been diagnosed with IgG4-RD and tubuluointerstitial nephritis. She had been accepted resistant to steroid, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate and azathioprine therapies due to receiving in last two years. She refused to receive cyclophosphamide due to potential gonadotoxicity of the drug. Thus, rituximab therapy was considered. She received 1000 mg infusion, 15 d apart and 6 mo later it has been administered same protocol. After one year from the last rituximab dose serum creatinine decreased from 4.4 mg/dL to 1.6 mg/dL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased from 109 mm/h to 13 mm/h [reference range (RR) 0-20], and C-reactive protein decreased from 55.6 mg/L to 5 mg/L (RR 0-6). All pathologic lymph nodes and masses were also disappeared."
