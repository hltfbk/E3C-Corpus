  "text": "A 41 years old woman with diagnosis of ADPKD had been in treatment with tolvaptan for 16 weeks when an elevation of liver enzyme levels was detected. She had taken autonomously amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (in doses of 825/175 mg twice a day for 7 days) about 5 weeks before. The timing of the event and the kind of hepatocellular injury could be attributed to the concomitance of medication of tolvaptan and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid."
