  "text": "A 41-year-old male presented to the retina clinic with complaints of seeing a black spot, blurred vision and metamorphopsia involving the right eye for the past 4 months. He was on treatment for androgenic alopecia with topical 5% Minoxidil application on scalp two times a day. He noticed the symptoms 8 months after starting the treatment and had stopped the medication since the past 2 months. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye with +78D lens on slit lamp revealed the presence of subretinal fluid and few focal spots of retinal pigment epithelial alterations. Optical coherence tomography scan evaluation showed the presence of subretinal fluid (SRF) and pachychoroid supporting the diagnosis of CSCR. Indocyanine green angiography revealed dilated hyperpermeable choroidal vasculature on the nasal side of the fovea in the early and later phases of the angiogram. The patient was diagnosed with CSCR as a possible consequence of the topical minoxidil solution. Patient was asked to avoid future use of Minoxidil and was started on oral eplerenone therapy 50 mg/day for 4 consecutive weeks. One month later, there was complete resolution of his symptoms and SRF. At the final follow-up visit, 2 months after starting the therapy, there was no recurrence of SRF."
