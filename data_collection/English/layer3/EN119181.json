  "text": "Here we report a case of virilization associated with an extensive gastric adenocarcinoma and Krukenberg tumor in a premenopausal woman. Virilization occurred three months after diagnosis of gastric cancer and the ovarian tumors. Palliative chemotherapy was initiated as primary therapy, but gastric outlet obstruction required a gastrojejunostomy. In addition, oopherectomy was performed to relieve abdominal tension and to abate hormonal effects. It is likely that virilization of the patient could have been prevented by earlier oopherectomy prior to development of hormone production."
