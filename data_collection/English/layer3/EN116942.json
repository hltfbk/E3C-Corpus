  "text": "A 60-year-old male kidney recipient developed allograft dysfunction after angiotensin II receptor blockade for hypertension 4 months after transplantation. It was proven that one of two arterial branches of the graft was markedly stenotic. Graft dysfunction improved after percutaneous transluminal arterioplasty (PTA), however; the stenosis recurred and massive proteinuria developed 5 months later. Graft biopsy showed ischemic changes in the region fed by the stenotic artery branch and in contrast FSGS-like changes in the region fed by the other branch. His clinicopathological manifestation including massive proteinuria almost normalized after the repeat PTA."
