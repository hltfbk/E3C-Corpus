  "text": "A 59-year-old female patient with a history of sarcoidosis was admitted to the hospital with a one-day history of sudden onset of right-sided partial ptosis and diplopia. Neurosarcoidosis with cranial nerve involvement was considered, but was ruled out by the clinical findings, and MG was confirmed by the positive tensilon test, electrophysiological findings and positive acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies. On further evaluation, a CT chest scan showed a left anterior mediastinal mass and bilateral lymphadenopathy. Post surgical diagnosis confirmed the thymoma and sarcoidosis in the lymph nodes."
