  "text": "We report the case of a boy aged 03 years and 05 months, referred to the imaging department for intense generalized non-febrile seizures, drug-resistant and evolving gradually since his first year of life. The patient was also mentally retarded and the examination found no cutaneous angioma or eye problems. No history of familial epilepsy or parental consanguinity was found. A contrast brain CT was carried out. It made it possible to highlight an atrophy of the right cerebral hemisphere, seat of multiple gyriform cortical calcifications predominantly frontotemporal. On the phases after injection of contrast, a hypertrophy and hyper vascularization of the right choroid plexus, corresponding to the choroidal angioma, is visualized. The importance of cerebral calcifications did not allow to highlight a possible pial angioma. No other brain or eye abnormalities were identified. In total, the gyriform cerebral calcifications associated with choroid angioma in this context of seizures in this child made it possible to make the diagnosis of Sturge Weber Syndrome."
