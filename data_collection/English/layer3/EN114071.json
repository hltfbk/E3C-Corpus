  "text": "We report a case of thorn prick injury to the left patella in an 8-years-old boy who neglected the incident of thorn prick while playing with his peer group 10 days ago and presented with features of sub-acute septic arthritis. He was treated by arthrotomy, double inspection of the patella, removal of foreign body, synovectomy, lavage, antibiotics, and aggressive rehabilitation with an excellent outcome."
