  "text": "We describe the case of a 76-year-old white man with new-onset ataxia, stridor, areflexia, and upper and lower extremity weakness who required intubation at presentation. An initial work-up including imaging studies and serum tests was inconclusive. Eventually, neurophysiological testing and cerebrospinal fluid analysis suggested a diagnosis of Miller Fisher syndrome. Our patient responded to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and supportive therapy."
