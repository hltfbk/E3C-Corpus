  "text": "The example of a healthy 67-year-oldÂ German woman who was treated at our university hospital presents a typical progression of a localized form of tularemia. The pathogen could be identified in a universal 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase chain reaction. Pathogen-specific treatment with lymph node abscess incision, daily rinsing of the abscess cavity, and orally administered antibiotic therapy with doxycycline could cure our patient completely without any remaining complications."
