  "text": "A 52-year-old man presented with refractory generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed thickening of the meninges with enhancement near the superior sagittal sinus; skull bone defect was also noted. Extensive excision of affected skull bone and dura was performed, providing the diagnosis of IgG4-related pachymeningitis. After the surgery, the patient's seizure stopped and he was smoothly tapered off antiepileptic medication."
