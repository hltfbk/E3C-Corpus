  "text": "A 33-year-old man with Scheie syndrome presented with neck and radicular pain, upper extremity weakness, and insecure gait. The workup studies revealedcervical spine stenosis at multiple levels, caused by accumulation of soft tissue, within the cervical spinal canal. D espite the high risks of anesthesia, and the patient's inherent poor bone quality that could lead to failure of spinal fusion, we decided to proceed with surgery; indeed, decompressive laminectomies combined with C1-7 posterior stabilization led to immediate pain relief. Despite counter advised, the patient returned to sports rather early, and 6months after index procedure neck pain relapsed, while screw breakage and cutout occurred at the level of C7. Consequently, the initial instrumentation was revised and extended at T2 level. At 2years follow-up, the patient remained continuously pain-free and ambulatory."
