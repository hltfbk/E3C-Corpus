  "text": "A 69Â years old female evaluated for chronic headache was found to have a supra-sellar mass lesion that mimicked a pituitary tumor, with biochemical evidence of hypopituitarism. Cerebral angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of an aneurysm of the intracavernous internal carotid artery. She was successfully treated with coil embolization of the aneurysm and achieved resolution of symptoms and return of biochemistries to normal."
