  "text": "A 57 year-old lady sprained her left ankle resulting in grade 3 injury of the superior peroneal retinaculum and was treated by endoscopic retinaculum reconstruction. The fracture healed and the peroneal tendons were stabilized. However, it was complicated by protusion of the suture anchors into the posterolateral ankle gutter. The implants were successfully removed endoscopically."
