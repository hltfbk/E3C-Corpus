  "text": "This is a case report of necrotizing fasciitis involving the lower lip as a consequence of infected skin acne in a 19 year old black female. The patient had been diagnosed earlier as a case of angioedema by a physician and treated accordingly. She was mildly anemic, hyponatremic and hypokalemic. Treatment was started immediately by incision, drainage and full debridement of the whole necrotic tissue. Triple antibiotic therapy was administered and daily irrigation and dressing were performed until full recovery. Complete healing occurred within a month by secondary intention."
