  "text": "A 52-year-old man presented for blurred vision in his right eye. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 3/10 in his right eye and 7/10 in his left eye. Physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests lead to the diagnosis of bilateral RP with CME in the right eye. Retinal thickness in the foveal area of the right eye was 631 μm. The patient was treated with a single intravitreal injection of 0.05 ml/0.5 mg aflibercept. One month later, BCVA of the right eye increased to 4/10, while BCVA of the left eye was unchanged. RT in the right eye decreased to 129 μm. Multifocal electroretinogram response did not improve, yet peaks were better-shaped and no areas of eccentral vision were present. Three and six months after injection, these improvements were maintained."
