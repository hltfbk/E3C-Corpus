  "text": "A 40-year-old male treated for bilateral acetabular fracture sustained after fall from height due to an episode of seizure. After acetabular surgery, he developed surgical site infection unresponsive to wound wash and intravenous antibiotics. After two weeks, we started treatment with Qurion solution and Vacuum assisted suction (QiVAS) to which patient responded very well and his infection was cured. We are not aware of any study or case report using QiVAS therapy for treatment of infection associated with orthopaedic implant."
