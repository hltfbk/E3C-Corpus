  "text": "The patient was a 31-year-old woman who developed recurrent episodes of high fever associated with cervical adenitis, pharyngitis and vomiting started 9 months after a delivery. She was diagnosed with PFAPA syndrome and cimetidine 800 mg/day was initiated. Since then, these symptoms got better. Cimetidine treatment was discontinued since she became pregnant (6 weeks of pregnancy). Except one febrile episode at 8 weeks gestation, she did not develop a febrile episode during pregnancy. Peripheral blood Th1/Th2 ratio was decreased from the first trimester to the second trimester of pregnancy. Then again, the ratio was steadily elevated during the third trimester. At 38 weeks, she delivered a live born infant without any complication. Two months after delivery, she developed PFAPA syndrome again and cimetidine treatment was re-initiated. However, febrile episodes were not controlled well, and Th1/Th2 ratio was further elevated compared to pregnancy status. Colchicine 0.5 mg once a day was initiated. Symptoms were diminished and Th1/Th2 ratio was gradually decreased."
