  "text": "We present the medical case of a 51-year-old female Caucasian patient, who was diagnosed with a poorly differentiated stage IV (International Union Against Cancer staging) adenocarcinoma of the lung. While undergoing treatment, our patient developed extreme leukocytosis, for which, despite extensive diagnostic tests, no infection-related or hematological cause could be identified. The tumor proved to be highly resistant to treatment. Our patient died only five months after the initial diagnosis."
