  "text": "A 53-year-old man presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Coronary angiography revealed an ectatic right coronary artery (RCA) that was completely occluded in the mid portion by a large amount of thrombus. Catheter-directed intracoronary thrombolysis with alteplase led to recovery of coronary blood flow, which multiple attempts of aspiration thrombectomy had failed to achieve. Coronary angiography 9 days later showed good blood flow and insignificant stenosis remaining in the RCA; this had completely resolved in 6 months' follow-up coronary angiography."
