  "text": "We report the case of a 55-year-old white man who presented with a large exophytic lesion on his tongue. A biopsy was taken, and pathologic examination showed a poorly differentiated carcinoma including a sarcomatoid component. Subtotal glossectomy with neck dissection were planned, but a positron emission tomographic-computed tomography scan showed a left kidney mass. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the tongue lesion was performed, and it was compatible with metastasis from primary renal cell carcinoma. The biopsy of the renal lesion showed a high-grade unclassified renal cell carcinoma. Although our patient underwent systemic therapy, he died of hemorrhagic complications 3 months after the initiation of therapy."
