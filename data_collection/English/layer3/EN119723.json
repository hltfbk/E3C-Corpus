  "text": "We report the case of a 50-year old female with a mucinous adenocarcinoma forming in the perineum eleven years after proctocolectomy for Crohn's disease. The patient was readmitted with perineal pain, leucocytosis and a perineal mass highly suspicious of abscess formation in the MRI-Scan. Histological examination revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma. Exenteration including vagina, uterus and ovaries together with the coccygeal-bone was performed."
