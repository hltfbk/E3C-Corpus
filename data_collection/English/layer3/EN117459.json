  "text": "We report the case of a 36-year-old Malaysian woman who presented with a three-year history of gradually increasing swelling of the left breast, with skin changes. Examination revealed a huge, globular, lobulated mass measuring 400 mm by 350 mm. The patient had a mastectomy with an immediate latissimus dorsi pedicled myocutaneous flap reconstruction. The breast weighed 8.27 kg, and ex vivo, the tumor measured 280 mm by 250 mm by 180 mm. Histopathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis as a giant phyllodes tumor. At 12-month follow-up, the patient reports no complications and is satisfied with the aesthetic outcome."
