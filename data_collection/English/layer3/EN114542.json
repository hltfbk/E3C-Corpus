  "text": "We report here about an extremely rare case with hyperplastic gingivitis as the first sign of recurrence of GPA in the absence of oral manifestations in the primary disease. A 72 year-old female was referred to our Department of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery with hyperplastic gingivitis. The patient was diagnosed with GPA already eight years before. We referred the patient to our Clinic of Internal Medicine where she was successfully treated with rituximab. At the follow-up visit, the patient showed complete remission of the hyperplastic gingiva."
