  "text": "The subject was a 51-year-old woman. In October 2013, she was examined by a primary care physician for blurred vision in her left eye. Dyscoria and abnormality of the corneal endothelium were observed, and the patient was diagnosed with ICE syndrome. In November of the same year, she was referred to our institution with a decrease in visual acuity and CME, both in her left eye. At initial examination, her best corrected decimal visual acuity was 1.0 (Snellen equivalent: 20/20) in the right eye and 0.5 (20/40) in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 12 mmHg in both eyes. She was diagnosed with Cogan-Reese syndrome based on marked ectropion uveae, peripheral anterior synechia, and abnormalities of the corneal endothelium. Marked CME was observed on ophthalmoscopy and optical coherence tomography. A topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nepafenac 0.1 %) was applied to the left eye four times daily from January 2014. Four weeks later, the CME had resolved and her visual acuity was 1.0 (20/20)."
