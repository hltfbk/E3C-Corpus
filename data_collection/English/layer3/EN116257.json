  "text": "We herein report the case of an 82-year-old Asian Japanese female with rheumatoid arthritis and Pneumocystis pneumonia who was being treated with low-dose tacrolimus and low-dose methylprednisolone therapy. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at 52 years of age and was administered oral low-dose methylprednisolone and salazosulfapyridine. Her condition had been stable under this treatment for 30 years. However, her arthralgia worsened three months before admission. The salazosulfapyridine was changed to tacrolimus (0.5 mg/day) by her physician, and her arthralgia almost completely disappeared. She was admitted to our hospital for Pseudomonas pneumonia, and her symptoms improved almost completely with intravenous ceftazidime therapy. However, on the 14th day of admission, she developed acute respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis pneumonia and died on the 17th day of admission in spite of adequate treatment."
