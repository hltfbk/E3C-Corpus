  "text": "The patient is a 36-year-old female, G3P1, who presented at 37 weeks of gestation in active labor scheduled for elective primary CD. A spinal anesthetic was performed at L4-L5 with hyperbaric 0.75% bupivacaine, without intrathecal morphine. Bilateral posterior QL catheters were placed under sterile conditions with 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine per side. Continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine was then started at 10 mL/hour per side. The patient's pain was controlled with QL catheters and a multimodal pain regimen consisting of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. The patient reported a resting pain score of 0 with a dynamic pain score of 3 out of 10 throughout her recovery. She was discharged on post-operative (post-op) day 3 and the catheters were removed without any complications."
