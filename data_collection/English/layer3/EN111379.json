  "text": "A 29-year-old unemployed white man with no significant past medical history or family history of coronary artery disease, who was a current smoker with a 1-pack-per-day history, presented to our hospital with a 1-month history of intermittent chest pain. His chest pain was localized to the right side with a pressure-like quality, moderate intensity 4-6/10, nonradiating, and relieved by standing up and worsened by lying flat. His pain was not associated with increase or decrease in activity level. The pain had progressively worsened, which prompted the patient to come to the emergency room. The patient was admitted for further evaluation. A chest x-ray showed a suspected loop of bowel on the right side of the chest. Subsequently, the patient underwent computed tomography of the chest, which revealed a 7-cm defect in the right hemidiaphragm with a large amount of intra-abdominal fat and a loop of the proximal transverse colon within the hernial sac. The patient was evaluated by a surgeon and eventually underwent laparoscopic repair of the diaphragmatic hernia with mesh repair. In follow-up, the patient's symptoms resolved."
