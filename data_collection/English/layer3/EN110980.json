  "text": "A 19-year-old man experienced severe dyspnoea. The cardiac biomarkers troponin T and NT-proBNP were elevated, and transthoracic echocardiography showed basal hypokinesia. The man was diagnosed with stress cardiomyopathy after main differential diagnoses such as acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, and pheochromocytoma were excluded. Furthermore, the patient reported vertigo and paraesthesia. Brain and spinal MRI revealed T2-hyperintense lesions with a prominent acute lesion in the pontomedullary area. Cerebrospinal fluid findings revealed a lymphocytic pleocytosis and intrathecal IgG synthesis. Serum neurofilaments were elevated. The patient was diagnosed with MS, and treatment with intravenous Methylprednisolone was initiated. The brainstem lesion due to multiple sclerosis was assumed to be the cause of stress cardiomyopathy. The patient fully recovered."
