  "text": "A 60-year-old male patient presented to the hospital with nephrotic syndrome, renal insufficiency, hypertension and lymphadenopathy. The investigations led to the diagnosis of Waldenstr√∂m's Macroglobulinemia with associated nephrotic syndrome and chronic kidney disease due to an unusual form of hypocomplementemic glomerulopathy with histopathological features similar to those seen in mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis type III, but lacking proliferative changes."
