  "text": "In the present article, we report a Chinese patient (a 8-month-old male) who presented cyanosis when cried and heart murmur. The cardiac angiography confirmed coronary artery fistula between single coronary artery arising from the right aortic sinus and right pulmonary artery. Furthermore, the right pulmonary artery was interrupted with main pulmonary artery and the pulmonary blood supplied by single right coronary artery. Following the surgical procedure, the anomalous fistula vessel was cut and sutured. The right pulmonary artery was reconstructed to connect with main pulmonary artery. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and discharged. Then we reviewed the related literature with Medline and Pubmed databases for further details."
