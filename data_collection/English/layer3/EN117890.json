  "text": "A 52-year-old Caucasian woman presenting with features consistent with POEMS syndrome developed progressive renal impairment with proteinuria. Renal biopsy revealed a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. She was treated with relatively low dose oral mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone which stabilised her nephropathy and neuropathy."
