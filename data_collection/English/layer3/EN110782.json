  "text": "A 65-year-old man presented with a two-day history of progressive painful swelling and bluish-purple discoloration of the second and fourth toes of his left foot and new-onset AF. Tests for hypercoagulability disorders were negative. Duplex ultrasound and CT angiography excluded deep venous thrombosis and an absence of embolus, thrombus, or occlusion in the arterial tree in the lower extremities bilaterally, so BTS was diagnosed. While transthoracic echocardiography and chest CT initially showed no cardiac abnormalities or mural thrombus, subsequent transesophageal echocardiography revealed a LASP with an associated pedunculated thrombus. The affected toes were amputated due to wet gangrene, but the patient recovered well with thrombus resolution after anticoagulation."
