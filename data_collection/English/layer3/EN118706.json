  "text": "This is a report of an extremely rare orocervical foetus-in-foetu with grotesque oddity diagnosed on prenatal ultrasonography at 35 weeks gestational age in a 28-year-old, G2P1+0, Nigerian woman who was unsure of her last menstrual date or month. The included foetus had two eyes, cranium, nose, long bones and a spine. The mother's attempts at vaginal delivery rather than the elective Caesarean delivery she was offered resulted in obstructed labour and intrauterine foetal demise."
