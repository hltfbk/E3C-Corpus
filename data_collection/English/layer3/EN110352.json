  "text": "A 40 year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with low back pain. She was known of having type 1 neurofibromatosis. There was no history of trauma. The neurological examination was normal. MRI of the cervico-thoraco-lumbar spine showed an enlargement of dural sac and root sheaths, extended about 16 centimeter from D2 to D7, thus responsible of foramens enlargement and posterior vertebral scalloping. There was an extra-foraminal extension from D3 to D4 providing a dorsal anterior-meningocele. There was no abnomal medullary signal."
