  "text": "We present a case of recurrent hip dislocation in a 70-year-old female post total hip arthroplasty for which a cemented dual mobility (DM) component was used. The cemented socket dissociated from the acetabular cavity with the polyethylene liner insitul-year post- surgery. It was not related to intraprosthetic dislocation as the acetabular liner-socket interface was not disrupted. A re-revision of the acetabular component was done with an acetabular reinforcement cage, cemented cup, and constraint acetabular liner. No such case of cup dissociation has been reported in the literature till date."
