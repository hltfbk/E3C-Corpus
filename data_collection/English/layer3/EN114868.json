  "text": "An 18-year old Syrian female patient presented with bilateral gradual loss of vision since early childhood, with recent deterioration in her left eye. She appeared to have an asymmetric bilateral coat's like vasculopathy which was more severe in the left eye. The diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis was suggested, and a genetic CRB1 sequencing for the patient and her two younger siblings, who also had severe vision loss, was done, upon which the diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis associated with exudative retinal detachment due to coat's like vasculopathy was made. Treatment with panretinal photocoagulation was attempted in the worse left eye, but with no improvement. As the disease suddenly progressed in both eyes, pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser and silicone oil tamponade was performed in the better right eye which led to anatomical stabilization of the case without improvement in the visual acuity."
