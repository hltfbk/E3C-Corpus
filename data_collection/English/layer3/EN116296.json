  "text": "A 73-year-old Japanese woman presented with transient left hemiparesis and vertigo. Magnetic resonance angiography seemed to indicate two stenotic lesions distal to the right internal carotid artery in addition to the origin of the right internal carotid artery, and angiography indicated tandem stenotic lesions of the internal carotid artery. The patient was successfully treated with right carotid endarterectomy, including the distal stenotic lesion of internal carotid artery, and postoperative angiography indicated that the occipital artery arose from the internal carotid artery."
