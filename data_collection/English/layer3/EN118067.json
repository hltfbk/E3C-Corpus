  "text": "A 33-year-old previously healthy Caucasian woman presented with complaints of episodic burning pain and flushing occurring in a central distribution involving her face, ears, upper chest and, occasionally, her upper extremities. Her symptoms were triggered by lying down or warm temperature exposure and were relieved by cooling measures. Extensive diagnostic work-up looking for secondary causes for the symptoms was negative and the diagnosis of erythromelalgia was made based on details provided in her clinical history supported by raised temperature in the affected area measured by thermography during a symptomatic episode. The patient did not respond to pharmacological therapy or surgical sympathectomy. She was advised on lifestyle modification to avoid activities which triggered her symptoms. She was hypothermic with a core temperature between 92 and 95 degrees F. She also had premature ovarian failure, which had not previously been reported."
