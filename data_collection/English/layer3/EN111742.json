  "text": "A 61-year-old woman presented with moderate proteinuria with normal renal function. She was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy combined with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance after the first renal biopsy. Although having received immunosuppressive treatment for 3 years, the patient developed nephrotic syndrome. Repeated renal biopsy and laser microdissection/mass spectrometry analysis confirmed heavy chain amyloidosis. After nine cycles of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, she achieved very good partial hematological and kidney responses."
