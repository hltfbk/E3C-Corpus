  "text": "A 17-year-old male patient sought care reporting pain on the right TMJ region and mastication difficulty due to a severe limitation of mouth opening. In the clinic and imaging examinations, a 15 mm mouth opening and BMC associated with ankylotic mass of the right TMJ were observed, besides a facial asymmetry with chin deviation to the right. The proposed treatment plan was condylectomy on the right side, bilateral coronectomy, and genioplasty, so the chin lateral deviation could be corrected, under general anesthesia. The patient remains under clinical and imaging follow-up of two years with functional stability and no signs of relapse of the ankylosis."
