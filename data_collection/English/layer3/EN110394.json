  "text": "A 31 year old woman presented with left-sided nasal obstruction and pressure pain in the left maxillary sinus and forehead for six months. She was diagnosed four years ago with sarcoidosis with involvement of the lungs and liver, hilar lymphadenopathy, as well as iritis. CT of the PNS showed typical signs of chronic left maxillary, anterior ethmoidal, and frontal sinusitis. Since conservative topical therapy with cortisone had failed, the patient was treated surgically with functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). Histology revealed mucosal granulation with sarcoidosis involvement. The endoscopic follow-up six months after the operation showed no recurrence. After the initial healing phase, the patient reported significant improvement of all symptoms."
