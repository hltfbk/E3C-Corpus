  "text": "A healthy 24-year-old women received a Calcium Hydroxylapatite filler injection to her nose bridge for the correction of nose asymmetry 8Â years post rhinoplasty. She developed sudden right eye ocular pain and visual disturbances. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes and visual field in the right eye showed inferior arch with fixation sparing and supero-temporal central scotoma. Examination revealed marked periorbital edema and hematoma, ptosis, ocular movements limitation, an infero-temporal branch retinal artery occlusion and multiple choroidal emboli. Eighteen months post initial presentation ptosis and eye movements returned normal and choroidal emboli absorbed almost completely. However, visual acuity declined to 20/60, visual field showed severe progressive deterioration with a central and supero-nasal field remnant and the optic disc became pallor."
