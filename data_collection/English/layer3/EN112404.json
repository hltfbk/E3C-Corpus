  "text": "We present a case of a patent omphalomesenteric duct with ileal prolapse and ileal rupture as its complication. It is a case of a 1-year-old infant with a history of unusual bleed-on-touch mass emerging from the anterior abdominal wall with absent umbilicus. Once his condition is stabilised, he underwent a reduction of the prolapsed bowel along with complete excision of the omphalomesenteric duct and restoration of the ileal continuity. Post-operatively he regained normal bowel function and resumed breastfeeding 5 days after surgery."
