  "text": "A 20-year-old Tunisian male patient with a past medical history of appendectomy and ileocecal Crohn's disease, presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. He was admitted to the gastroenterology department for clinical check-up. On physical examination, the patient was skinny and pale. Palpation of the left iliac fossa and hypogastrium was painful. He underwent ileocolonoscopy which showed an ulcerated and congested appearance of the upper rectum and sigmoid. Computed tomography scan showed a circumferential thickening of the terminal ileum with luminal stenosis and dilated intestine upstream. Several mesenteric lymphadenopathies were also identified. A fistula between abdominal cavity and skin was disclosed. Stage 2 bilateral sacro-iliitis was objectified on pelvic CT scan. Upper endoscopy was within normal limits. Histological examination of the biopsy specimens of the upper rectum and sigmoid revealed a focally ulcerated colonic epithelium. The lamina propria was fibrous harbouring a polymorphic inflammatory infiltrate including lymphocytes and plasma cells organized in lymphoid follicles admixed with eosinophils and neutrophils. In the submucosa, two well-preserved schistosoma eggs surrounded by a thick shell with a barely visible terminal spine were identified. The final pathological diagnosis was colonic schistosomiasis associated with Crohn's disease. The patient underwent an ileocecal resection for stenosis of the terminal ileum complicated with enterocutaneous fistula. The postoperative course was uneventful. A stool examination and serology tests were planned for this patient who was lost to follow-up."
