  "text": "During routine dissection classes for undergraduate medical students, we encountered a variation in the azygos venous system in a 65 years old south Indian male cadaver. We observed that there was no accessory azygos vein, and left 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th posterior intercostal veins terminated directly into azygos vein."
