  "text": "A 54-year-old female patient referred to the hematology clinic with fatigue and nosebleed. She had a history of type-2 diabetes mellitus and breast cancer. The patient was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago and underwent a mastectomy followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and she has been receiving tamoxifen since that time. The chemotherapy protocol was inaccessible because the chemotherapy was administered in Syria. The physical examination revealed a swollen right arm, ecchymoses in arms, and fixed, firm, painless cervical lymphadenopathies, the largest of which was 2x2cm in size and located on the right. Laboratory parameters were as follows: white blood cell count: 3.62 x 10 9 /L with 0.84x10 9 /L neutrophils, hemoglobin: 11 g/dL, platelet count: 10x10 9 /L. Biochemical, liver and renal function test results were normal. HBsAg, Anti-HBS, Anti-HCV and Anti-HIV test results were negative. Platelet count by peripheral smear was compatible with the hemogram count without any atypical cells. The lymph node biopsy could not be performed since the platelet count did not rise despite transfusion. Instead, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed for diagnostic purposes. The biopsy finding was compatible with CD20 positive high-grade B cell lymphoma resembling diffuse large B cell lymphoma). Body 18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18 F-FDG PET/CT) performed for staging revealed following lymphadenopathies: 1.3x0.8cm-sized at the right parotid gland inferior (SUVmax: 11.8), right inferior jugular area (SUVmax: 13.1), and 2x1.5 cm-sized (largest) (SUVmax: 6.8) in the right deep cervical location. The patient started to receive a chemotherapy protocol combining rituximab-cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisolone (R-CHOP). Her hemogram values displayed an improvement after the second cycle. However, interim PET-BT, performed after the fourth cycle, showed an incomplete response in cervical lymphatic nodes. Then, a tru-cut biopsy was performed from the lymph node in the neck as blood values were better. The patient continued to receive R-CHOP until the biopsy result was obtained. R-CHOP was stopped at the sixth cycle. The lymph node biopsy result showed breast cancer metastasis). She underwent a bone marrow biopsy after six cycles of R-CHOP, which revealed that the lymphoma infiltration disappeared. The patient's breast cancer treatment continues."
