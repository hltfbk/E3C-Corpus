  "text": "The patient was a 23-year-old man who developed progressively worse headaches and papilledema. The HPC was located entirely inside the confluence of the sinuses (CoS) and resulted in venous sinus occlusion. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a dAVF located in the straight sinus, upstream of the occluded CoS, which was fed by the dural branch of the posterior cerebral artery. After the endovascular embolization of the tumor feeders, subsequent surgery included venous reconstruction in addition to tumor excision. Although the dAVF was not treated with an endovascular procedure or surgery, postoperative angiography revealed complete disappearance of the dAVF."
