  "text": "Here, we report a 4-year-old Chinese boy who presented with MAE, delayed language, borderline intellectual disability (ID), mildly impaired social skills and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He also had mild aortic valve stenosis and high myopia. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES), we identified three variants: (1) SLC6A1, NM_003042.4: c.881-883del (p.Phe294del), (2) NOTCH1, NM_017617.5:c.1100-2A > G and (3) PRIMPOL, NM_152683.4:c.265 T > G (p.Tyr89Asp). Parental Sanger sequencing confirmed that SLC6A1 and NOTCH1 variants were de novo, whereas the PRIMPOL variant was inherited from the father who also had high myopia. Furthermore, the PRIMPOL variant was absent from the genomes of the paternal grandparents, and thus was also a de novo event in the family. All three variants are classified as pathogenic."
