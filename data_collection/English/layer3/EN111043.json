  "text": "A 66-year-old Chinese man with lung cancer was admitted to the hospital, complaining of a cough and expectoration for five months and fever for two months. After a series of inspections to differentiate a cancer-related fever from an infectious fever, he was diagnosed with lung abscess. Draining pus culture demonstrated Eikenella corrodens and Streptococcus anginosus. After more than 1â€‰month of antibiotic therapy and draining in total, he gradually recovered to fight against lung cancer."
