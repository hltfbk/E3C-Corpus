  "text": "A 75-year-old Asian male with bilateral phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation developed severe inflammation with sharp vision loss in both eyes after the surgeries. Physical examination indicated bilateral panuveitis. With a presumptive diagnosis of suppurative endophthalmitis and a history of effective treatment with intravenous antibiotics plus ofloxacin and steroid drops, intravenous ceftazidime and vancomycin were administered. However, the effects were minimal. With a supplemental history of recurrent oral, perineal, and gastrointestinal ulcers, a diagnosis of Behcet's disease was made, and systemic immune inhibitors were prescribed instead of invasive treatments, which might exacerbate the condition. After 5 days of medication, the inflammation was markedly relieved, and no recurrence was observed 2 weeks later."
