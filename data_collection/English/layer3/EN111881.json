  "text": "We present three unrelated cases of MOPD II with similar facial features and short stature. Unlike the cases described in the literature, all subjects had normal birth weight and height but their growth was retarded thereafter. In addition to delayed milestones, they have a broad forehead, maxillary protrusion, long peaked nose, high nasal bridge, low-set large ears, extreme reromicrogenia, and normal-sized teeth. These three patients had similar ocular manifestations with the short axial length associated with high hyperopia more than + 9 diopters (D) and macular scarring. The oldest subject was a 20 year-old male without neurological symptoms. One female subject had developed alopecia during the previous 2 years. The other female subject had moyamoya disease, but a genetic study revealed a normal PCNT gene."
