  "text": "A 33-year-old woman presented an incidental 3.7 × 3.3-mm unruptured cerebral aneurysm (CAn) in her basilar artery, which was successfully coiled with balloon assistance. A follow-up brain MRI at 1 and 2 months showed a gradual increase in several white matter hyperintense lesions in the left cerebellar, bilateral occipitotemporal and left parietoccipital lobe during fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). These were the only lesions associated with perfused CAn. However, the patient did not show any additional symptoms such as visual disturbance throughout the entire course. (11)C-methionine-PET (MET-PET) showed an obvious increase in methionine uptake in the lesion corresponding to enhanced areas with gadolinium-enhanced MRI. MRS showed a decrease in the N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/cr) ratio and a slight elevation of the choline/creatine (cho/cr) ratio and a lactate peak in the lesion. A follow-up MRI at 6 and 12 months showed a gradual decrease in the initial hyperintense lesions in FLAIR without any treatment."
