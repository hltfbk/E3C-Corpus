  "text": "A 7.5-month-old female infant weighing 7200 gm was operated on for liver transplantation. The patient suffered jaundice at one month of age and was diagnosed with neonatal colestatic hepatitis. After routine monitoring, via indirect technique, central catheterization was attempted through internal jugular vein. However, the attempt failed. Therefore, again via indirect technique, catheterization was achieved through the right subclavian vein and fixed at 8 cm. After the operation started, fluid replacement and central venous pressure monitoring were performed with this catheter. Immediately after the operation, a control postero-anterior chest radiograph of the patient was obtained. This graph revealed that the tip of the catheter was fixed in the right internal jugular vein. Since the vital symptoms of the patient were not stable, the catheter was not removed and fluid replacement was performed via this technique. The catheter was removed on the postoperative 2(nd) day."
