  "text": "A 65 year old man presented with a left lower abdominal mass of two years duration. His bowel habits were normal. He had an uneventful trans-vescical prostatectomy about 8 years prior to presentation. Examination revealed a non tender mass in the left lower abdomen. Mass was more mobile in the transverse plane and tympanitic. Rectal examination was normal. Double contrast barium enema and CT scan suggested a giant sigmoid diverticulum.\nLaparotomy revealed a bi-lobed giant diverticulum located in the lower sigmoid colon. It was inseparably adhered (but not communicating) to the medial side of the caecum and to the superior surface of the urinary bladder. There were few discrete paracolic nodes adjacent to the diverticulum. The proximal sigmoid colon and the rectum appeared normal. Diverticulectomy with a Hartmann's procedure was done. Dense adhesions between the diverticulum and the caecum necessitated a limited right hemi colectomy with ileo-colic anastomosis. Recovery was uneventful and he was discharged ten days post operation. Histology revealed no features of malignancy."
