  "text": "We report a 40-year-old Chinese male who had severe neck pain and difficult neck movement after falling from 3 meters. X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an axis injury consisting of an odontoid Type III fracture associated with a Hangman fracture categorized as a Levine-Edwards Type I fracture. The patient underwent anterior odontoid screw fixation and posterior percutaneous screw fixation using intraoperative O-arm navigation. Neck pain was markedly improved after surgery. X-rays and CT scan reconstructions of 3-mo follow-up showed good stability and fusion. The range of cervical motion was well preserved."
