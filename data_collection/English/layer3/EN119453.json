  "text": "We describe a hepatocellular carcinoma with concomitant splenic marginal zone lymphoma in a 64-year-old Chinese man with cirrhosis. Serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen was positive and antihepatitis C virus antibody was negative. The resected liver mass measuring 4 x 3 x 3 cm was grey and soft with a small area of bleeding, necrosis and intact capsule. Cut surface of the spleen was red-purple and had a diffuse reticulonodular appearance indicative of prominent white pulp. On histologic sections, the liver mass was well and moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, and the splenic tumor was a specific low-grade small B-cell lymphoma. Immunohistochemical staining and gene rearrangement studies supported that the splenic tumor represents a clonal B-cell lymphoma. Therefore, the diagnosis of SMZL was made from the splenic specimen."
