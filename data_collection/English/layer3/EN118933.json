  "text": "We report a case of a 50-year-old man with epigastric pain and haematemesis. 28 years ago he had undergone partial gastrectomy and gastroenterostomy for benign gastric ulcer. An Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a possible bleeding vessel on the anterior wall lesser curve of the stomach. The lesion was injected with adrenaline 1 in 100,000. In spite of the intervention he continued to have haemetemesis with significant haemodynamic impairment. At exploratory laparotomy, an oedematous ridge on the posterior wall with a bleeding point on the posterior gastric wall. Histology showed features consistent with gastritis cystica profunda. He made an excellent post-operative recovery."
