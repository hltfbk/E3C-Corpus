  "text": "A previously healthy 63-year-old man was admitted with sloughy necrotic ulcerations of the skin over his sternum. He was afebrile and in good condition. A skin biopsy revealed ecthyma gangrenosum. Blood cultures remained sterile, but a culture of biopsy material grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa."
