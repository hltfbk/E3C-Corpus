  "text": "A 52-year-old female patient was admitted to the authors' department with inability to weight bear. Because of bilateral developmental hip dysplasia (Type II, Hartofilakidis classification) she underwent THA bilaterally at another institution about 20 years ago. On admission, the initial plain roentgenogram of the hip was impressive, disclosing sclerotic, osteolytic lesions, associated with perforation of the lateral and medial cortices of the proximal femur, and migration to 90-degree horizontal position on the frontal plane of the whole prosthesis. Based on the preoperative planning, the implants were removed through a small medial longitudinal approach accompanied with lateral debridement. The patient denied revision surgery and the final result was a resection arthroplasty."
