  "text": "A 73-year-old woman suffered for 1.5 years from gait disturbance and disorientation that were suspicious of dementia. A brain MRI revealed that her symptoms were likely due to dAVF. An angiography provided a definitive diagnosis of dural transverse-sigmoid sinus fistula. Transvenous embolization completely occluded the fistula and led to a significant improvement of her cognitive function in tandem with a restoration of the cerebral blood flow."
