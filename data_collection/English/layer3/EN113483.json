  "text": "The patient in this case was a boy born at 31 weeks of gestation with a weight of 882 g (< 3rd percentile) to non-consanguineous parents. Genital examination showed micropenis and bilateral cryptorchidism. On the third day of life, he manifested hypotension with high urine output, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypernatriuria, high plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone level, and high plasma renin activity, suggesting acute adrenal insufficiency. The serum 17α-hydroxyprogesterone level was normal. Adrenal insufficiency improved following administration of hydrocortisone and 9α-fludrocortisone, but the patient died of recurrent infection at 4 months of age. He was suspected as IMAGE (Intrauterine growth restriction, Metaphyseal dysplasia, Adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and Genital anomalies) syndrome. However, no mutation in CDKN1C was identified. Targeted exome sequencing using the TruSight One Sequencing Panel (Illumina) identified a heterozygous mutation of c.2944C > T (p.R982C) in exon 3 in SAMD9."
