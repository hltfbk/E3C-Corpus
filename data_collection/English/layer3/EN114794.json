  "text": "We present a case of a 12-year-old boy presented to us with minor trauma to right ankle associated with swelling, pain and had associated cough, and fever. On investigation with plain X-ray of right ankle/chest, and blood parameters, patient was suspected of having cellulitis of right leg with chest infection. Patient was treated with IV Cloxacillin and ample of rest. During the course of treatment, patient's condition deteriorated with fever, tachycardia and a swollen leg without much pain. Duplex scan was performed where the right leg revealed thrombosis of popliteal vein, while CT scan of chest with angiogram ruled out possibility of pulmonary embolism. However, CT chest showed pneumonia with pulmonary effusion. Patient was treated with low molecular heparin and IV Cloxacillin for pneumonia. Patient recovered completely and there was no recurrence during follow up period of 6 months."
