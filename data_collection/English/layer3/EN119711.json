  "text": "A patient was referred for surgical treatment for a tumor in retro-peritoneal space. The computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass originating from the left adrenal gland. The patient underwent left adrenalectomy and the exploration of abdominal cavity did not reveal any other palpable lesions. Histologically, the resected lesion was a poorly differentiated metastatic tumor from HCC. Seven months later patient was readmitted complaining of cachexia, icterus, and significant weight loss. CT scan revealed hyperdense lesions of the liver."
