  "text": "A 78-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our department with right flank pain, pyrexia and features of a urinary tract infection. A nephrostogram revealed a grossly distended right pelvicalyceal system in a pelvi-ureteric junction obstruction pattern. She underwent an elective pyeloplasty after her acute management and the results of histological examination revealed mantle cell lymphoma."
