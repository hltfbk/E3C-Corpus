  "text": "A 48-year-old Chinese woman developed blurred vision after 9Â months of topiramate use. Her visual acuity dropped from 1.2 to 0.7 in both eyes, with bilateral diffuse pigmentary retinopathy and a constricted visual field. Despite an improvement in visual acuity after cessation of the drug, the other clinical findings remained. The temporal relationship between the initiation of topiramate and the visual disturbance suggests that topiramate could be the cause of such signs and symptoms."
