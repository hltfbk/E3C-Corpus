  "text": "We present the algorithm for surgical treatment and correction of complications in a 38-year-old male with bilateral giant bullae (vanishing lung syndrome), severe COPD. Primarily the patient was admitted with a mild cough, mucopurulent sputum and dyspnea. A CT scan revealed bilateral giant bullae, displacing up to 50% of lung volume. A two-stage surgical bullectomy was planned, yet postoperative complications due to secondary bullae rupture prompted urgent revision with contralateral bullae resection. After complete bullectomy, severely reduced lung volume was successfully managed throughout a long postoperative rehabilitation period. At 5â€‰year follow-up, spirometry indicators and radiological examination show significantly improved and stable lung function."
