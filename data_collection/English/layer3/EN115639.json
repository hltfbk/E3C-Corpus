  "text": "A 63-year-old Caucasian male presented with acute liver injury of unknown origin. After excluding the most prevalent causes of acute liver injury, liver histology revealed signs of immune-mediated toxic or drug-induced liver injury. Therefore, immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone was started. After initialization of steroid treatment, polymerase chain reaction analyses of peripheral blood and liver tissue revealed an acute hepatitis E virus infection (genotype 3). Under sustained steroid treatment, acute liver injury improved and hepatitis E infection resolved."
