  "text": "A 31-years-old paraplegic male suffered a subtrochanteric femur fracture as an innocuous injury during his physiotherapy and range of motion (ROM) exercises. He had osteopenia that resulted in this fragility fracture. He was managed with an intramedullary nail, and medical management was done for osteopenia."
