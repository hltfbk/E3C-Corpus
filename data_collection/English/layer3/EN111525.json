  "text": "A 43-year-old man was referred because of an intermittent typical chest pain. The patient had no cardiovascular risk factor, and was not on any medication; laboratory tests showed elevated and raising troponin I. The first ECG showed pre-excitation (WPW) as well as de winter pattern. According to patient's symptoms and suggestive ECG for probable left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion, emergent angiography was scheduled. The coronary angiography revealed sever LAD artery occlusion. The patient was symptom free after successful percutaneous coronary intervention, and was discharged on medication. The patient remained asymptomatic in 1-year follow-up period."
