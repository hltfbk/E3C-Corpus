  "text": "Here we are reporting a case of complete separation of the proximal epiphysis of the femur in a 2 year old female child. She was treated by open reduction and internal fixation by a single k-wire of proximal femoral epiphysis. Regular follow up showed fusion of proximal femoral epiphysis at about 3 months of post operative period. After 8 months of follow up she can stand and walk without support. Long term outcome is awaited."
