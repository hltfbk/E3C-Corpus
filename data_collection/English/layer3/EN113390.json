  "text": "A 41-year-old Japanese woman presenting with severe visual loss in the left eye was examined and observed to have had full thickness corneal perforation as well as a Descemet membrane rupture with massive edema in the corneal stroma. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography-based corneal topography revealed a distorted crab claw sign indicating pellucid marginal corneal degeneration. The Descemet membrane rupture allowed acute hydrops to occur which was especially noteworthy given the scale of edema present within the stroma, rotating 180 degrees along the limbus, causing a smiley-face like lesion. We visualized it via a gonioscopic three-dimensional optical coherence tomography to build a three-dimensional video. Patient history revealed a previous acute hydrops in the right eye as well, which was ultimately treated with anterior lamellar keratoplasty, suggesting the pellucid marginal corneal degeneration had a classic bilateral involvement, which was also characterized with bilateral acute hydrops."
