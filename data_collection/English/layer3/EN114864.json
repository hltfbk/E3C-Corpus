  "text": "A 43-year-old Bangladeshi gentleman, known diabetic, hypertensive, smoker, presented with the complaints of recurrent episodes of low to high grade intermittent fever, productive cough with occasional haemoptysis and 10Â kg weight loss over one and half months. Poorly responding to conventional antibiotics, he was suspected as a case of pulmonary tuberculosis. Examination and investigations revealed left sided consolidation with cavitary lesion, hepato-splenomegaly and sputum analysis confirmed growth of Burkholderia pseudomallei. The patient was successfully treated as a case of primary melioidosis pneumonia."
