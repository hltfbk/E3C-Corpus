  "text": "A 47-year-old Asian Caucasian woman presented with a painless swelling at the right lateral border of the tongue with an intact overlying mucosa. There were no other associated complaints. The lesion was excised and subjected to histopathological examination that revealed an interesting and unusual morphology of polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma."
