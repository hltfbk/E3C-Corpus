  "text": "We describe the cases of two patients with thyroid carcinoma presenting with neuromuscular symptoms due to large skeletal metastases in the shoulder and sternum respectively. Pre-operative percutaneous selective catheterizations of the arteries feeding the metastatic tumors were performed, followed by infusion of gelfoam. The procedures were technically successful in both patients without adverse effects or bleeding. Complete resections of the skeletal metastases were then performed without substantial bleeding."
