  "text": "Here we report a case of a 75-year-old man with liver metastasis at 3 years after a successful transverse colectomy to treat KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer. While initial administration of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors proved effective, continued use of the same treatment resulted in new peritoneal seeding. An acquired KRAS mutation was found in a resected tissue specimen from one such area. This mutation, possibly caused by administration of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, appears to have conferred drug resistance."
