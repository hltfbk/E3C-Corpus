  "text": "The authors report the case of a seventy-eight year-old woman with a polycystic variant of a solitary primary intracranial leptomeningeal astrocytoma. The first neurological signs were seizures and aphasia. CT and MRI scans demonstrated a fronto-parietal polycystic tumor adherent to the sub arachnoid space. A left fronto-temporo-parietal craniotomy revealed a tight coalescence between the tumor and the arachnoid layer which appeared to wrap the mass entirely. Removal of the deeper solid part of the tumor resulted difficult due to the presence of both a high vascularity and a tight adherence between the tumor and the ventricular wall."
