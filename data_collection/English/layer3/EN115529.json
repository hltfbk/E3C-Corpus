  "text": "A twenty eight year old gentleman admitted to our hospital with history of continuous bleeding from surgical site over left heel since three months. About six months ago he was evaluated elsewhere for a painful progressive lesion in the left calcaneum. Following which he underwent curettage of lesion with bone grafting. One month after this he was re-operated for recurrence with curettage with bone cementing. Curetted material on both occasions was reported as aneurysmal bone cyst. One month following the second surgery, surgical scar over the outer aspect of left heel opened out and started to bleed continuously. X rays and MRI done before surgical treatment were suggestive of aneurysmal bone cyst Investigations for clotting and bleeding disorders were normal. The granulation tissue from the floor of the cavity was curetted and sent for histopathology, which was reported as angiosarcoma."
