  "text": "A 79-year-old Caucasian woman was treated at our hospital for right atrial myeloma localization. Our patient showed the following signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure: dyspnea, hypotension, cyanosis and facial edema. Surgery was not considered feasible due to the extent of the disease. Our patient underwent external-beam radiation therapy using an intensity modulated technique, thus obtaining a persistent complete remission. Our patient has been in continuous complete local remission for 25 months since the end of radiotherapy."
