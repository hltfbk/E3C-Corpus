  "text": "Here we report the case of a 41-year-old Korean woman who developed chest pain after indirect revascularization surgery of moyamoya disease. A treadmill test and an exercise stress echocardiograph showed positive results, but there was no significant major coronary arteries stenosis. Suspicious of vasospasm, we conducted an ergonovine spasm stimulation test, which demonstrated tight stenosis of her proximal left anterior descending artery. At the site of spasm, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology showed intraluminal fibrous plaque."
