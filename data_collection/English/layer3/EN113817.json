  "text": "We report the case of a 70-year-old female with knee osteoarthritis presenting with a high level of knee pain, scoring 8 on the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), and functional limitation demonstrating a poor Lysholm Knee Score of 37. MRI scans of the knee revealed subchondral BML in the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau. The patient was administered a course of Pentosan Polysulphate Sodium (PPS) intramuscularly twice weekly, for 3 weeks. MRI scans 2 weeks post-treatment showed complete resolution of the bone marrow edema at the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau with concomitant recovery from pain (NRS pain score of 0), and a 43% improvement of the Lysholm Knee Score. In addition, marked reduction in joint effusion was also demonstrated in the MRI scan post PPS therapy."
