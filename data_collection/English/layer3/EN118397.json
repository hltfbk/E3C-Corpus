  "text": "A 77-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital because of epigastric pain. A solitary mass with delayed enhancement by dynamic computed tomography was present in the left hepatic lobe. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed only segmental stenosis of the left intrahepatic bile duct. No abnormal findings were detected in the pancreas. The patient was clinically diagnosed as having intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and underwent surgery. Histological examination of the hepatic mass and bile duct wall showed abundant IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltration with obliterative phlebitis. The final diagnosis was IgG4-related hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor with sclerosing cholangitis. Delayed enhancement by computed tomography is a characteristic feature of IgG4-related inflammatory pseudotumor similar to that of autoimmune pancreatitis."
