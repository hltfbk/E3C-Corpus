  "text": "A 50-year-old Hispanic man referred severe psychomotor symptoms, described as anxiety, aggressiveness, agitation, weakness, diaphoresis, and decreased visual acuity. Laboratory testing performed during his last episode revealed increased insulin levels and C-peptide among other findings. Imaging, biopsy, and histopathologic analysis confirmed an insulinoma was the cause of the symptoms, proving the importance of ruling out organic causes of altered mental status prior to consideration of psychiatric disorders."
