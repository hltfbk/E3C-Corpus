  "text": "We describe a male of Italian descent born at 35 weeks by elective caesarean delivery presenting hypoplastic left colon, bilateral inguinal hernia, dysplastic tricuspid and pulmonary valves, premature ventricular contractions, recurrent otitis media, poor feeding, gastro-oesophageal reflux, bilateral pseudopapilledema, and astigmatism. He also showed particular facial dysmorphisms and postnatal growth failure. Early psychomotor development was mildly delayed. At 3.75 years, he was evaluated for severe short stature (-2.98 SD) and delayed bone age. He showed an insulin-like growth factor 1 concentration (IGF-1) in the low-normal range. Growth hormone stimulation tests showed a low response to clonidine and insulin. Magnetic resonance imaging showed hypophyseal hypoplasia. Genetic evaluation by Single Nucleotide Polymorphism arrays showed a de novo 6q24.2-q25.2 deletion on paternal chromosome 6."
