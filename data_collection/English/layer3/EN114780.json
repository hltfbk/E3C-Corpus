  "text": "A 48Â year-old male experienced prolonged and unexplained reduced athletic performance worsening over five years. The patient reported decreased libido, which initiated a testosterone blood test. This confirmed reduced testosterone levels and resulted in an endocrinology referral. A subsequent dynamic contrast MRI of the pituitary region revealed a mass. The most frequent symptoms of NFPA are visual field defects, headaches and features of hypopituitarism (includes fatigue, dizziness, dry skin, irregular periods in women and sexual dysfunction in men)."
