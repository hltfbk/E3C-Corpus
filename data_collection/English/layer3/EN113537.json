  "text": "We targeted two consecutive VSP patients who underwent this procedure. It took an average of 1 day from the onset of VSP to surgery. We performed double patch and infarct exclusion for VSP using bovine pericardium via an LV incision. Two patches were marked with a skin pen to anastomose eight mattresses equally. In addition, a one piece-coupled patch was made for infarct exclusion. The two patients were extubated on the day after surgery and intra-aortic balloon pump assistance was also withdrawn. Without perioperative complications, they could leave the intensive care unit after 6.5 days on average. Early postoperative ECG and magnetic resonance angiography showed good LV wall contraction, except at the infarcted area, with no evidence of a residual shunt."
