  "text": "A 71-year-old male with unrecognizable malignancy developed a hemispheric ischemic stroke and received intra-venous tPA within 4.5 h of onset, followed by anticoagulation treatment after 24 h of throm-bolysis. Two days later, the patient had tarry stool and progressive anemia, receiving a blood transfusion. The systemic workup documented the presence of double primary cancers with advanced stage gastric and rectal cancers, and the patient subsequently received palliative care. The outcome at 3 months was a modified Rankin Scale of 5, and the patient died 6 months after the stroke."
