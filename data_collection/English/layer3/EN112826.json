  "text": "We present a case of 42-year-old male elsewhere diagnosed as pyogenic arthritis of left elbow and treated by incisional drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics, who presented to us 6 months later with multiple non-healing actively discharging sinuses. The repeat radiographs and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) were reported as chronic osteomyelitis of proximal radius without the involvement of humerus and ulna. The excision of radial head along with sinus tracts was done for clearance of disease and excised tissues, on being subjected to Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CB-NAAT), culture and histopathological examination, the diagnosis of TB was established."
