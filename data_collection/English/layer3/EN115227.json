  "text": "We herein report three cases of primary hyperparathyroidism with an unusual presentation of brown tumors. All three patients were Asian. In the first case, a 42-year-old man was admitted with a mass mimicking a malignant bone neoplasm in the right mandible as the first manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism. The second case involved a 25-year-old man admitted with a fracture of his right femur. The third case involved a 43-year-old man with multiple brown tumors in both lower limbs. All three patients underwent successful parathyroidectomy for parathyroid adenomas; one case was complicated by a papillary thyroid carcinoma."
