  "text": "This is a retrospective case series of patients (January 2011 to October 2015) in whom cerclage wiring was used as an adjunct to osteosynthesis of primary and periprosthetic fractures of femur. Patient demographics, number of wires used, implant used for osteosynthesis, number of days to union, union rate and complications were recorded and analyzed. The patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. 11 patients (7 female and 4 male) with a mean age of 67.10 ± 21.64 years were studied. The number of patients with intertrochanteric, subtrochanteric, diaphyseal, and periprosthetic fractures of the femur was two, five, one, and three, respectively. Internal fixation was done with plates in six and cephalomedullary nails in five patients. Mean total number of wires used was 2.10 ± 0.70. Mean duration of follow-up was 15.91 ± 10.03 months. Union was achieved in all cases with a mean duration of 86.63 ± 22.44 days. There were no complications in our study."
