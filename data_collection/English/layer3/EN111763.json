  "text": "A 69-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to right upward abdominal pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated acute cholecystitis and cholecystolithiasis. Percutaneous gallbladder drainage was performed subsequently. He was discharged after 3 d and readmitted to hospital for cholecystectomy as arranged 1 mo later. A repeat CT scan revealed an emerging enhancing mass between the pancreatic head and the descending duodenum. Then, he suffered hematochezia and hemorrhagic shock suddenly. Emergency percutaneous angiogram was performed and selective catheterization of the superior mesenteric artery demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm in the inferior PDA. Coil embolization was performed and his clinical condition improved quickly after embolization and blood transfusion. He underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and was discharged from hospital after surgery under satisfactory conditions."
