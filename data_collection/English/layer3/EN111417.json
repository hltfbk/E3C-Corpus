  "text": "We report a case of concomitant bilateral elastofibroma in the infrascapular and gluteal regions. A 63-year-old male patient presented with a 6-month history of gradually increasing painless swellings in the upper back. On physical examination, firm, painless bilateral infrascapular masses were identified; these masses were more noticeable on forward arm flexion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed well-defined bilateral infrascapular masses deep to the serratus anterior muscles as well as poorly defined bilateral gluteal masses with attenuation similar to that of the adjacent skeletal muscle. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed heterogenous masses with internal fatty streaks, consistent with elastofibroma. The histopathological diagnosis of elastofibroma was established based on the results of image-guided core-needle biopsy. The patient underwent surgical excision of both infrascapular elastofibromas with no post-operative complications. As the gluteal masses were incidental, surgical management was not warranted."
