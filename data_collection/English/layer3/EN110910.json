  "text": "A 49-year-old man who was diagnosed with a large (16 cm) HCC in the right lobe with tumor thrombosis in the main trunk of the portal vein (PVTT) received high-dose hypofractionated PBT in another hospital. A total dose of 66 GyE in 10 fractions was administered to the primary tumor and the PVTT. After 5 months, a 1-cm solitary nodule was noted in the upper lobe of the right lung. Therefore, sorafenib was started. About 6 months after the PBT, lower esophageal mucosal inflammation that progressed to an ulcer was noted. About 7 months after the PBT, the lower esophagus developed full-thickness necrosis. Therefore, emergency thoracoscopic esophagectomy was performed, followed by two-stage reconstruction 2 months later. The operation and postoperative clinical course were mostly uneventful, except for a minor anastomotic leakage. The outcome of the primary HCC, including the PVTT, was graded as a complete response, which has been maintained for 51 months after the PBT."
