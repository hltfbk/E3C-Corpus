  "text": "We present a case of a 51-year-old male with an axillary artery injury associated with an anterior glenohumeral dislocation. The patient was initially evaluated at an outside hospital where the vascular injury was not immediately identified, and then was subsequently transferred to our institution where he underwent bypass grafting without significant sequela. Additional prophylactic fasciotomies were also performed due to concern for reperfusion compartment syndrome."
