  "text": "We report a case of a middle-aged female who presented to the Emergency Department with nonspecific symptoms. Computed tomography showed a liver abscess that had formed secondary to a fishbone. The patient was treated conservatively initially and subsequently with percutaneous drainage and finally with open drainage. Her condition improved and she was discharged from the hospital with the foreign body still in-situ."
