  "text": "A 27-year-old Japanese woman previously diagnosed with avasucular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head on the basis of radiological findings was referred to the study site for surgical management of a painful hip joint. She had no history of disease but suffered from bilateral hip joint lesions. Analysis of her pedigree revealed that bilateral hip joint lesions affected more than three generations of her family. Based on these findings, haplotype analysis of her and her family members was performed by examining select candidate genes from the critical interval for epiphyseal dysplasia of the femoral head on 12q13 and sequencing the promoter and exonic regions of COL2A1."
