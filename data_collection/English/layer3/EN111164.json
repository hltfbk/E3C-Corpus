  "text": "A 65-year-old male was referred for vitreo-retinal surgery with a provisional diagnosis of rhegmatogenous RD in his right eye. Dilated fundus examination showed an inferior bullous RD with no evidence of retinal breaks, while a large RPE tear was detected in the temporal quadrant. Ocular ultrasound showed no mass lesion. The axial length was 23.63 mm. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) revealed a pachychoroid pattern in both eyes. The patient referred a history of CSC in the right eye and the recent use of intravenous corticosteroids for bronchitis. Laser therapy and photodynamic therapy were not applicable due to the extension and elevation of the RD. Two months after oral treatment with eplerenone, the subretinal fluid increased significantly. The patient underwent two 4 × 4 mm deep lamellar sclerectomies in the inferior quadrants. The surgical treatment resulted in complete RD resolution."
