  "text": "We report a case of a 75-year-old Japanese woman who presented with black vomiting of 5 days' duration. Physical examination revealed a right inguinal bulge and sharp pain. Computed tomography revealed a right strangulated femoral hernia with no intestinal ischemia. We were able to reposition the hernia; however, we performed the operation with consideration of the possibility of intestinal ischemia by incarceration of the intestine because the onset was 5 days previously. Intraperitoneal observation revealed a right femoral hernia and confirmed that the intestinal tract was not ischemic. However, the intestinal tract was expanded because of ileus, and securing a clear field of vision was difficult. Hence, we switched to totally extraperitoneal hernia repair at the same incision and performed single-incision totally extraperitoneal hernia repair with intraperitoneal inspection. The hernia sac was observed at the femoral rings and obturator foramen. The mesh was inserted through the incision, and after it was positioned to cover the Hesselbach triangle, femoral rings, inguinal ring, and obturator foramen, it was fixed with SECURESTRAP®. Observation of the abdominal cavity confirmed complete repair. After the operation, there was no recurrence or other complications."
