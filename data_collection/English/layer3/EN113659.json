  "text": "The patient was a 55-year-old man who had been diagnosed with CLL 4Â years earlier and who had been followed up without treatment. Although his serum creatinine level had remained normal for three and a half years, it started to increase in the six months prior to his presentation. A urinalysis showed mild proteinuria without any hematuria at the time of presentation. A renal biopsy revealed the diffuse infiltration of CLL cells into the tubulointerstitial area with non-caseating epithelioid cell granulomas. Despite cyclophosphamide treatment, his renal function did not improve, and he ultimately required maintenance hemodialysis."
