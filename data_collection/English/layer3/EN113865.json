  "text": "A 45 year old female was being followed and treated for primary open angle glaucoma in our tertiary referral center. Due to failure of medical treatment in controlling the glaucoma, surgery was offered to the patient. The XEN 45 μ-fistula implant was successfully placed in both eyes and adequate intraocular pressure control was achieved for 4 months. The left eye pressure then increased and the XEN implant was found in the anterior chamber. Topical intraocular pressure lowering therapy had to be re-initiated to achieve adequate pressure control."
