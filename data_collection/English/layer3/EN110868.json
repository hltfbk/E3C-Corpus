  "text": "A 31-year-old Indo-surinamese woman with primary infertility presented at our out-patient clinic with cyclical vulvar pain. On gynecological examination, a cyst of 1 × 2 cm was found in the right gland of Bartholin. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed normal gynecological anatomy and did not reveal any contributing information. Due to the recurring pain of the cyst, surgery was scheduled. During surgery, the marsupialization of the cyst resulted in drainage of a chocolate-colored fluid. Pathological examination revealed stroma lined with non-typical columnar epithelium with hemosiderin pigments, which confirmed a diagnosis of endometriosis in the Bartholin gland."
