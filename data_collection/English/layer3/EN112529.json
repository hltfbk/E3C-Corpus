  "text": "We report the case of a 38-year-old male (an intravenous drug abuser) diagnosed with tricuspid valve IE who underwent tricuspid valve replacement. The case was complicated by multiple lung abscesses and thoracic empyema. The pathogens causing the lung abscesses and empyema were Acinetobacter baumannii complex and Candida albicans, which were different from those causing the endocarditis. After 4â€‰weeks of antibiotic treatment, chest X-ray revealed bilateral clear lung markings with only mild blunting of the right costophrenic angle."
