  "text": "We present the case of a 45-year-old man with a chronic traumatic injury of the suprascapular and axillary nerves. In addition to a surgical transfer of the lower trapezius to the infraspinatus, we included a transfer of the latissimus dorsi and teres major, with a tensor fasciaelatae graft to the supraspinatus tendon insertion, to improve the muscular strength of shoulder elevation and abduction, as well as to improve external rotation. At 24-month post-surgery, the patient had recovered 170° of shoulder elevation, 170° of abduction, and 60° of external rotation."
