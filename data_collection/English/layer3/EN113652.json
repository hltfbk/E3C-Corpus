  "text": "An elderly patient presented to medical attention with symptoms of acute diverticulitis. On abdominal computed tomography, a massively enlarged right atrial appendage aneurysm was discovered incidentally. The aneurysm caused marked compression of the right ventricle and contained an area of hypoenhancement concerning for an intraluminal thrombus. Gadolinium-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed and first-pass perfusion images demonstrated that the area of hypoenhancement was in fact poorly mixing blood. The patient was therefore managed medically."
