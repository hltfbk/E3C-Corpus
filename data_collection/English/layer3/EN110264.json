  "text": "A 45-year-old woman was unable to urinate for the last 24 hours admitted to our clinic with no history of drug addiction, surgery, medication or allergy on her anamnesis.\nPelvic examination revealed hyperemic periurethral ulcerated protruded vulvar solid mass surrounding the external urethral meatus. She had difficulty on urination for two weeks. Since she had acute urinary retention, urinary cathaterization was done under sterile conditions and almost 750 ml urine was evacuated with 16 Fr urethral catheter. Urine sample was obtained for microbiological and serological evaluation.\nAfter urine culture was proved sterile, the urethral mass was completely excised under spinal anesthesia. Histopathological examination revealed hyperplastic changes on the papillary surface and koilocytotic changes in metaplastic squamous epithelial cells verifying the human papillomavirus infection. Surgical margins were negative. Urethral catheter was removed two days after the surgery and the patient discharged with normal urination without postvoiding residual urine. At the postoperative first month control, vaginal smear and the type of human papilloma virus was sampled by the gynecologist. Appearence of external meatus was normal and she had no urinary symptoms with no residual volume. Uroflowmetric examination showed normal Qmax and Qaverage values (25.6 ml/s and 12.8 ml/s, respectively)."
