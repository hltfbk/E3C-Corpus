  "text": "We report of a 25-year-old male patient with epilepsy since the age of 18 and displaying clinical signs of LE and a high titer of GAD65 ABs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. Monthly, repetitive, intravenous cortisone pulse therapies that were initially administered for 6 months failed to improve his condition. Subsequent flow-cytometry analysis of CSF showed especially an increased fraction of activated HLA-DR(+) CD8(+) T-lymphocytes (fCD8(+)TL) when compared to controls. Thus, a second, intravenous cortisone pulse therapy with an additional basiliximab dose of 20 mg/month was started. After 3 months, the fCD8(+)TL in the CSF normalized; after 6 months, the psychological impulse-control deficits normalized; and after 11 months the patient was seizure free. However, 7 weeks later, seizures and, later on, psychological deficits recurred and fCD8(+)TL was once again present in the CSF. Flumazenil PET, magnetic resonance imaging-volumetry, and neuropsychological changes during therapy are described."
