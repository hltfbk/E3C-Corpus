  "text": "A 10-month-old male infant, with a known medical history of epileptic encephalopathy, was referred to the accident and emergency department of our hospital. The parents of the youngster reported inability of the child to move his left lower limb and inconsolable crying following several epileptic seizures. A radiograph revealed the existence of SCFE in the left hip. The fracture was reduced (with gentle closed traction under general anesthesia) and a hip spicacast was applied. It was removed at 8 weeks. Physical examination at this stage revealed a painless hip with a full range of motion. Painless hip range of motion was retained during all follow-up visits throughout the next 22 months. Amagnetic resonance imaging scan at 2 years post-reduction showed normal shape and size of the affected femoral head, with no signs of physeal arrest and/or avascular necrosis."
