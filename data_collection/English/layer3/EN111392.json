  "text": "A 35-year-old man with a penetrating dorsolateral thoracic injury referred to the emergency department. Despite an elevated pulse rate, the patient has proper blood pressure and O2 saturation. Considering the patient's stability and the results of imaging which did not show any massive vascular injury, the patient was taken to the operation room for thoracoscopy. At thoracoscopy, we saw 4 cm of the blade in the thoracic cavity between the third and fourth intercostal space. There was a mild laceration of lung tissue without any active bleeding. Considering the position of the blade and the absence of active bleeding and vascular injury at the trauma site, we successfully removed the blade by the thoracoscope without any complications."
