  "text": "An 80-year-old man was referred to our hospital with poor control of inflammation and intraocular pressure (IOP). The IOP in his left eye was 29 mm Hg. Anterior chamber cells (2+) and keratic precipitates were observed. In the peripheral retina, vitreous opacities and granular necrotizing retinitis were noticed. Fluorescein angiography revealed extensive retinal nonperfusion area from the macula lesion to the periphery. PCR analysis of aqueous humor showed the presence of CMV. A diagnosis of CRN was made soon afterwards. Antiviral drug and systemic corticosteroid were administered. The treatment temporally resolved the symptom; however, panretinal photocoagulation and intravitreal injection of bevacizumab were performed to treat iris neovascularization. During the follow-up, trabeculectomy was performed because of poor IOP control. At the final visit, severe uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma caused hyphema, and his left eye lost light perception."
