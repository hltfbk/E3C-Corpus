  "text": "We herein describe a 67-year-old male patient with a solitary mediastinal lymph node metastasis three years following the resection of his primary rectosigmoid carcinoma. Pathological characteristics of the metastatic tissue and technical limitations in imaging modalities resulted in incongruity between follow-up CT and PET scans. Diagnosis of this distant metastasis has been confirmed through a mediastinoscopic biopsy."
