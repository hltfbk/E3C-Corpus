  "text": "A 72-year old female with a long-standing renal transplant was diagnosed with advanced melanoma in 2018 and was treated with the anti-PD1 antibody nivolumab. Within 12 days after the first administration of nivolumab, dd-cfDNA ratio increased to 23%, suggesting allograft rejection. Her kidney transplant function deteriorated and acute rejection was confirmed by renal transplant biopsy. As the rejection could not be controlled despite immunosuppressive treatment, a transplant nephrectomy was necessary and haemodialysis was started. Immunological analysis of the renal explant showed infiltration of alloreactive, nivolumab-saturated, PD1+ cytotoxic T cells. After transplant nephrectomy, she experienced nivolumab-related toxicity and rapid disease progression."
