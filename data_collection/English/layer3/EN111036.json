  "text": "Our patient, a 72 year-old male on rivaroxaban, presented with persistent bleeding following a punch biopsy of the buccal mucosa. Given the site of bleeding, inability to effectively tamponade, patient's anticoagulated state, and risk of impending airway compromise, a dressing was soaked with 500 milligram (mg) of TXA and was held in place with pressure using a makeshift clamp until a thrombus formed. Hemostasis was achieved preventing the need for acute ENTotolaryngologic intervention and/or intubation. The patient was observed in the medical setting overnight and discharged home without any recurrence of bleeding or adverse events."
