  "text": "A 65-year-old woman had limited ability in extending her leg and an inability to perform a straight leg raise after multiple operations due to patella fracture. The patient underwent patellar tendon reconstruction with LARS artificial ligaments. After 12 mo of follow-up, the patient was able to perform a straight leg raise, and the incision healed well without complications. The Lysholm score was 95 and the range of motion of the knee was 0-130°."
