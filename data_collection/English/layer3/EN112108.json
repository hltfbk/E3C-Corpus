  "text": "A 62-year-old female underwent uneventful PKP for the management of post-irradiation actinic keratopathy. Three months postoperatively, she presented with a diffuse corneal melting abscess that was infiltrating the donor-recipient junction. Despite intensive antibiotic and antifungal therapy, corneal melting progressed to graft perforation. A repeat PKP combined with intraoperative PACK-CXL was performed. PACK-CXL was applied initially on the infected graft, involving the corneoscleral rim and then following placement of the donor button. No intra- or postoperative graft-related complications were encountered. No signs of infection were noted, and the graft remained clear during the 9-month follow-up period."
