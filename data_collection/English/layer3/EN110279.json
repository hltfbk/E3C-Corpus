  "text": "History and examination: This 7-year-old girl, previously healthy, was admitted to the emergency department for an epileptic attack, she described four episodes of partial seizure secondary generalized. Neurological examination revealed postictal confusion, hemiparesis and bilateral papilledema. Headache and vomiting were not experienced. An anticonvulsant therapy was administrated.\nMagnetic resonance images (MRI) demonstrated well-defined round (spherical) entirely surrounded by brain parenchyma hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images) and hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images. The walls of the cyst were hypointense on T1- and T2-weighted images and contain few peripheral daughter cysts. No calcification, no surrounding edema, and no contrast enhancement were seen. Preoperative radiological diagnosis of cerebral hydatid cyst was suggested. Abdominal ultrasonography and X-ray chest were performed and failed to reveal any associated hydatid cyst in lungs and liver. Operation: emergency surgical intervention was performed. After craniotomy the entire cyst was removed without rupture during the dowling technique. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of hydatid cyst. Postoperative course: the patient’s postoperative course was uneventful; the patient’s neurological status remained good. Postoperative CT confirmed total removal of the lesion she was discharged from the hospital on postoperative Day 5. Full recovery took place one month later. Seizure or recurrences were not seen during follow-up period."
