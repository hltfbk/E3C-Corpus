  "text": "A 58 year-old-man, with past family history of consanguinity, hypertension and a personal history of idiopathic hypertension for 10 years was admitted at the department of neurology, Hassan II University Hospital Center for status epilepticus with demential and tetrapyramidal syndromes. The ophtalmological examination showed a macular degeneration and the cardiovascular exploration found mitral, aortic and tricuspid insufficiency. Resonance magnetic imaging of the brain revealed a vascular leucoencephalopathy with numerous supraprotuberantial lesions of low intense signal T1 and hypersignal T2 and flair. The chest X-ray was normal. Laboratory data including blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation ratio, thyroid stimulating hormone, hepatitis, treponema and HIV blood serologies were normal. The cytologic, bacteriologic, treponema serology and cerebrospinal fluid pressure were also normal. During his hospitalization a dermatological exam for lesions in the patient's neck was required and found multiples small yellowish papules with size ranging from 1 to 5 mm, organized in reticulated pattern on the posterolateral side of the neck. The age of their appearance wasn't precise. The diagnostic of systemic elastorrhexis was suspected and confirmed by the biopsy of the affected skin showing in the mid-dermis a degenerated, fragmented and irregularly clumped elastic fibers of a granular appearance. The patient was treated symptomatically for his neurological and cardiovascular complications by Phenobarbital, platelet inhibitors, statine and by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The genetic study was not done because of the lack of molecular biology's specialized laboratory in our country."
