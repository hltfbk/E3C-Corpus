  "text": "A case of concomitant choroidal melanoma in a woman with primary breast carcinoma is described. The choroidal lesion was thought initially to be a metastasis, and treated with external beam radiotherapy. The tumour did not regress but remained stable in size for a period of three years. Following referral to an ophthalmologist, the diagnosis was revised after re-evaluation of the clinical, ultrasonographic and angiographic findings."
