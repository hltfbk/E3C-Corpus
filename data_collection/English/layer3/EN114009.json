  "text": "We treated a 52-year-old female pianist who complained of pain in her left thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. She had undergone two previous ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty procedures on the joint, for which strips of the flexor carpi radialis tendon and the abductor pollicis longus tendon were used in the first and second operations, respectively. The pre-operative X-ray demonstrated proximal subsidence and impingement of the first metacarpal on the scaphoid. We performed suspension arthroplasty combined with intercarpal ligament reconstruction using a strip of the ECRL tendon to create the trapezial space. 3 years after surgery, despite the 3 mm subsidence of the thumb compared with immediately after surgery, her thumb pinch and grip strength had improved, and the thumb basal pain was relieved."
