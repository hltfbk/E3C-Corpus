  "text": "We report a case report of a 48-year-old male who presented to the emergency room for recurrent syncope. He was found to have a ventricular colloid cyst causing uncal herniation. The patient was noted to be intermittently apneic and bradypnic. Transient hypoventilation was successfully treated with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation and the patient made a full neurological recovery following transcallosal resection of the colloid cyst. Subsequently, the hypoventilation resolved."
