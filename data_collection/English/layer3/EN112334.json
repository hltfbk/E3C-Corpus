  "text": "A 50-year-old man presented with severe right inguinal and lower abdominal pain. Initial diagnosis at the emergency department was incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernia. The computed tomography scan revealed diffuse edematous changes of right spermatic cord and vas deferens with peripheral fat stranding. Correlating with his clinical symptoms, signs, and imaging findings, the diagnosis of vasitis was made. We report a case of acute vasitis about the cause, symptom, pathogen, differential diagnoses, image findings, and treatment."
