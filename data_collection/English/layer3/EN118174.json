  "text": "A 39-year-old lady was admitted to gynaecological ward with the complaint of painful suprapubic mass with no bowel symptoms. Subsequent investigations raised the suspicion of tubo-ovarian abscess. The laparotomy revealed burst appendicular mass with involvement of ovaries and part of inflamed bowels. Hence right salpingo-oophorectomy, appendicectomy and right hemicolectomy were performed. The patient made un-remarkable recovery."
