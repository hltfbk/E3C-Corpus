  "text": "A 17-year-old Caucasian female patient who had undergone an ovariectomy and been diagnosed with a struma ovarii was subsequently found to have persistent subclinical hyperthyroidism with a low radioiodine uptake. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging and iodine-131 whole body scanning showed no residue or recurrence and a thyroid ultrasonography was normal. Laboratory and histopathological findings suggested Hashimoto's thyroiditis as the cause of the subclinical thyrotoxicosis, which had presumably started at the ectopic tissue."
