  "text": "A 70-year-old male presented with dizziness for 2 days. He had a history of oral cavity cancer a year ago, and the tumor was treated by surgical excision after induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Electrocardiography showed complete AV block with ventricular escape rate of 43 beats per minute. Cardiac imaging revealed about 4.0 × 2.0 cm-sized mass invading interventricular septum and AV nodes and protruding into the right ventricle. Magenetic resonance imaging of head and neck demonstrated recurred mass in oral cavity and maxillary sinus. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography showed hypermetabolic lesion in both oral cavity and the heart around interventricular septum and atrioventricular node indicating recurred oral cavity cancer with cardiac metastasis. Permament pacemaker of DDD type was implanted for the symptomatic complete AV block, and palliative chemotherapy was initiated."
