  "text": "Forty-year-old Japanese male patient presented with acute paraplegia. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the spinal cord revealed intramedullary hemorrhage. An intramedullary mass lesion was detected at the 8th thoracic vertebral level (T8) in a gadolinium enhanced-MR image. Spinal angiography revealed an intramedullary tumor stain at the level of T8. Therefore we diagnosed the problem as intramedullary hemorrhage caused by the hemangioblastoma. One month after the onset, extirpation of the intramedullary hemangioblastoma was performed. The tumor was completely removed. Pathological findings revealed a typical hemangioblastoma. At his final follow-up visit, the patient showed no apparent neurological recovery."
