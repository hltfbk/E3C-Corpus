  "text": "We describe a 36-years old Caucasian female with no known history of TB who presented with hip pain thought to be due to femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI). In the course of 18 months, the patient had been investigated extensively; including steroid injection, hip arthroscopy (including synovial biopsies), and eventually a total hip arthroplasty. During arthroplasty, further extensive biopsies were performed which raised the suspicion of TB on histology. Further synovial biopsies obtained arthroscopically were microbiologically positive for TB (PCR). The patient was sent to an infectious disease specialist. It appeared that the patient had TB in the past, of which she was unaware."
