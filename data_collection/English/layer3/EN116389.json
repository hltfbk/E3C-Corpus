  "text": "We describe the case of a 50-year-old immunocompetent Japanese man with pulmonary tuberculosis in the form of multifocal nodules. He came to our hospital because of a chest X-ray abnormality. During the course of observation, some nodules reduced while others enlarged in size. Two years after the first visit, fever and pleural effusion appeared. The sputum examination turned out to be positive for tuberculosis. A course of anti-tubercular agents resolved the pleural effusion and multifocal nodules."
