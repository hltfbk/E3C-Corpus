  "text": "A 64-year old female presented with painless and progressive shrinking of her right eye. Visual acuity was 6/6 in both eyes. The main clinical findings included exophthalmometry readings of 14 mm in the right eye and 22 mm in the left eye and a linear scar on her right forehead. This scar is a feature of linear scleroderma and called \"en coup de sabre\". She was referred to a dermatologist for further assessment."
