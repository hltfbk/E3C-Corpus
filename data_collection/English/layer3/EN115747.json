  "text": "A 2 years 8 months Mexican mestizo male patient was evaluated due to a trisomy 1q and monosomy 3p derived from a familial t(1;3)(q41;q26.3). Four female carriers of the balanced translocation and one relative that may have been similarly affected as the proband were identified. The implicated chromosomal regions were defined by microarray analysis, the patient had a trisomy 1q41-qter of 30.3 Mb in extension comprising about 240 protein coding genes and a monosomy 3p26.3-pter of 1.7 Mb including only the genes CNTN6 (MIM 607220) and CHL1 (MIM 607416), which have been implicated in dendrite development. Their contribution to the phenotype, regarding the definition of trisomy 1q41-qter and monosomy 3p26.3-pter syndromes are discussed."
