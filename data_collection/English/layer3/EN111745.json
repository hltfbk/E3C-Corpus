  "text": "A 47-year-old woman visited our hospital with a non-tender palpable lesion in her left breast. The lesion had not shown changes for 10 years. However, it recently increased in size. Sonography showed a well circumscribed cystic lesion with internal debris and fluid-fluid level. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a well circumscribed oval mass with T1 hyper-intensity compared to muscle and T2 high signal intensity. There was a small enhancing mural component in the inner wall of the mass. The tumor was resected. Its pathologic result was a malignant transformation of benign sweat gland tumor such as hidradenoma. The lesion was treated with excision and radiation therapy. At 1-year follow up, there was no local recurrence or metastasis in the patient."
