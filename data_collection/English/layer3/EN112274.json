  "text": "Here, we report the first case of a novel/de novo variant in a Mexican patient with CF. Our patient was an 8-year-old male who had exhibited the clinical onset of CF at one month of age, with steatorrhea, malabsorption, poor weight gain, anemia, and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Complete sequencing of the CFTR gene by next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed two different variants in trans, including the previously reported CF-causing variant c.3266G > A (p.Trp1089*, W1089*), that was inherited from the mother, and the novel/de novo CFTR variant c.1762G > T (p.Glu588*)."
