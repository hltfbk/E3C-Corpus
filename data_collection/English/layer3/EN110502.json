  "text": "A 32-years-old woman without significant past medical history was hospitalized in our department with 15 days history of shortness of breath. Physical examination was unremarkable, and the patient denied any exposure to asbestos. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm. There were no conduction or repolarization abnormalities. Chest X-ray showed an enlarged heart. Transthoracic echocardiography (TEE) revealed a mild pericardial effusion without signs of cardiac tamponade and with preserved biventricular function. The diagnosis of acute pericarditis was retained, and the patient was discharged in a stable condition with colchicine and ibuprofen. A month later, she was readmitted for chest pain. On physical examination, she has not been febrile and there were no heart murmur or signs of pulmonary congestion. Her central venous pressure was normal and there was no pedal edema. Vital signs showed a blood pressure of 96/55 mmHg, a pulse of 110 beats per minute, and peripheral oxygen saturation of 98%. ECG revealed sinus rhythm tachycardia with negative T waves in inferior and antero-septo-apical leads. TEE showed a worsening of the pericardial effusion but with no signs of right ventricular chambers collapse. We further noted an incipient systolic right ventricular dysfunction. Creatinin, troponin and NT pro-BNP levels were within normal ranges. Hepatic and thyroid functions were normal. Inflammatory markers were elevated with a c reactive protein level of 166 mg/L. Blood count revealed anemia. Cardiac tomography (CT) scan showed a circumferential pericardial effusion with no pericardial thickening or other abnormalities. Auto-immune pericarditis was unlikely as we did not detect positive rheumatoid factor, cryoglobilins, antinuclear, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Further investigations including serology for viruses commonly incriminated in pericarditis, human immunodeficiency virus, brucellosis, salmonellosis, toxoplasmosis, fever Q and Lyme disease as well as tuberculin skin test were also negative.\nThus, a definitive diagnosis could not be obtained, so we opted for pericardiocentesis. Cytological examination showed subacute inflammation with lympho-plasmacytic predominance and mesothelial hyperplasia, but without any signs of malignancy. The patient was treated for suspected tuberculous pericarditis. Six weeks later, with the decrease in corticosteroid therapy, she consulted for recurrence of the same symptomatology. TEE was performed and showed a pericardial effusion with paradoxical septal motion.\nShe was scheduled then for a thoracoscopic surgical biopsy. Histopathological examination of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma with right ventricular myocardial invasion. On immuno-histo-chemistry, neoplastic cells were strongly positive for calcretinin and WT1 protein. We referred her for palliative chemo and radiotherapy, but she died of refractory heart failure 4 months following the definitive diagnosis."
