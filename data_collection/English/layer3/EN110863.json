  "text": "Here, we report a case of severe soft tissue atrophy that appeared along with scar formation after mandibular reconstruction through the fibular free flap procedure. This led to normal occlusion collapse after it was established, and the midline of the mandible became severely deviated to the affected side that was replaced with the fibula free flap, leading to facial asymmetry. We corrected the malocclusion with a secondary operation: a sagittal split ramus osteotomy on the unaffected side and a sliding osteotomy on the previous fibula graft. After a healing time of 3â€‰months, implants were placed on the fibula graft for additional occlusal stability."
