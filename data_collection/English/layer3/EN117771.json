  "text": "In this report, we present a unique case of Boerhaave's syndrome in a 53-year-old male patient. In contrast to the more common acute presentation, our patient developed non-specific symptoms in association with an intrathoracic cyst. In this report, we will also review the usual presenting signs, symptoms, and treatment of Boerhaave's syndrome."
