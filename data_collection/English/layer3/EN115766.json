  "text": "A 41-year-old Japanese male with right ischiac pain was diagnosed with a giant cell tumor in his right ischium. Since the tumor extended to the acetabulum, there was a possibility that en bloc resection might significantly impair function of the hip joint and curettage could cause massive bleeding. Therefore, denosumab therapy (120 mg, administered 3 times every 4 weeks) was performed before radical surgery. The giant cell tumor of bone was treated with denosumab successfully. No adverse reaction was noted. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b secretion was measured in the patient's serum to monitor the response to denosumab, and a rapid normalization of the marker was observed after the first denosumab administration."
