  "text": "We describe an unusual case of a large polypoid mass arising from the nipple and connected to it by a long pedicle in a female of 45. The lesion comprised spindle and stellate shaped cells with bizarre stromal giant cells. The morphological and immunohistochemical diagnostic features are provided together with a discussion of possible mimics."
