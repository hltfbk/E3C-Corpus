  "text": "We present you a case of lipomatosis arborescens of the right knee in a 28-year-old male. The magnetic resonance imaging images showed high signal intensity villous or nodular foci on both T1- and T2-weighted images which were indicative of fat globules. They were predominantly found in huge number in suprapatellar pouch. The patient underwent arthroscopic synovectomy showing numerous broad- based polypoid or thin papillary villi composed of fatty tissue. Approximately 40 cc of lobulated globules were removed, and some were sent to histopathology which confirmed the presence of benign synovial tissue and fragments of adipose tissue present beneath the synovial surface. On 1-year follow-up, the patient was free of pain and devoid of any mechanical symptoms."
