  "text": "A 28-year-old female with no pathological history, consulted for chronic headache without a history of recurrent tonsillitis. On physical examination the palatine tonsils were hypertrophied and symetric, the throat isthmus was symmetrical. There were no palpable neck masses or other findings on head and neck examination. An injected cerebral computed tomography performed, showed cystic formation of the right palatine tonsil which enhanced in peripheral with a center of fluid density. The patient underwent tonsillectomy under general anesthesia for diagnostic purpose. Histopathologic examination showed a cystic formation lined by a squamous epithelium surmounted by parakeratotic hyperkeratosis. It contains neutrophils in exoxtosis and rests on lymphoid tissue. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of epidermoid cyst of the tonsil.\nThe patient was discharged without any postoperative complications; her follow-up after 24 months was entirely uneventful."
