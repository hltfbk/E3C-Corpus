  "text": "We presented a 9-year-old boy with a past medical history of circumcision at the age of one year with Plastibell clamp who was referred with severe chronic penile injury due to neglected plastibell string. After string removal under a loupe magnification (4×), we saw a deep circular injury at distal penile shaft which led to painless glandular autoamputation 45 days later. The patient was managed conservatively with daily urethral self-dilation until future reconstructive surgery."
