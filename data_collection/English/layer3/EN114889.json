  "text": "We report the case of a 53Â year- old male patient who was referred to our Trauma department (level I trauma center) after the first manifestation of a posterior shoulder dislocation due to an epileptic seizure, originated in a- up to this date unknown -glioblastoma. After closed reduction of the dislocated shoulder the X-ray showed a subcapital fracture of the proximal humerus with a large reversed Hill-Sachs lesion. We performed an open surgery via a deltoideopectoral approach and balloon osteoplasty was used to reduce the impression fracture (Hill-Sachs lesion) before fixing the fracture with a locking plate. In the post-operative CT scan we could show an anatomical reduction of the Hill-Sachs lesion. At the follow-up examination one year after surgery the patient reached full range of motion and stated no re-dislocation of the shoulder nor instability or pain."
