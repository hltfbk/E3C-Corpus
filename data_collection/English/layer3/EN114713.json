  "text": "We present the story of a 64-year old gentleman with exercise-induced weakness associated with tremor in his right arm. His left internal carotid artery was occluded at the bifurcation. Administration of statin and antiplatelet did not relieve his symptoms, and his stereotypic, exercise-induced \"limb-shaking\" episodes persisted. He underwent successful extracranial to intracranial (EC-IC) bypass, which stopped his symptoms. The patient, however, returned to our department and reported that he was able to recreate his original symptoms by compressing the bypass graft manually."
