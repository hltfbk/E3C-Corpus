  "text": "We present the case of a 38-year-old Afro-Brazilian woman with refractory ulcerative colitis who was started on infliximab. She had no previous history of liver disease, alcohol abuse, or infection. After the fifth dose of the medication, drug-induced liver injury was diagnosed. Treatment was discontinued but our patient's condition was aggravated by severe cholestasis and grade III/IV encephalopathy, requiring liver transplantation."
