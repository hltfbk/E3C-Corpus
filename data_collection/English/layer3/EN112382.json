  "text": "A 49-year-old man with CTEPH had undergone balloon pulmonary angioplasty four times; however, severe pulmonary hypertension remained. Moreover, he had Crohn's disease, and sufficient anticoagulant therapy could not be performed because of frequent melena. He also had frequent episodes of intestinal ileus resulting in malnutrition. After strict anticoagulant control with warfarin, PEA was performed safely with strict control of the activated coagulation time. After PEA, his pulmonary hypertension improved to a normal range, and he underwent abdominal surgery for the recurrent intestinal ileus."
