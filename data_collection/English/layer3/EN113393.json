  "text": "A 21-year-old female patient in good general and ophthalmological health with the wish to change the colour of her eyes was treated with a femtosecond-assisted annular keratopigmentation technique. Pigment was inserted in a channel in the cornea (external diameter 9.3 mm; internal diameter 5.5 mm) created with a femtosecond laser at a depth of 225 Î¼m. Eight months post-operatively, there were no signs of leakage, diffusion, inflammation or any other detrimental effects on the cornea both objectively and subjectively."
