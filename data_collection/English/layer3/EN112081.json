  "text": "We report here a case of a 68-year-old obese patient, who has acute small bowel obstruction due to strangulated internal hernia through an appendicular tourniquet. This appendicular tourniquet results from the adhesion between the tip of the appendix and its body. This obstruction was complicated by plugged perforation. Resection of the small bowel segment was performed, in addition to appendectomy, lavage, and drainage. The postoperative recovery was uneventful."
