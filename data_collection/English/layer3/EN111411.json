  "text": "A 50-year-old man who had undergone proximal gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction for esophagogastric junctional cancer 3 months before was admitted to the hospital due to gastrointestinal perforation. We performed emergency surgery and abdominal symptoms and inflammatory response improved postoperative. However, on POD3, he had eruptive bleeding at the just anal side of esophagojejunal anastomosis. Endoscopic clipping was unsuccessful because the mucosa was fragile and easily lacerated. Contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed the dilatation of the jejunal vein flowing into the ascending jejunal limb. Therefore, he was diagnosed as esophagojejunal varices rupture and percutaneous transhepatic obliteration (PTO) was tried for hemostasis. The portal and superior mesenteric veins were catheterized with the percutaneous transhepatic approach. Contrast agent injection into the jejunal branch demonstrated retrograde flow to the azygos vein through esophagojejunal varices. The microcatheter was inserted into the variceal blood supply branch and 10 mL of 5% ethanolamine oleate with iopamidol was injected. After obliteration therapy, the superior mesenteric venogram showed complete occlusion of the variceal supply branch. The patient was discharged from the hospital without any complications after 14 days."
