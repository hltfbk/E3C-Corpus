  "text": "A 46-year-old Japanese man experienced PLF after an extended right hepatectomy for liver malignancy. Seven months after surgery, the patient's Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score had reached 23. Doppler ultrasound study and three-dimensional computed tomography images showed a stenosed left hepatic vein compressed by surrounding hypertrophied hepatic parenchyma. Transluminal balloon angioplasty and stent placement therapy were conducted eight months after surgery. The pressure gradient between the hepatic vein and right atrium decreased from 13 to 3 mmHg after stent placement. Thereafter, the patient recovered."
