  "text": "We report a case of a 64-year-old African American woman, who presented to our emergency room with shortness of breath, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, leg swelling, fatigue, loss of appetite, cough with clear sputum, and lightheadedness. On admission, she developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation and acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis. A serologic workup was positive for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, antinuclear antibody, anti-histone, anti-cardiolipin IgM, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies. A renal biopsy was done due to persistent deterioration in kidney function and demonstrated classic crescentic (pauci-immune) glomerulonephritis. Hydralazine was empirically discontinued early in the admission and she was started on corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide following biopsy results. She was clinically stable but remained dependent on hemodialysis after discharge."
