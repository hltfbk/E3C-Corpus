  "text": "The patient was a 28-year-old Japanese male with XLA who previously had life-threatening infectious episodes and was referred for the possible indication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. After a thorough discussion within specialists from different backgrounds, we decided to perform allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation from his HLA-identical elder brother. Due to the non-malignant nature of XLA, we selected RIC consisting of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, anti-thymocyte globulin, and 3 Gy of total body irradiation. Neutrophil engraftment was achieved on day 11 with complete donor chimerism. No major complications, except for stage 1 skin graft-versus-host disease, were observed. The patient was discharged on day 75 and has been followed as an outpatient without any infectious episodes for more than 500 days."
