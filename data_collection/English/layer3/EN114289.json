  "text": "A 43-year-old gravida 5, para 1 (previous preterm birth at 24 weeks) patient with an in vitro fertilization twin pregnancy had an Arabin cervical pessary placed at 19 weeks of pregnancy due to the presence of cervical funneling identified by ultrasound screening. She developed chorioamnionitis and sepsis and delivered at 21 3/7 weeks after extraction of the pessary."
