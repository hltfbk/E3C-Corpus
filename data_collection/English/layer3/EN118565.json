  "text": "We here report a case of a 30-year-old male with hepatic solitary necrotic nodule discovered after an episode of acute abdominal pain and high grade fever. Routine laboratory data revealed leukocytosis and abnormal liver function. The imaging features of the lesion suggested malignancy or liver adenoma. The patient underwent surgical resection of segments V and VI. Histology was compatible with solitary necrotic nodule and localized vein thrombosis at the periphery."
