  "text": "A 31-year-old woman presented with headache and poorly controlled hypertension due to severe MAS. She had severe ostial stenoses of renal and visceral arteries. Her hypertension failed to respond to medical therapy (four drugs) and bilateral renal artery stenting. The implanted stent in the right renal artery rendered revascularization of the artery difficult. A one-stage revascularization was performed, which consisted of an aortoaortic bypass (between the suprarenal and infrarenal abdominal aorta) with a prosthetic graft, an orthotopic right renal autotransplantation and an aorto-left renal arterial bypass with autogenous saphenous vein grafts. Her recovery was uneventful. At 1-year follow-up, the patient remained well. Her hypertension improved. A postoperative computed tomography angiography showed that all the grafts were patent with no abnormalities at the anastomosis."
