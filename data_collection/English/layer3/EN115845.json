  "text": "A 42-year-old Han Chinese woman with severe toothache received treatment in my Department of Endodontics. She had no significant past medical history. A dental examination revealed extensive distal decay in her left mandibular first molar, tenderness to percussion and palpation of the periradicular zone, and found a deep periodontal pocket on the buccal lateral. Vitality testing was negative. Periapical radiographic images revealed radiolucency around the mesial apex. Cone beam computed tomography detected an opaque enamel pearl in the furcation area with a prolate spheroid shape of 1.8mm wide and 8mm long."
