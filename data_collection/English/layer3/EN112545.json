  "text": "We present the case of a 31-year-old Caucasian male who had a prolonged journey from first presentation until diagnosis of BD. For 11 years, he presented symptoms affecting the oral cavity and oropharynx, with worsening odynophagia and dysphagia and ultimately, development of stridor. Flexible laryngoscopy showed significant laryngopharyngeal ulceration and scarring. Treatment was with colchicine, corticosteroids and azathioprine and supervised by one of three newly established BD Centres of Excellence in the UK."
