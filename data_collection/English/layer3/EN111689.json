She had ingested a herbal drink made from leaves of an unknown plant from her garden prior to onset of symptoms. She had urinary retention, mydriasis and sinus tachycardia. She was managed supportively with activated charcoal and hydration and the delirium completely resolved within 15â€‰hours. The presented unkown plant leaves were identified as Brugmansia suaveolens."
