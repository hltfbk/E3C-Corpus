  "text": "The patient was a 56-year-old female, who had undergone maxillary resection in 2011 for intraoral squamous cell carcinoma that presented as a swelling of the anterior maxillary gingiva. Five years later, there was no recurrence of the malignant tumor and a maxillary reconstruction was planned. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large bony defect in the dental-alveolar area of the anterior maxilla. Using the CT data, a 3D model of the maxilla was prepared, and the site of reconstruction determined. A custom-made mesh plate was fabricated using the 3D model (Okada Medical Supply, Tokyo, Japan). We performed the reconstruction using the custom-made titanium mesh plate and the particulate cancellous bone and marrow graft from her iliac bone. We employed the tunneling flap technique without alveolar crest incision, to prevent surgical wound dehiscence, mesh exposure, and alveolar bone loss. Ten months later, three dental implants were inserted in the graft. Before the final crown setting, we performed a gingivoplasty with palate mucosal graft. The patient has expressed total satisfaction with both the functional and esthetic outcomes of the procedure."
