  "text": "An 82-year-old woman with upper-right quadrant pain and associated nausea and vomiting was diagnosed with ectopic acute calculus cholecystitis. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed a V-shaped distortion of the extrahepatic bile ducts and a particularly extended twisted cystic duct, which indicated the presence of gallbladder torsion. Emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy confirmed the diagnosis and the patient recovered without incident."
