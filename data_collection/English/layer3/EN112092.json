  "text": "A 44-year-old Indian man from north India presented with history of fever of 2â€‰days' duration with severely painful cold extremities. No pulse could be recorded on examination. A diagnosis of symmetrical peripheral gangrene was made. During the etiological evaluation, Plasmodium vivax malaria was found leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation causing this complication. He was started on artesunate and lumefantrine combination therapy and he recovered completely without the requirement of amputation."
