  "text": "We present a case of a five-year-old female with Down syndrome diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). She came to our hospital with bleeding manifestations. Blood and bone marrow examination revealed promyelocytes showing a few fine granules and occasional Auer rods. Based on this morphology and cytochemistry, a diagnosis of APL microgranular variant (M3v) was made."
