  "text": "A 45-year-old Caucasian woman with invasive lobular BC underwent bilateral mastectomy. An AMC was found on CT scan. LA was done with a strict minimal touch technique. The appendix was resected with a 1â€‰cm margin of the cecal pole, and the specimen was removed from the abdomen in a retrieval bag. Pathology showed benign cystadenoma. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course."
