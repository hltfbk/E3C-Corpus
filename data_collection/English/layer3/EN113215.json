  "text": "A 65-year old woman, on dialysis for 17 years, complained of fatigue (weight 54 Kg, height 1.55 m, BMI: 23 Kg/m2; malnutrition inflammation index: 10; Charlson index 9). She had been treated with lithium for about 20 years. A heavy smoker, she was obese and diabetic when young, but stopped treatment after weight loss. She had undergone thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma, left hemicolectomy for colon adenocarcinoma, left quadrantectomy followed by radiotherapy for ductal mammary adenocarcinoma, subtotal parathyroidectomy for tertiary hyperparathyroidism. At the time of this report, she was on thrice-weekly hemodiafiltration (Daugirdas 2 Kt/V: 1.6-1.8). Her recent treatment included spironolactone, amlodipine, perindopril, valproate, lamotrigine, levothyroxine, vitamin D, calcium carbonate, sodium polystyrene and sevelamer. After she questioned her doctor about whether her fatigue might be the result of a drug interaction, levothyroxine interference was identified (TSH, previously normal, increased to 13.07 mU/L, after increasing sevelamer dose, and normalized after change of drug schedule)."
