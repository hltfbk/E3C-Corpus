  "text": "There are 6 cases of PCI with varied causes encountered, in which the etiology, endoscopic features, treatment methods and prognosis of patients were studied. One case was idiopathic, while the other one case was caused by exposing to trichloroethylene (TCE), and the remaining four cases were secondary to diabetes, emphysema, therioma and diseases of immune system. Of the six patients, all complained of abdominal distention or diarrhea, three (50%) reported muco-bloody stools, two (33.3%) complained of abdominal pain. In four other patients, PCI occurred in the colon, especially the sigmoid colon, while in the other two patients, it occurred in duodenum and rectum. Endoscopic findings were divided into bubble-like pattern, grape or beaded circular forms, linear or cobblestone gas formation and irregular forms. After combination of medicine and endoscopic treatment, the symptoms of five patients were relieved, while one patient died of malignant tumors."
