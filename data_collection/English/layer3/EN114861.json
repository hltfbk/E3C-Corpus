  "text": "We present a 71-year-old woman who developed visual symptoms with papilledema and chorea. Anti-CRMP5/CV2 antibodies were a feature of both the serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Although SCLC was suspected already at the time of the initial examinations, no signs of primary or metastatic tumors were revealed on chest X-ray, MRI or whole-body PET scan. EEG and bronchoscopy were also unremarkable. However, 6 months after the onset, a repeated PET scan and subsequent bronchoscopic biopsy revealed SCLC. In spite of chemotherapy, the SCLC progressed, and the patient died 14 months after the onset of the symptoms."
