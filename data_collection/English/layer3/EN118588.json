  "text": "A 19 year old man presented with a one hour history of the right upper eyelid injury from a wire fence. The loose end of the wire penetrated the full thickness of the eyelid in the direction opposite to the normal. The wire passed from under the eyelid, through the centre of the upper lid, to the external surface. After the application of topical anesthetic drops, the eye could be opened manually, the lid averted, and the wire passed out through the defect. No complications were observed. Post removal, the acuity increased to 6/9 and there was no intraocular penetration. Full recovery was observed as well."
