  "text": "We present a 24-year-old primigravida who presented to the maternity department with severe abdominal pains at 35 weeks. She was pale on clinical examination and haemodynamically unstable. She underwent emergency caesarean section with a preoperative diagnosis of concealed abruptio placentae. Intraoperatively we encountered a bicornuate uterus, delivered a fresh stillbirth, and noted a placenta percreta. A hemihysterectomy was done and she recovered after transfusion without complications."
