  "text": "A 30-year-old man had a large skin defect at the knee following a motorcycle accident. The patella tendon and patella were exposed. We use the sartorius muscle flap to cover the wound defect. First, a skin incision was done on the muscle alignment. Then, the sartorius muscle was dissected, and the proximal set of segmental vessels was identified and ligated. Afterward, the sartorius was moved into subcutaneous tunnel and expanded to provide coverage for the wound defect. Finally, we used the full-thickness skin graft to cover over the muscle flap. The flap and graft were survived. The patient could return to work after 1 month after the operation."
