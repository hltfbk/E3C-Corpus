  "text": "A 40 days old Caucasian infant was referred to our clinic with a 4 days history of fever and malaise, accompanying a painful swelling of four days duration involving the lower end of the sternum. Examination revealed a 2 cm swelling which was fixed to the underlying bone. A full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein were measured and x-rays (Anterior and Lateral views) and Ultrasound was performed. Blood cultures were also taken. The patient was commenced empirically to Vancomycin and Cefotaxime intravenously. The values of White Blood Cell (16,720), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (132 mm) and C-reactive protein (108 mg/dl) were elevated, the X-rays showed bone destruction and dislocation of the 3(rd) sternal nuclei and in the U/S performed appeared a soft tissue mass measuring 2,37/1,02 cm related to the periosteum. Surgical debridement was then performed and swab cultures were taken intraoperatively. The infant grew Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Enterococcus Species. The infant was discharged after 25 days from the hospital. He gradually improved over a period of 2 months, became pain free and repeated x-rays showed significant bone resolution."
