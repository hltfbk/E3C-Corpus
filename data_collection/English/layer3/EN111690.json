  "text": "Two lesions were successfully dissected using the da Vinci Surgical System through the same four ports on the right side of the chest and two-step docking. Firstly, the patient cart came from the dorsal side of the patient and the paravertebral neoplasm was dissected. Afterwards, the patient cart was undocked and the operation table was rotated 180 degrees counterclockwise. The robot was re-introduced and the patient cart came from the ventral side of the patient and the whole thymus was resected."
