  "text": "A 31-year-old Asian woman was administered in vitro fertilization treatment for her unexplained infertility. She complained of visually disturbing flashes in her peripheral vision during her pregnancy. She described these flashes as occurring usually in the morning hours or while walking, coming in sets of three to four, occurring five-six times a day and lasting for less than 5-10â€‰minutes. Her flashes were not accompanied by other ocular symptoms such as pain, redness, photophobia, or decrease in vision. Her ocular examination was normal. Neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging revealed no pathology. A diagnosis of visual illusory palinopsia secondary to in vitro fertilization treatment was made."
