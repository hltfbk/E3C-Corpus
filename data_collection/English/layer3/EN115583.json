  "text": "We encountered a rare case of gall bladder cancer with sarcoid-like reaction in the lymph nodes. Since regional lymph node swelling that was difficult to differentiate from metastasis was found preoperatively, swollen nodes were examined histologically using frozen sections. Based on this histology, the swollen nodes were diagnosed as showing sarcoid reaction and therefore extended lymphadenectomy was avoided. The patient did not receive any adjuvant chemotherapy and has shown no recurrence of disease as of 4Â years after surgery."
