  "text": "We present the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian woman operated on due to acute abdomen with a provisional diagnosis of acute appendicitis. During the operation a small amount of free intra-abdominal fluid was found. Her uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes were macroscopically normal. Therefore, with the suspicion of appendicitis, appendectomy was performed. Her blood cultures were negative while peritoneal fluid was positive for capsulated form of Streptococcus pneumoniae. A 30-day follow-up was performed and she was asymptomatic without any sign of infection."
