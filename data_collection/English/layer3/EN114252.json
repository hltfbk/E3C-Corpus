  "text": "A 19-year-old healthy male experienced severe back pain. There had been no significant traumatic event. A radiograph of the spine showed collapsed vertebra at Th6 and Th7 and magnetic resonance image of the spine showed intensity changes at Th6, Th7 and Th8. Bone mineral density (BMD) at the radius was low and urine N-terminal telopeptide (NTx) was very high. The patient was diagnosed with VCFs caused by low BMD. The patient had a medical history of epilepsy and had taken valproate for thirteen years. We instructed the patient to stop taking valproate and to begin taking bisphosphonate. As a result, urine NTx became normal."
