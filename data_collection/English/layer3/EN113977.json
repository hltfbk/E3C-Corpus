  "text": "A 10-year-old female patient was referred to our hospital due to right high-grade hydronephrosis and a right renal stone, which was detected due to hematuria. Laparoscopic pyelolithotomy and ureterocalicostomy were indicated because of the completely intrarenal pelvis with thinning of the cortex, especially at the lower calyx. A transperitoneal approach was implemented in a lateral flank position with four trocars. After exposing the renal hilum, the renal stone was extracted without lithotripsy by making a small longitudinal incision at the ureteropelvic junction. Then, the ureter was transected, and the renal pelvis was closed. A 2-cm incision was made at the lower calyx. Uretero-caliceal anastomosis was completed in a running fashion using 5-0 absorbable sutures. The operation time was 379Â min. The postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative imaging studies showed marked improvement of the right hydronephrosis."
