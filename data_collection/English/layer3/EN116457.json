  "text": "A 62-year-old Japanese woman had been treated for bronchial asthma for approximately 40 years. She presented with abdominal distension, and a radiographic examination showed intraperitoneal free gas and intramural gas, suggestive of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis. However, when her prednisolone dose was decreased from 30 mg to 0 mg for approximately a year because of improvement in her asthma symptoms, her abdominal symptom resolved, and the frequency of her bowel movements returned to normal."
