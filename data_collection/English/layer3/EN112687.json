  "text": "We report an extremely rare case of bilateral and symmetric dumbbell GNs of the cervical spine with NF-1. A 27-year-old man with NF-1 presented with a one-year history of gradually progressive right upper extremity weakness and numbness in both hands. Magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral and symmetric dumbbell lesions at the C1-C2 levels compressing the spinal cord. We performed total resection of bilateral tumors, and the postoperative histopathological diagnosis of the resected mass was GN. After operation, the preoperative symptoms were gradually relieved without complications. To our knowledge, this is the sixth report of cervical bilateral dumbbell GNs."
