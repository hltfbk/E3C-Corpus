  "text": "A 55 year-old man developed progressive left hemiparesis and aphasia over the course of several months. Brain MRI showed multifocal, mass-like enhancing lesions with increased susceptibility consistent with blood products. An extensive workup for infectious, autoimmune, and neoplastic etiologies was significant only for a markedly elevated serum ferritin at 1456 ng/mL. Two brain biopsies showed a non-specific inflammatory process. The patient was treated empirically with steroids and plasmapheresis, but he continued to suffer a progressive neurological decline and died one year after onset of neurological symptoms. Autopsy revealed profound histiocytic infiltration, perivascular lymphocytosis, and emperipolesis, compatible with CNS-HLH."
