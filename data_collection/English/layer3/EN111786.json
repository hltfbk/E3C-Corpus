  "text": "A 19-year-old male who played as a football goalkeeper visited our hospital with complaints of sustained pain from the right wrist to the hand after punching a ball. Scaphoid fracture was diagnosed on plain radiographs, whereas trapezoid fracture was overlooked. Computed tomography revealed a displaced trapezoid fracture associated with a scaphoid fracture. Both fractures were successfully treated by open reduction and internal fixation using cannulated screws. Almost complete bone union was achieved at 5 months after surgery. The patient returned to play as a football goalkeeper."
