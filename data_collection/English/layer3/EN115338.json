  "text": "A 60-year-old male patient presented with progressive left hemisphere stroke caused by extensive cardiogenic embolism of the common carotid artery and a thrombus closing the internal carotid artery from its ostium to the level of its intracranial division. The complex revascularisation therapy involving surgical embolectomy of the common carotid artery, thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery and intra-arterial thrombolysis has led to the improvement of arterial patency and has countered the progression of acute cerebral ischaemia."
