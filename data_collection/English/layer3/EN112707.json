  "text": "Here, we describe the case of a 29-year-old female who presented with fever, swelling of gums, neck pain, and weakness, which had persisted for 1 week. The patient had a white blood cell (WBC) count of 53.5 K/Î¼L, and a peripheral smear revealed a myeloid blast cell (blast) percentage of 8%. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck indicated lymphadenopathy. Fine needle aspiration of the cervical lymph node showed groups of atypical immature myeloid cells, mixed with occasional megakaryocytes, and infiltration of eosinophilic myeloid cells into the lymph node, consistent with myeloid sarcoma. Flow cytometry analysis revealed intermediate to large circulating blasts, with irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, and distinct nucleoli, indicative of AML, with monocytic differentiation. The patient responded well to chemotherapy with fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and idarubicin; WBC counts returned to normal and patient was discharged to home."
