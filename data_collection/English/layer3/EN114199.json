  "text": "A 72-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for further treatment of abdominal pain that developed 1Â day before presentation. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan revealed attenuated enhancement of the transverse colon. CT angiography showed SMA irregularities due to vasospasm. The middle colic artery could not be detected by CT angiography. No occlusion due to thrombus or embolism in the SMA and superior mesenteric vein was observed. Based on the findings, NOMI was suspected, and emergency laparotomy was performed, which revealed a segmentally necrotic transverse colon. The necrotic bowel was resected, and stomas were created."
