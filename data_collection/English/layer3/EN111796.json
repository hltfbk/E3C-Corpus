  "text": "A 66-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with the complaint of abdominal distention and a decreased appetite for 1 mo. The patient had a 20-year history of hepatitis B surface antigen positivity and a 5-year history of cirrhosis. She had been treated with Chinese herbal medicine for a long time. Liver function tests showed: alanine aminotransferase, 35 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 42 U/L; serum albumin (ALB) 32.2 g/L; and serum ascites ALB gradient, 25.2 g/L. Abdominal ultrasonography and enhanced computed tomography showed that the left branch of the PV was thin and occluded; the right branch of the PV was thick and showed a vermicular dilatation vein cluster in the upper pole of the right kidney that branched out and converged into the inferior vena cava from the bare area of the lower right posterior lobe of the liver. We diagnosed her with an extremely rare SPIVCS caused by portal hypertension and provided symptomatic treatment after admission. One week later, her symptoms disappeared and she was discharged."
