  "text": "We present a 74-year-old male with a painless lump in his left neck. Based on the fine-needle aspiration cytological findings, a possible malignant tumor was suspected. No evidence of a primary lesion was observed using imaging modalities including positron emission tomography/computed tomography. The patient underwent an ipsilateral modified radical neck dissection. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the neoplastic cells were positive for S100 protein and GATA3. A rearrangement of the ETV6 gene was noted during ï¬‚uorescence in situ hybridization, and the final histopathological diagnosis was MASC."
