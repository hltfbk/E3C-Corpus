  "text": "A 42-year-old male presented with complaints of low back pain for the past 4 years and inability to walk for the past 3 years. Blood investigations showed hypophosphatemia and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging revealed features of osteomalacia. DOTONAC PET-computed tomography (CT) showed a lesion in the greater trochanter suggestive of a phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor. CT-guided biopsy of the lesion was done which confirmed the diagnosis. The tumor was resected by intralesional methods (burring and cementation) with correction of hypophosphatemia by oral phosphorus supplementation. Patient clinically improved and was able to walk with support at the time of discharge."
