  "text": "A 39-year-old Japanese woman reported a visual field defect of 2-years duration in the right eye. The patient underwent visual field testing, full-field electroretinography (ff-ERG), SS-OCT, and a routine ophthalmologic examination. The best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally. The funduscopy examination was normal bilaterally. Visual field testing showed a relative paracentral scotoma in the right eye. SS-OCT scans showed an unclear interdigitation zone (IZ) throughout the posterior pole except for the foveal zone in the right eye. SS-OCT macular analysis showed thinning of the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) corresponding to the region of the IZ defect. ff-ERG showed almost normal flash ERGs and normal rod responses bilaterally. The cone response and flicker ERG response were decreased markedly only in the right eye."
