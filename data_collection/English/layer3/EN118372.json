  "text": "A 26-years-old man admitted to our clinic for his decreased visual acuity. Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral vitritis and optic disc swelling. However, the meticulously taken history included other complains like headache and oral ulcers. Further investigation with cranial MRI demonstrated cerebral vasculitis secondary to Behcet's disease."
