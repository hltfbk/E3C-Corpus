  "text": "A 32-year-old man with no antecedent comorbidities presented to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in South Western Nigeria with an acute onset high-grade intermittent fever with chills and rigors, headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, and vomiting. There was no reported diarrhea or yellowness of the eyes. Prior to presentation, he had used oral anti-malaria medications, oral ciprofloxacin and antipyretics with no improvement. He worked as an agricultural research fellow and routinely spent a fair amount of time at work outdoors in farms and fields. Physical examination showed an acutely ill looking febrile patient with a temperature of 38.9°C, blood pressure of 120/70mmHg, a pulse of 92 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 24 cycles per minute. The rest of his physical examination was normal. His initial laboratory evaluation showed a leukocyte count of 7,090/µl of which 84.7% were neutrophils, a hemoglobin of 14.5g/dl, and platelet count of 89,000/µl. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) and prothrombin time were prolonged by 15.2 and 5.3 seconds, respectively. A slightly elevated INR of 1.35, but a markedly elevated D-dimer of 224.6µg/ml (ref 0-0.5µg/ml) were observed. The renal biochemical parameters were normal except for creatinine of 1.5mg/dl. Apart from an AST of 223 IU/l and an ALT of 70IU/l, all other liver function tests were normal. Urinalysis revealed microscopic hematuria. Other investigations are detailed in Table 1. Intravenous ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and parenteral artesunate were commenced. On subsequent review, the temperature was 39.2°C, pulse was 102 beats per minute, and there was tenderness on the right iliac fossa and suprapubic areas. Ciprofloxacin was changed to ceftriaxone, and parenteral metoclopramide was added to control the vomiting which had persisted since admission. On the fourth day of admission, he complained of rhinorrhea. Further physical examination revealed a mildly inflamed pharynx with no significant regional lymph node enlargement. Pulse was 82 beats per minute, blood pressure 110/70mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 cycles per minute, and reduced breath sounds in the middle and lower zones. Chest X-ray showed perihilar patchy opacities worse on the right with few patchy opacities on the right upper and lower zones. With concern for a sub-optimally treated community-acquired pneumonia, azithromycin was added for atypical pathogens. The following day, the temperature was noticed to be 40.5°C despite regular antibiotics. Pulse was 100 per minute, blood pressure was 130-170/60-100mmHg. The respiratory rate was 62 cycles per minute, and SpO 2 was 79-81% while breathing ambient air. Percussion notes were dull on the right lower zone, and breath sounds were vesicular with a mix of coarse crackles and rhonchi on the right lower zone. A repeat laboratory evaluation showed worsening microscopic hematuria, thrombocytopenia, and a leukocytosis of 11,720/µl. Blood film for malaria parasite detection was repeatedly negative. Supplemental intranasal oxygen at 4L per minute was administered. Loratadine and amlodipine were added, and the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory support. In the ICU, the dyspnea improved with oxygen therapy by face mask. SpO 2 on oxygen therapy ranged between 93% and 97%. Respiratory rate was 26 cycles per minute, pulse was 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure was 135/76mmHg. However, he continued to have high-grade fever, tachypnea and developed diarrhea with dark-colored stools over the next 3 days while in the ICU. On the 10th day of admission, a positive result for viral hemorrhagic fever screening using real-time RNA polymerase chain reaction panel detecting the dengue virus was obtained. Supportive management was continued. After 16 days of conservative management, the patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home from the hospital. He was established to have a normal blood pressure with no medication after a year of follow up."
