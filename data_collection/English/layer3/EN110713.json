  "text": "A 59-year-old man was hospitalized due to nausea, vomiting and diarrhea for 2 d and sudden retrosternal pain and dysphagia for 10 h. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 9 years. Computed tomography revealed dilated lower esophagus, thickening of the esophageal wall, a mass-like lesion with a flocculent high-density shadow and gas bubbles in the esophageal lumen. On gastroscopy, immovable brown bezoars were found in the lower esophagus, which led to esophageal obstruction. Endoscopic fragmentation was successful, and there were no complications. The symptoms of retrosternal pain and dysphagia disappeared after treatment. Mucosal superficial ulcers were observed in the lower esophagus. Multiple biopsy specimens from the lower esophagus revealed nonspecific findings. The patient remained asymptomatic, and follow-up gastroscopy 1 wk after endoscopic fragmentation showed no evidence of bezoars in the esophagus or the stomach."
