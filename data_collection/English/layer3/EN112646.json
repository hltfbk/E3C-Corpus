  "text": "A 73-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a 2-week history of fever and profound fatigue. The only other symptom she endorsed was a transient history of left knee pain, initially thought to be unrelated. There was no clear cause on initial examination and routine investigations, but her C-reactive protein was significantly elevated at 207 mg/L. Blood cultures and a urine culture were drawn. She was admitted to hospital for further investigation and placed on empiric antibiotics. Her blood cultures were negative, but she had one further fever in hospital. Computed tomography scans did not yield a cause of her fever. No vegetations were seen on echocardiography. Antibiotics were stopped as she did not seem to have an acute infectious cause of her fever. No new symptoms developed. She felt well enough to proceed with out-patient follow up and was discharged after 8 days in hospital. At 1-month post-discharge: no resolution of symptoms, but she endorsed a recurrence of her left knee pain. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 4.5 × 6.8 × 11.6 cm soft tissue mass, identified as a sarcoma on biopsy. She subsequently underwent a distal femur resection. Final staging was pT2bN0M0. She underwent adjuvant radiation therapy, but was found to have developed metastatic disease."
