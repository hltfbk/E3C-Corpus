  "text": "A 14-year-old girl developed type A insulin resistance syndrome and showed high fasting insulin, glucose, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. The girl suffered from ovarian serous papillary cystadenofibroma. The laboratory results were as follows: fasting insulin was 2624.90 pmol/L and HbA1c was 8.5%. A heterozygous missense mutation on exon 20 of the insulin receptor gene (c.3601C>T, Arg1201Trp) was observed. The histopathological diagnosis was a cystic lesion that extended to the upper right uterus, indicating a right ovarian serous papillary cystadefibroma accompanied by focal interstitial hyperplasia. The patient was treated with metformin for over 6 mo. Additionally, laparoscopic resection (bilateral) of the ovarian lesion and laparoscopic intestinal adhesiolysis were performed under general anesthesia. Diet therapy combined with exercise was then initiated. The patient had an uneventful recovery. The patient also showed improved blood glucose control, with reduced levels of fasting insulin (857.84 pmol/L) and HbA1c (7.0%)."
