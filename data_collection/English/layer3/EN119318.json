  "text": "A 66-year-old man with cardiomyopathy and ischemic mitral regurgitation presented to us with the features of congestive heart failure. The three-dimensional echocardiography revealed severe mitral regurgitation associated with the tethering of the lateral (P1) and medial (P3) scallops of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve due to secondary chordal attachments. The ejection fraction was only 15% with severe global systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Mitral regurgitation was successfully corrected with mitral annuloplasty and resection of the secondary chordae tethering the medial and lateral scallops of the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve."
