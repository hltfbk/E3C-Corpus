  "text": "We report herein a case of POEMS syndrome that initially presented as hyperpigmentation and severe pitting edema of the lower extremities. Throughout the patient's multiple hospitalizations for more than one year, he was treated erroneously for Addison's disease and primary hypothyroidism due to the presence of limb numbness and weight loss. In addition, he was misdiagnosed with diabetic peripheral neuropathy due to a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus."
