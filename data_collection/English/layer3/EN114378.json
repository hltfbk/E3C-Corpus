  "text": "Three cases of symptomatic extra-articular hip impingement secondary to AIIS deformity and in conjunction with mild underlying femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) are presented. They include two athletic Caucasian males aged 27 and 35-years old with a history of prior rectus tendon injury and secondary bony exostosis formation and a 53-year-old Caucasian male with a nontraumatic, developmental AIIS deformity. In all cases, an excellent clinical outcome with a full return to pain free activity was achieved postoperation. Their clinical presentation, diagnosis and post-operative outcome at 1.5-2 years (mean 1.7 years) following arthroscopic AIIS resection are discussed."
