  "text": "A 66-year-old male presented with right conjugate deviation, right hemiparesis and total aphasia due to a convulsive seizure. Brain computed tomography showed symmetric calcifications in the bilateral basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellar dentate nuclei, which were consistent with IBGC. Diffusion-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple small infarctions in the bilateral cerebral subcortical area. In the search for the cause of cerebral infarction, SPECT with acetazolamide challenge revealed heterogeneous impairment of cerebrovascular reactivity in the whole brain, despite the absence of evidence for steno-occlusive changes in proximal arteries."
