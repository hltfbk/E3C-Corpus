  "text": "Our patient was a 39-year-old Ethiopian man who presented with left-side body weakness of 6 years' duration with worsening of symptoms of 6 months' duration. He had no history of trauma, meningitis, or previous surgery. The results of routine laboratory tests were normal. The diagnosis was made by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and was confirmed by surgery. Frontoparietal craniotomy was performed, and evacuation of non-foul-smelling collection was done. The patient was reoperated for tension pneumocephalus 48 hours after the initial surgery. He died 10 days later."
