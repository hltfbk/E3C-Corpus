  "text": "An 18-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with acute renal failure, erythrocyturia and massive proteinuria. Routine blood analysis showed leucocytosis (40,5 × 109/l) and a serum creatinine of 233 μmol/l. Infectious causes, e.g. leptospirosis or hantavirus infection, or an autoimmune disease, e.g., AAV or anti-GBM glomerulonephritis was the most feasible underlying diagnosis. Before hantavirus serology results were known, anti-GBM antibodies were positive. Treatment for anti-GBM glomerulonephritis was withheld, because of the absence of other signs and symptoms of the disease and slight improvement of renal function. The diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection was later on confirmed, by seroconversion of a follow-up serum sample. Without further intervention renal function recovered and anti-GBM antibodies disappeared."
