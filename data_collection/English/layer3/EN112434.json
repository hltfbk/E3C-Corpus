  "text": "A 60-year-old male got the left olecranon fracture (Colton classification, type 2A) visited our hospital. However, osteosynthesis using TBW was performed, soft wire breakage, K-wire distortion, and olecranon bone fragment displacement at 2 weeks after surgery. Reoperation was performed. TBW was performed using K-wires as intramedullary nails so that compression force could be applied as vertically as possible to the bone fragments. Furthermore, for further control of distal bone fragment instability, olecranon locking plate fixation was performed using a posterior approach. 12 months after the operation, the visual analog scale score was 2/10, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score were 2.27/100, and the Mayo Elbow Performance score was 85/100 (good). Plain X-ray examination showed favorable bone union."
