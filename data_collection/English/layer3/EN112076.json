  "text": "A 56-year-old Chinese male suffered from recurrent pain and swelling in his right knee after several times of \"small needle-knife\" acupuncture and corticosteroid injection of the joint. Candida parapsilosis was cultured in his synovial fluid and identified by sequencing of its Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) gene. Here we present the radiological characteristics, arthroscopic pictures, and synovium pathology of this patient. Also, blood test and chemical analysis of his synovial fluid were listed as well as the ITS sequence of this Candida species identified. The patient underwent thorough arthroscopic debridement and then set on fluconazole 400 mg daily for 12 months. His symptoms resolved and no relapse was observed on the last follow-up. Additionally, a brief but comprehensive review of C. parapsilosis arthritis episodes from past to now were studied."
