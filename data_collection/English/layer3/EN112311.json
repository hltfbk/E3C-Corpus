  "text": "A 49-year-old Indian man presented with progressively increasing swelling in his left hand of 2 months' duration. An X-ray showed a soft tissue lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a soft tissue mass lesion, with peripheral enhancement and central necrotic areas in radial palmar soft tissue overlying second metacarpophalangeal region with no obvious bony osteolysis. Possibilities of acute abscess, resolving hematoma, or aggressive soft tissue mass lesion were suggested. An incision biopsy showed morphological features of epithelioid osteosarcoma, which was confirmed on immunohistochemistry. A detailed history revealed that our patient was diagnosed as having osteosarcoma of his right leg 3 years previously. Based on history, radiology, morphology, and immunohistochemistry, a final diagnosis of extraskeletal (soft tissue) epithelioid osteogenic sarcoma of the left hand occurring as a metachronous tumor 3 years after diagnosis of primary osteosarcoma in the right leg was given."
