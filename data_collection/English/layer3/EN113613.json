  "text": "We present a case of 62-year-old female patient with a foot ulcer associated with osteomyelitis. After an initial assessment, a subtotal calcanectomy with primary wound closure was performed. After healing of the surgical wound, the patient started rehabilitation with recovery of dorsiflexion and independent gait without support after 12 weeks."
