  "text": "I am presenting a case of a 48-year-old woman with Addison-Biermer anemia, with co-existing mood disorders. The clinical analysis of the presented patient's history indicates diagnostic problems and a need for a detailed analysis of drug-related complications that occurred during previous treatment, eg, in the form of neuroleptic malignant syndrome."
