  "text": "A 65-year-old man presented to emergency department due to intermittent chest pain. Physical examination and chest x-ray were unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed biphasic T-wave in precordial leads V1-V4. Primary cardiac serum biomarkers including high-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) and CK-MB were slightly elevated, that further assessment did not show any increases; while ECG recorded during a pain period revealed T-wave pseudo-normalization. The patient underwent coronary angiography that revealed a proximal left anterior descending artery lesion."
