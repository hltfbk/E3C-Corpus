  "text": "A 40-year-old Chinese man underwent coronary stent implementation in the proximal right coronary artery due to acute inferior wall myocardial infarction at another hospital. Six months later, he underwent coronary angiography re-examination for recurrent symptomatic angina at our hospital. Coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound confirmed that the previous stent was deployed in the false lumen of the right coronary artery. Then, intravascular ultrasound was used to guide the wire to re-enter the true lumen of the proximal right coronary artery, and another stent was deployed into the true lumen to crush the previous stent."
