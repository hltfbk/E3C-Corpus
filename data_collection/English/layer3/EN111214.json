  "text": "A 32-year-old female was diagnosed with ischemic stroke caused by traumatic carotid artery dissection. Aspirin (100 mg/day) and clopidogrel (75 mg/day) were prescribed. Digital subtraction angiography performed 6 days after stroke onset showed a dissection in the cervical segment of left internal carotid artery with severe local stenosis, and a collateral pathway from BA to the cavernous segment of internal carotid artery through the lateral pontine and tentorial artery. Without interventional therapy, clinical symptoms improved significantly within 10 days after onset. At 3-month follow-up, left common carotid artery angiography showed the stenosis had been significantly improved with a residual aneurysm. There was no collateral pathway between carotid-vertebrobasilar arteries, and a residual small artery originated from the posterior vertical segment of cavernous internal carotid artery. The small artery was clearly visualized by 3-dimensional rotational angiography and identified the tentorial artery."
