  "text": "We present a patient with vitelliform maculopathy, a paraneoplastic retinal maculopathy that is under-recognized. Clinically the retinal findings of serous detachments and pigmentary macular changes are remarkable, while at the same time these patients have surprisingly very few symptoms. This is in contrast to patients who develop melanoma associated retinopathy (MAR) who are very symptomatic early in the disease, but with more subtle retinal findings."
