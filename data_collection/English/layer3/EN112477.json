  "text": "The first patient, a 76-year-old man, was diagnosed with cancer of the common bile duct and underwent PPPD 2 years after PG for gastric cancer. The remnant stomach and right gastroepiploic vessels were safely preserved. The second patient, a 56-year-old man with a history of PG for gastric cancer 20 years previously, was diagnosed with cancer of the common bile duct and underwent PPPD. We could safely preserve the remnant stomach and right gastroepiploic vessels."
