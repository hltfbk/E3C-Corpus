  "text": "We present a case of a 48-year-old Thai woman who presented with nephrotic syndrome due to systemic lupus erythematosus-related nephritis. Initially, few B. coli cysts were found in urine sediment, but these increased substantially following treatment with prednisolone. She made an uneventful recovery with 10â€‰days of oral tetracycline therapy. No B. coli cysts were found in her stool."
