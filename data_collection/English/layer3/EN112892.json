  "text": "We conducted a PUBMED literature review using key words 'granulomatosis with polyangiitis,' 'Wegener's,' 'GPA,' 'eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis,' 'Churg-Strauss,' 'EGPA,' 'overlap syndrome,' 'Wegener's with eosinophilia,' and 'GPA with eosinophilia' in English only journals from 1986 to 2017. Relevant case reports and review articles of overlap syndromes of GPA and EGPA were identified. We aim to report a unique case of GPA and EGPA overlap syndrome and review the cases that have been previously described. Between 1986 and 2017, we identified 15 cases that represent an overlap syndrome with compelling features of both GPA and EGPA. Patients ranged in age between 21 and 78. Of those whose gender was identified, 80 % of the patients were female. All cases described involved the lungs, 60 % reported sinus involvement, and more than 50 % displayed renal involvement. An overwhelming majority of patients were positive for c-ANCA and demonstrated eosinophilia (peripheral blood or tissue eosinophilia). A preponderance of the cases described were treated with systemic corticosteroids combined with an immunosuppressive/cytotoxic agents."
