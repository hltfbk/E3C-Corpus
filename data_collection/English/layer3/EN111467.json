  "text": "We report a case of a 17-year-old Syrian girl who previously had three episodes of recurrence of multiple rapidly enlarging fibroadenomas in her left breast and underwent three operations for complete resection of the lesions. However, a few months later, she was readmitted with multiple large masses in the same breast, and pathological findings confirmed a surprising combination of multiple fibroadenomas for the fourth time with a malignant phyllodes tumor (cystosarcoma phyllodes). The patient underwent lumpectomies followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Long-term follow-up was recommended."
