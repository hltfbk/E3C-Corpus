  "text": "We present a case of 29-year-old white male farmer, with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with imatinib who developed significant pancytopenia, leading to discontinuation of treatment. His neutrophil count fell to 0.5 × 10(9)/L, his platelets dropped to 85 × 10(9)/μL, and his hemoglobin was 6.4 g/dL. A bone marrow study was performed, showing complete remission of chronic myeloid leukemia and numerous Leishmania amastigotes within the macrophages. He used pentavalent antimonials replaced by amphotericin B due to acute cardiac toxicity. After 3 months, imatinib was restarted, and he again showed adequate control of the disease. The last polymerase chain reaction assessment showed a deep molecular response."
