  "text": "A 40-year-old Japanese woman with MPGN type III developed numerous yellow-white patches in the central macula of both eyes. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed deposits between the RPE and Bruch's membrane. Fluorescein angiography showed choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and OCT confirmed it as type 1 (sub RPE) CNV with fibrin tissue and subretinal fluid in the right eye. After 12Â months, the CNV and subretinal fluid resolved spontaneously but the RPE deposits remained in both eyes. Her final visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/16 in the left eye."
