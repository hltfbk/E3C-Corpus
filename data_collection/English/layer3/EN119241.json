  "text": "A 76-year-old woman sustained blunt chest trauma resulting from a fall from standing height. She was diagnosed with a mediastinal hematoma, and did well with supportive care. Follow up CT angiograms on days 2 and 4 of hospital stay revealed a stable hematoma and she did not require any intervention."
