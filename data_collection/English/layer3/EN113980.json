  "text": "A 64-year-old caucasian man with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma associated with brain metastases received four courses of nivolumab in concomitance with a high dose of corticosteroids for his neurologic symptoms. He experienced a partial response in his brain and chest with an improvement in his general condition. Nivolumab was effective in shrinking symptomatic brain metastases, and metastases at other sites, in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer and first-line chemotherapy failure. The effect of nivolumab was obtained despite concomitant high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Combined nivolumab and high-dose corticosteroid therapy did not induce unexpected adverse events."
