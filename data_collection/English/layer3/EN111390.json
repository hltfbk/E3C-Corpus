  "text": "A 19-year-old morbid obese male presented to the emergency department (ED) following a motor vehicle accident.He had a left lower extremity crash injury. In his serial examinations, he was complaining of upper abdominal pain with epigastric tenderness. After nasogastric tube (NGT) reinsertion, due to detecting coffee ground secretions in the drained fluid, the patient was transferred to the operating room.A midline laparotomy was performed that revealed dilation and discoloration of the stomach. Gastric decompression was performed. All the discoloration then disappeared except for that of certain suspicious areas, which necessitated evaluations. On the following day, given the lack of improvement in the patient`s condition, he was transferred to the operating room for a second laparotomy."
