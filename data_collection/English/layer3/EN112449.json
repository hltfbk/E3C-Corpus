  "text": "We report the case of a 56-year-old patient who presented to medical attention with palpable axillary adenopathy. Biopsy confirmed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Formal staging revealed extensive metastatic disease to bone and liver. Initial chemotherapy proved ineffective. We describe the diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and achievement of durable remission using a novel sorafenib-based drug combination that was chosen through the application of a functional analytic laboratory platform."
