  "text": "A 70-year-old male patient, who had been taking warfarin for artificial valve replacement, developed IDH and esophagogastroduodenal pneumatosis after endoscopic hemostasis for duodenal ulcer bleeding. Initially, he had abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension. Later, he was found to have acute pancreatitis, biliary obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction and rapid decline of hemoglobin also ensued. The intramural duodenal hematoma and critical condition resolved spontaneously after conservative medical treatment."
