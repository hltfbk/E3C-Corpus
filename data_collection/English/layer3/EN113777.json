  "text": "We present a case of 30-year-old man with simultaneous ACL and patellar tendon injury sustained in a RTA, riding pillion on a bike. The mechanism of injury was a direct blow on his flexed right knee followed by landing on the ground, on his foot with a twisting valgus thrust. Following clinical examination and radiographs, MRI was done which showed complete patellar tendon mid substance rupture and ACL tear. A staged procedure was planned, and the patient was taken up for immediate patellar tendon repair. This was followed by 5 weeks of cast immobilization. After 6 weeks, the knee was mobilized and ACL reconstruction was done using hamstring graft. At last, follow-up, the patient regained full knee extension and flexion up to 120Â° with normal gait."
