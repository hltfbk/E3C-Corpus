  "text": "Here, we describe a case of a 22-year-old white Caucasian man with blurred vision in his left eye who exhibited juxtapapillary choroidal neovascularization on optical coherence tomography angiography. Although multiple evanescent white dot syndrome is often self-limiting, to reduce the possibility of an inflammatory reaction, we preferred to administer prednisolone orally. After 3 months, significant regression of juxtapapillary neovascularization was observed by B-scan and optical coherence tomography angiography. Symptoms resolved in 3 months. A steady situation was observed at 4 years of follow-up."
