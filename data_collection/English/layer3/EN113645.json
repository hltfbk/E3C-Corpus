  "text": "A 46-year-old male with a history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma in remission presented with left upper extremity pain secondary to a diagnosis of Stiff Person Syndrome limited to his left upper extremity. He had previously benefitted from plasmapheresis and was on diazepam and baclofen at home with relatively good control of his symptoms. SPS had previously been diagnosed with EMG and anti-GAD-65 antibody titers and was confirmed by an elevated anti-GAD-65 antibody titer. He was treated with plasmapheresis and maximum doses of medical treatment including botulinum toxin with only transient mild improvement in his symptoms."
