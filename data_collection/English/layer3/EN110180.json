  "text": "A term female neonate born vaginally to a 29-year-old mother. There was no consanguinity, no family history of OI. Pregnancy was uneventful, prenatal laboratory test results were within reference ranges. First trimester ultrasound didn't objectified abnormalities. Prenatal ultrasound examination at 22 weeks of gestation objectified short and incurved limbs, narrow chest, with hypomineralization and multiple fractures of ribs and long bones. Interruption of pregnancy was proposed but refused by parents. Parents felt that the diagnosis was late. At birth, the newborn presented immediate neonatal respiratory distress. Postnatal examination showed macrocephaly, narrow chest, curved and shortened limbs. Postnatal bone radiography showed anomalies as follows: chest: hypomineralization, narrow thorax, multiple beaded ribs; limbs: bone demineralization, diaphyses deformities with fractures and callus formation; skull: poor mineralization, wormian bones. Based on postnatal findings, the diagnosis of OI type IIA was made confidently. Death occurred on day 25 of life related to respiratory failure, secondary to pulmonary hypoplasia."
