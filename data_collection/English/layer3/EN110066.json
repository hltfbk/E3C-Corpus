  "text": "A female neonate was referred for assessment of his right eyelids. She was born at term, to a primigravid mother, weighing 3400 g. Pregnancy and delivery were unremarkable. There was no family history of congenital anomalies or consanguinity. The baby was noted to have fused right eyelids at birth; apart from this, she was perfectly healthy. A detailed pediatric assessment failed to reveal any other congenital abnormalities. Ocular examination showed partial fusion of his right upper and lower eyelids by a central narrow band of tissue, arising from the grey lines. Full eyelid opening was impaired and interpalpebral aperture was limited to 3.5 mm. Right eye examination was normal. The band of tissue was excised with Vannas scissors at the level of each eyelid margin. The procedure was performed under sedation. There was a limited bleeding. Subsequent right eye examination did not reveal any other pathology. At her follow up appointment 5 months later, no abnormality was noted."
