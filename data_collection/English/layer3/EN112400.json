  "text": "We outline the case of a 73 years old African American female who was admitted with sudden onset shortness of breath and found to be in cardiogenic shock. Cardiac amyloidosis was suspected due to discordance between electrocardiogram and echocardiogram findings and this was subsequently confirmed with the aid of scintigraphy and an endomyocardial biopsy."
