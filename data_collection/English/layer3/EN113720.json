Clinical examination revealed erythema and swelling of the sternoclavicular area. Inflammatory markers were raised. Image investigation with CT and MRI was undertaken and verified the presence of bilateral sternoclavicular joint infection. The patient received prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics since his admission. The patient was discharged in a good condition and followed up in clinic."
