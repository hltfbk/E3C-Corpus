  "text": "Here we present two female siblings with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) born to a consanguineous couple. Both sustained severe bone deformities. However, only the younger had severe brain anomalies resulting in an early death from pneumonia, while the older had normal intellectual development. Next generation sequencing showed a homozygous mutation, c.6delG, p.Leu3Serfs*36 in WNT1. To our knowledge, it is the most 5' truncating mutation to date."
