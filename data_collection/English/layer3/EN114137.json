  "text": "A-17 year old caucasian boy with a genetically proven X-linked Alport syndrome presented with progressive dyspnea, fatigue and pallor. His blood tests showed a severe anemia (Hb 6.9 g/dl) with acute worsening of kidney function (serum creatinine, normal 9 months earlier, was now 3.6 mg/dl). Microscopic hematuria and proteinuria also worsened. He soon developed signs of alveolar hemorrhage. Serological tests showed the presence of perinuclear ANCA with anti MPO specificity. Kidney biopsy showed a necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. Pulses of methylprednisolone were given in combination with plasmapheresis. The patient further received 6 pulses of cyclophosphamide, followed by maintenance oral azathioprine. During the 15-months follow up he remained well with serum creatinine back to normal, and some residual proteinuria and hematuria ascribed to Alport syndrome."
