  "text": "A 65-year-old-man with a history of alcohol abuse was admitted to our hospital for abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having chronic pancreatitis with pancreatolithiasis and pseudocyst in the pancreatic tail. The pancreatic pseudocyst increased in size gradually for 4 month observation period. For intracystic hemorrhage we performed an urgent distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy. Postoperative course was good and the elevated serum amylase level decreased to the normal range."
