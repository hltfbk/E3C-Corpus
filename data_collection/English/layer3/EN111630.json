  "text": "A 75 y/o woman presented with tarry stool and dizziness. No definite bleeder could be identified by esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. The transabdominal sonography revealed a large heterogeneous tumor involving the muscular layer of the ileum. Strain elastography showed the strain ratio was 6.51. Strain histogram was skewed to the blue side, and mean color value was 230.5, signifying a stiff tumor. GIST was highly suspected. The patient underwent laparoscope-assisted tumor excision and the histological examination confirmed a malignant GIST. The patient was discharged without postoperative event."
