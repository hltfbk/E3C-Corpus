  "text": "Thirty-year-old male presented with fever and non-productive cough while on glucocorticoids for glomerulonephritis. He was found to have pulmonary aspergillosis and subsequently developed bilateral lower limb and cerebral fungal emboli and fungal abscess in the spleen. He had IgM and B cell deficiency and cytomegalovirus (CMV) and tuberculous co-infections. He recovered after prolonged course of antimicrobials, splenectomy and cessation of glucocorticoid therapy which also lead to the resolution of immune deficiencies."
