  "text": "A 57-year-old male with long-standing psoriatic arthritis presented with diffuse scaling of his skin. He was being treated with adalimumab, leflunomide, and topical clobetasol, but had recently stopped taking his medications. Physical exam revealed yellow scaling covering his entire body with underlying erythema and tenderness without mucosal involvement. Labs were notable for a creatinine of 3.3 mg/dL, with no prior history of renal disease, and uric acid of 12.7 mg/dL. He was admitted to the intensive care unit given >80% of body surface area involvement and acute renal failure. Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation, renal function did not improve, and creatinine peaked at 4.61 mg/dL. Urine microscopy showed diffuse polymorphic uric acid crystals, consistent with uric acid crystal-induced nephropathy. He was started on rasburicase, urinary alkalinization, and fluids. His renal function improved dramatically; urine output, uric acid, and electrolytes normalized. He was discharged on topical clobetasol and leflunomide and started on secukinumab with little to no skin involvement."
