  "text": "A 43-year-old Thai male presented with focal seizure, headache, and anterior pituitary hypofunction. His MRI study showed typical hypophysitis lesion with abnormal cerebral parenchymal signal intensity at right frontal lobe. The pituitary biopsied was obtained and the patient was initially diagnosed with lymphocytic hypophysitis. Following initial low-dose steroid therapy, his seizure and headache resolved but his anterior pituitary hormones remained deficient. However, during steroid tapering, he developed new onset acute visual loss. Upon rigorous pathologic review, his diagnosis of IgG4-related hypophysitis with suspected CNS involvement was established. He was subsequently treated with high-dose steroid and rapidly regained his sight."
