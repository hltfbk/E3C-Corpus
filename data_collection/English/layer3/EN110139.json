  "text": "He's a 70 years old man who had for 9 years ago a painless nodule at the left breast. It was movable relative to superficial and deep plans. Then, this nodule presented a rapid augmentation of its volume with adhesion to both superficial and deep plans, and inflammatory opposite signs. Mammography showed an ACR5 lesion measuring 4 cm long axis. We realized a fine-needle aspiration cytology, a spread on slides and stained with May-Gr√ºnwald Giemsa (MGG) which showed isolated carcinomatous cells, sometimes forming three-dimensional clusters. Their nucleus is large and irregular with nucleolus. The cytoplasm is abundant. We did not observe myoepithelial cells and the background is necrotic and hemorrhagic. A biopsy of the tumor was performed. It objectified after Hematoxylin Eosin saffron Staining (HES) staining, a carcinomatous proliferation forming clusters and cellular cords. The tumor cells showed a large and irregular nucleus with prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm, sometimes eosinophilic and granular, and sometimes micro-vesicular. Cytoplasmic borders are clear. The number of mitoses was estimated at 7 per 10 fields. An immunohistochemical study showed that tumor cells express GCDFP-15, but do not express estrogenic and progesterone receptors, nor Her 2. The diagnosis of apocrine carcinoma of the breast is made. The staging has objectified the presence of lung metastases. The patient received palliative chemotherapy. He died after 8 months of evolution."
