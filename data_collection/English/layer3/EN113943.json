  "text": "In the present case, a 27-year-old patient with a history of amenorrhea, lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding received a laparoscopic dissection of cystic mass of the right ovary according to an initial diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Primary choriocarcinoma of the ovary was diagnosed by pathology, but its origin was uncertain. DNA polymorphic analysis was then performed and a gestational origin was confirmed. The patient subsequently exhibited an excellent response to chemotherapy, achieved complete remission and gave birth to a healthy baby."
