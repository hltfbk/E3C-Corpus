  "text": "A 48-year-old Sri Lankan Moorish woman presented with a 6-month history of ulcerating bilateral breast lumps, a 3-month history of non-healing painful ulcers on the palate, and sudden bilateral painless loss of vision. Retinoscopy confirmed left-sided retinal hemorrhages and bilateral panuveitis. An examination of her respiratory system showed bilateral coarse crepitations. Histologic examination of the palatal and breast lesions showed chronic granulomatous inflammation. Her levels of immune markers were elevated but her renal function was normal. Chest radiography showed bilateral mid-zone and lower-zone infiltrates with cavitation and small pleural effusions. Her serum proteinase 3 anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titer and the level of adenosine deaminase in her pleural fluid were significantly elevated. She was diagnosed with generalized granulomatosis with polyangiitis complicated with probable pulmonary tuberculosis, and was started on methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide pulse therapy with anti-tuberculous treatment. She later developed cerebral vasculitis, indicating refractory disease, and was treated with second-line rituximab with excellent response."
