  "text": "A 49-year-old female slipped and fell down while walking. She was hospitalized with a moderate headache and undisturbed mental state. The patient recalled that the force bearing point was her occipital region. Physical examination and computed tomography (CT) on admission showed right isolated ptosis and mild contusion and laceration in the bilateral frontal cortex. Further radiological investigation revealed nothing remarkable except for a fracture of the superior portion of the right medial orbital wall. She was managed conservatively and recovered completely in two months."
