  "text": "A 27-year-old woman was discovered to have a giant retroperitoneal tumor incidentally during her routine obstetric examination at 16 weeks of gestation. The en bloc resection was performed with preservation of the fetus at 20 weeks of gestation and the final pathology was consistent with low-grade myxoid liposarcoma. The patient had an uneventful pregnancy course with a termed delivery. A CT scan was taken 6 months following the surgery, and no local recurrence was detected."
