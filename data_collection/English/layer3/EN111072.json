  "text": "A South African female of mixed ancestry heritage, aged 4â€‰years, was referred for dental assessment to the Faculty of Dentistry, University of the Western Cape, in 2018. She had a diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome confirmed by a Medical Geneticist from the Division of Molecular Biology and Human Genetics at the University of Stellenbosch. The patient had a long prior history of health and developmental problems, with the correct diagnosis becoming apparent over time. She presented with many oral and craniofacial features warranting consideration by the dentist including micrognathia, hypoplastic nasal bones, cranial nerve dysfunction, bruxism, craniofacial anomalies and compromised sensory perception. The treatment was mainly preventive and, although she fed through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube (PEG), maintenance of her oral hygiene was necessitated."
