  "text": "A 22-year-old male known case of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia presented with bilateral shepherd's crook deformity of the proximal femur. Preoperatively, neck-shaft angle was 15째 on the right side and 55째 on the left side. The patient had severe pain on the right side due to an impending neck of femur fracture. On the right side, we first did a valgus osteotomy in the subtrochanteric region and fixed with dynamic hip screw, and after 3 months, the left proximal femur valgus osteotomy with dynamic hip screw fixation was done. Postoperatively, we achieved a neck-shaft angle of 140째 on the right side and 135째 on the left side. 1-year follow-up imaging showed union at both the osteotomy sites. At present, at 12-month post-operative, the patient is walking full weight-bearing without support, no apparent shortening."
