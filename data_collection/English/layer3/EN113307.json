  "text": "We report the case of a 52-year-old black man who was referred to our centre for the management of cellulitis and suppurating ulcers of the right leg which had progressed to a wet gangrene. Following physical examination and work-up, a diagnosis of fulminant necrotizing fasciitis of the right leg caused by multidrug resistant Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli was made. Despite the broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic therapy and aggressive multiple surgical debridement, necrosis progressed leading to an above-knee amputation."
