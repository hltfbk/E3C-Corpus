  "text": "We present two Arab patients with pancreatic long-standing insulinoma. Both patients presented episodic hypoglycemic symptoms respectively during 10 and 2 years. Biochemical and morphological workup detected localized pancreatic insulinoma. Open procedure surgery was done for the two patients and insulinomas were successfully removed by enucleation."
