  "text": "A 40-year-old right lady presented with pain in right hand due to fall on out stretched hand. The radial half of wrist and lower forearm were swollen. Tenderness over trapezium and 1st metacarpal base with terminal thumb movements restricted. X-Ray revealed undisplaced incomplete coronal fracture of the trapezium. CT scan confirmed coronal split fracture of the trapezium with a major volar fragment and a dorsal fragment without articular involvement. The patient refused operative intervention. Fracture was treated conservatively. The follow-up radiographs showed normal articular relationship of the trapezium with the base of first metacarpal and scaphoid. The fracture healed with no complications."
