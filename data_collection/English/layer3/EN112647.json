  "text": "A 63-year-old patient felt serious dyspnea diagnosis as TM caused by the recurrent cervical schwannoma. The narrowest diameter of the TM was only 0.446 cm and the length of malacic segment was 7.47 cm. Here we designed a novel tracheal suspension technique by using autogenous rib cartilage graft to treat severe TM. The obvious effect was observed that the inner diameter increased from 0.446 cm to 1.390 cm,and the airway symptom was alleviated."
