  "text": "A 35-year- old Indian lady operated previously for fibroadenoma of the right breast presented with a recurrent lump at the same site. She had a strong family history of breast carcinoma. Mammography and trucut biopsy was suggestive of infiltrating duct carcinoma. She was managed by lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection with a satisfactory outcome. There was no evidence of BRCA-1, BRCA-2 mutation on immunohistochemistry."
