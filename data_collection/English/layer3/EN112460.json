  "text": "We present an 84- year- old woman with a tumour formation located next to the left cricothyroid area. The lymph node ultrasonography performed during the hospitalisation revealed the presence of an enlarged lymph node in the upper third of m. Sternocleidomastoideus. The initial ultrasound data of the lymph nodes were in the direction of an inflammatory rather than a metastatic process. Therefore 5 days of therapy with Ceftriaxone x 2 g/day was conducted. The nodular tumour formation was surgically removed by radical elliptic excision. The subsequent histological study found that it was Stage II basal cell carcinoma (T2N0M0). A surgeon's consultation was conducted due to a patient's complaint about abdominal pain, and clinical evidence of a hernia inguinalis incarcerata was established for which the patient was urgently transferred to a surgical ward. Two weeks after the antibiotic treatment, a control echography of the enlarged lymph node in the area of m. Sternocleidomastoideus was performed, which showed complete involution of the lymph node."
