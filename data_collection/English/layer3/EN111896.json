  "text": "In December 2016, a 55-year-old Chinese male was diagnosed with stage IB lung adenosquamous carcinoma and treated with left lower lobectomy and 4 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. After being disease-free for 3.5 months, three colonic polyps were discovered and were diagnosed as invasive adenocarcinoma after polypectomy. Within 5.4 months from the polypectomy, squamous cell renal carcinoma was identified and was managed by radical nephrectomy. Immunohistochemistry results were inconclusive on the origin of the kidney tumor. Hence, the three archived surgical tissue samples were sequenced using a targeted panel with 520 cancer-related genes. Analysis revealed similar mutational signature between the lung and kidney tumors and a distinct mutational profile for the colon tumor, suggesting that the lung and colon malignancies were primary tumors, while the kidney tumor originated from the lung, revealing a diagnosis of metastatic double primary cancer - lung carcinoma with renal cell metastasis and second primary colon carcinoma."
