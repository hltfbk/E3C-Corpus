  "text": "Case 1 The first patient was a 15-year-old boy with no family history of TB. He suffered chronic snoring since the age of six. He presented with headache, asthenia and weight loss. Examination on admission revealed multiple bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies in jugular areas. Nasal endoscopy discovered a polypoid mass occupying the nasopharynx. A biopsy was performed. Computed Tomography (CT) showed a polypoid thickening of the posterior wall and the roof of the nasopharynx, measuring 2.5cm with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies in jugular areas. Case 2 The second patient was a 17-year-old girl without family history of TB. She presented with numerous bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies and nasal obstruction. Nasal endoscopy found a polypoid uprising of the superior and posterior nasopharyngeal walls. CT scan showed a nasopharyngeal mass with central hypodensity suggesting tissue necrosis, with multiple cervical lymphadenopathies. A biopsy was performed. Case 3 A 22-year-old man without past medical history was hospitalized for nasal obstruction with purulent rhinorrhea lasting for three months. Clinical examination found congestive nasal mucosa, purulent postnasal drip and a bilateral secretory otitis media with an average hearing loss of 25 dB, cervical palpation did not find any lymphadenopathy. Endoscopy objectified the presence of a tumor occupying substantially all of the nasopharynx, with irregular surface, covered with mucopurulent secretions and obstructing both choanae. CT scan showed a mass taking all the walls of the cavum without bone lysis. A biopsy was performed. Case 4 A 45 years old patient, chronic smoker, presented with unilateral lymphadenopathy gradually increasing in size with weight loss, associated with nasal obstruction and hearing loss of the right ear. Clinical examination found a painless firm lymphadenopathy of the right jugular era measuring 3cm and a secretory otitis media. The endoscopy found a tumor in the right posterolateral wall of the nasopharynx. CT scan showed a mass in the posterior wall of the nasopharynx with retropharyngeal lymphadenopathies. A biopsy was performed. In four cases, histopathological study showed nasopharyngitis and granulomas with histiocytic, epithelioid, and giant multinucleated Langhans cells as well as caseous necrosis. Further examinations searching for other locations were negative confirming the diagnosis of primary nasopharyngeal tuberculosis. All patients received anti bacillary treatment based on rifampicin 10mg/kg/day, isoniazid 5mg/kg/day, pyrazinamide 20mg/kg/day during 2 months followed by rifampicin and isoniazid during 4 months. A clinical, endoscopic and histological surveillance was implemented and the evolution was favorable in all cases."
