  "text": "A 40-year-old woman suffered missing upper right first molar. Implant stability quotient and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) were used to evaluate the diagnosis. CBCT showed insufficient posterior maxillary bone with a mean residual alveolar bone height of only 3.5 mm. The patient underwent a minimally invasive sinus floor elevation endoscopically. The sinus membrane was elevated in two stages, and a 12-mm implant was placed immediately. At 3 mo postoperatively, the final impressions were accomplished, and a full-ceramic crown was fit-placed. A 6-mo follow-up demonstrated satisfactory aesthetic and functional results."
