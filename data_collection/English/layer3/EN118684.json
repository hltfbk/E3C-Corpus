  "text": "An 85 year old lady presented to us with acute abdomen. She was on Warfarin and was found to have grossly deranged clotting parameters. Computed Tomography Scan revealed a long loop of markedly thick-walled proximal jejunum. A diagnosis of spontaneous intramural jejunal haematoma was made."
