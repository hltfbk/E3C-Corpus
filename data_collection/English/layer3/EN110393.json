  "text": "A 32-year-old HIV-negative patient consults the department for an ulcer-budding swelling in her left knee that has been evolving for 2 months. The antecedents are marked by a bifocal Buruli ulcer (knee and hand) cured for about 10 years leaving room for a retractile and deforming limb scar. The examination revealed a large swelling of about ten centimeters in diameter, ulcero-budding with a cauliflower aspect bleeding easily on contact with the sore edges, painful, sitting on the outer anterolateral aspect of the knee left. The peri-lesional skin was normal in appearance. Inguinal lymphadenopathy was noticeable, moving about two centimeters in diameter. Biology has found hypochromic normocytic anemia. Histology has revealed a proliferation of atypical squamous cells (large hyperchromatic nuclei, numerous mitoses) in invasive lobules, associated with disorders of keratinization. Finally the tumor stroma is inflammatory. X-ray of the knee showed bone lysis. The diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma being retained without metastasis, resection of the tumor with scarring after one month without chemotherapy. There was no recurrence after six months of decline."
