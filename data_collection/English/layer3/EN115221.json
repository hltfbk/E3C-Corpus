  "text": "We report an unusual case of a Japanese 13-year-old boy who presented with a 1-year history of right elbow pain. The onset of pain was insidious, without antecedent trauma. On physical examination, the range of motion of the elbow was limited. Grip strength was reduced in the affected extremity. Incisional biopsy was performed and histologic findings revealed nodular fasciitis in the elbow joint. After tumor excision, a secondary aneurysmal bone cyst in the distal humerus developed. Endoscopy-assisted curettage and artificial bone grafting were performed. One year after surgery, a plain radiography showed no recurrence, and the patient returned to his daily activities without any symptoms."
