  "text": "We report the case of a 38-year-old Caucasian woman who had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure for treatment of obesity. She also had a past history of right lobectomy to treat a benign thyroid nodule. Another thyroid nodule was diagnosed after her bariatric surgery, so a new thyroid surgery was performed. Permanent hypoparathyroidism occurred after the second thyroid surgery. A Roux-en-Y gastric bypass resulted in important weight loss, but the preferential site of calcium absorption was bypassed. The lack of endogenous parathyroid hormone secretion due to post-surgical hypoparathyroidism abolished the physiological mechanism that compensates the reduced calcium absorption, which was a challenge for us to overcome. In this report, we describe our clinical therapeutic choices to maintain normocalcemia and normophosphatemia in this patient. Higher doses of exogenous calcium citrate, calcitriol and cholecalciferol were used, but hypocalcemia was still present. To improve vitamin D absorption with resultant improvement of calcium homeostasis, we speculated that adding pancrelipase to meals would increase lipid absorption and possibly fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamin D. Only after the addition of pancrelipase did the patient improve without weight regain according to clinical and laboratory assessments."
