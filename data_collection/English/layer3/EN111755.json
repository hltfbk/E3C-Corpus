  "text": "An 80-year-old male presented to the emergency room with symptoms and signs of septic shock; however, the decision making for diagnosis and treatment was difficult, as no clinical and radiological evidence supported key findings regarding the origin of sepsis. Although this patient eventually recovered after surgical drainage, we suggested that more straightforward diagnostic and treatment procedures were required in this patient to avoid possible critical complications. Through a retrospective review of operative findings, patient history, and microbiology, we found that the RA in this patient was caused by lumbar acupuncture, which is usually performed for the management of chronic back pain with long needles."
