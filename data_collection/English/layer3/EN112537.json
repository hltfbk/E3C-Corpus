  "text": "A 25-year-old male, presented with complaints of sore throat, nonproductive cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, and progressive dyspnea for four days. The patient had elevated troponins at presentation of 0.47 (ng/L) that peaked at 4.0 (ng/L). ECG showed sinus rhythm and ST elevations in leads V2, V3, V4, and V5. NT-Pro-BNP was 1740. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 37% and global hypokinesis. The rapid strep test was positive for group A streptococcus and C-reactive protein was elevated at 161. Cardiac MRI demonstrated an EF of 53% and edema in the anterior wall without delayed gadolinium enhancement. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronaries."
