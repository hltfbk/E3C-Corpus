  "text": "We report a 9-month-old boy with mHS deficiency presenting with unusually severe and persistent acidosis after diarrhea and reduced oral food intake. The metabolic acidosis persisted even after supplementation with sugar and alkaline solution. Blood purification and assisted respiration alleviated symptoms, but a second onset induced by respiratory infection several days later led to multiple organ failure and death. Urine organic acid analysis during the acute episode revealed a complex pattern of ketogenic dicarboxylic and 3-hydroxydicarboxylic aciduria with prominent elevation of glutaric acid and adipic acid, which seem to be specific to mHS deficiency. Plasma acylcarnitine analysis revealed elevated 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine and acetylcarnitine. This is the first report of elevated 3-hydroxybutyrylcarnitine in mHS deficiency. Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel compound heterozygous mutation in HMGCS2 (c.100C > T and c.1465delA)."
