  "text": "We report a case of a 53-year-old Caucasian man with a liver abscess and subsequent brain abscesses caused by Aggregatibacter paraphrophilus. The probable source of the infection was the oral flora of our patient following ingestion of a dental filling. The presence of a large patent foramen ovale was a predisposing factor for multifocal abscesses."
