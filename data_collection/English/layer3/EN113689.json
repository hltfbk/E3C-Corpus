  "text": "We report a case of an undetected retained drain fragment inside the knee joint of a 24-year-old male international kabaddi player, who remained asymptomatic for 5 months, when the residual drain fragment was removed arthroscopically. No such case has been reported earlier in the literature after arthroscopic surgery."
