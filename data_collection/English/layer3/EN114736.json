  "text": "A 39-year-old female admitted a hospital with left knee pain with flexion and extension. MRI revealed a cystic lesion along the PCL. The lesion exhibited slight but homogeneous hyperintensity on T1 weighted images. Thin septals were visible within the lesion. Arthroscopic examination revealed a mass lesion with a white fibrous capsule, located near the PCL. A gel-like liquid spurted from the mass upon puncture. The lesion was completely resected. Histological examination revealed loose connective tissue and fibroblasts with collagen, thus confirming the diagnosis of a ganglion cyst."
