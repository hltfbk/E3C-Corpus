  "text": "A 14-year-old healthy male child with previous history of recurrent lateral dislocation of patella presented to accident & emergency department with complaints of inability to walk or bear weight on his left lower limb after he spontaneously dislocated his patella while running on uneven ground. Radiographs revealed a laterally displaced and vertically rotated patella along its long axis with the medial patellar edge locked and dipping into the lateral gutter. Open reduction was performed along with lateral patellar retinacular release with medial patellar retinaculum plication, to achieve satisfactory patellar stability and patellofemoral tracking."
