  "text": "We report a case of a 35 year old woman who had mitral valve annuloplasty complicated by recurrent episodes of CPE leading to multiple mitral valve replacements (MVR). She underwent MVR surgeries a total of four times over an eighteen year period and had good functionality during most of this time while being on antifungal suppressive treatment. This is a unique case in terms of numbers of surgeries performed, the length of the follow up and the involvement of three different Candida species."
