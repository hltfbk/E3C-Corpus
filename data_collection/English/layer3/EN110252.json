  "text": "A 24-day old female neonate presented at the Children’s Emergency Room of the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, southwest Nigeria on referral from a General Hospital on account of persistent vomiting and high grade continuous fever of five days duration. The vomiting was described as projectile, post-prandial, non-bilous and of large volume. The frequency of vomiting was 4 to 5 times daily. Although the infant had not opened the bowel for two days prior to the onset of the illness, there was no abdominal distension at any point. Apart from scanty urinary output, the baby presented with no other symptoms. This infant was the first child of her mother - a 30-year old second wife, known epileptic. The pregnancy was booked for antenatal care in a secondary health facility at about 22 weeks of gestation. The prenatal and perinatal periods were uneventful and the mother could only recall taking routinely prescribed haematinics and anti-convulsants in pregnancy. From birth, the infant had been exclusively breastfed and adequately immunized. At presentation, the infant weighed 2kg, was febrile (axillary temperature - 400C), but was not pale or icteric. However, she was conscious and severely dehydrated but had no other systemic abnormalities. The initial diagnosis was Late-Onset Neonatal Sepsis with severe dehydration to exclude upper intestinal obstruction. The baby was admitted into the Neonatal Ward and the haematocrit, random blood glucose and serum electrolytes, urea and creatinine were within normal. Dehydration was appropriately corrected using intravenous fluids Normal Saline. Subsequently, the baby received maintenance intravenous 8%Dextrose in 5th Saline, intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone and gentamicin) and was placed on nil per os. The vomiting persisted despite management, but without fever. At this point, the possibility of IHPS was entertained and test-feeding was done but no epigastric mass was palpable. However, abdominal ultrasound scan revealed distended stomach with food and fluid residual, active peristaltic waves without emptying, thickened muscular pyloric canal measuring 7.5cm in length and 0.74cm in thickness. The typical “doughnut-shaped” appearance of the gastric shadow in transverse abdominal scan was seen. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis. Plain abdominal X-Ray in the erect position showed gross gastric dilatation. Gastric decompression with an open-ended nasogastric tube was commenced, maintenance intravenous fluid was continued with strict monitoring of fluid input and output with subsequent paediatric surgical intervention. Pyloromyotomy was done and the baby did well post operatively. She was discharged home on the 5th post-operative day without complications."
