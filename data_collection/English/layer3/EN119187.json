  "text": "A 54 year old gentleman was admitted with 3 weeks of abdominal pain and localised swelling over the right flank. Examination revealed palpable 'snake-like' tortuous, tender lumps on the abdominal wall. Past history revealed chronic non-healing venous leg ulcers, and varicose veins necessitating varicose vein ligation at a very young age. The ulcers eventually needed skin grafting.During this, current admission he was investigated and diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). CT scan, performed to search for intra-abdominal cancer, revealed absence of the Inferior Vena Cava with extensive thrombosed collaterals of the superficial abdominal and azygous veins and a congenitally atrophic left kidney."
