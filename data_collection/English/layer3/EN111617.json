  "text": "We here report a 63-year-old male with recurrent acute encephalopathy syndrome and autonomic nervous system damage syndrome characterized by sexual dysfunction and urinary and fecal dysfunction. Cranial diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) demonstrated symmetrically distributed strip-shaped high-intensity signal in bilateral fronto-occipital-parietal cortical-medullary junction. Electrophysiological test revealed that the main site of injury was myelin sheath in both motor and sensory nerves. Skin biopsy revealed eosinophilic spherical inclusion bodies in the nucleus of sweat gland epithelial cells."
