  "text": "We present a 52-year-old female diagnosed with right intrabronchial mass invading the bronchial wall and the extrabronchial tissues with lymphadenopathy. Multiple bronchoscopic biopsies were not diagnostic. Pneumonectomy was performed and postoperative histology revealed marked mucin impaction and bronchial dilatation. The pulmonary tissue showed areas of hemorrhage and chronic inflammation. The mass exhibited an excessive number of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and numerous histiocytes engulfing them (lymphocytophagocytosis). These histiocytes were S100 protein and CD68 positive. These features are consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease."
