  "text": "We report a 40-year-old Pakistani diabetic male complaining of 5Â days of bilateral eye pain, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, headache, and fever. A diagnosis of orbital cellulitis with intracranial extension was made. A computed tomography (CT) scan and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were done on the patient and showed unremarkable orbits, extensive sinusitis, frontal abscess, and multiple septic emboli. The patient was admitted and on day 9 deteriorated and died."
