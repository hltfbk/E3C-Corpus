  "text": "We report the case of a 36-year-old Caucasian woman with acute cytomegalovirus infection presenting with spontaneous splenic infarcts. Trans-esophageal echocardiography did not show any vegetations or mural thrombi. The patient was also found to be heterozygous for the Factor V Leiden mutation. Anticoagulation treatment was considered but ruled out since cytomegalovirus was the obvious trigger for thrombosis in this patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the third report to date of cytomegalovirus-associated splenic infarcts."
