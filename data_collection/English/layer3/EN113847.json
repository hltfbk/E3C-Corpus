  "text": "A 36-year-old male patient with severe, continuous pain and swelling of tongue for 6 weeks was presented to Goba Referral Hospital. The swelling was 2 cm by 1 cm, located on posterior central tongue, and frank pus oozed from the center of the swelling. He had associated dysphagia, odynophagia, and speech difficulty. He had no previous personal and family history of similar illness and tonsillitis. Gram staining revealed the presence of Gram-positive cocci in clusters. Pyogenic lingual abscess was the diagnosis. Treatment included incision and drainage with the administration of systemic antibiotics, which covered both aerobic and anaerobic organisms, and anti-pain drugs. The condition did not relapse in 6 months of follow-up."
