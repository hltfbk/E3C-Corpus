  "text": "We report the first pediatric case of bronchogenic cyst complicated by atypical Mycobacterium infection. This case describes a 13-year-old Caucasian American female with a large cystic lesion and extensive pulmonary involvement. Pathology studies revealed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, multiple nodules, and acid-fast bacilli. She was successfully treated with surgical excision and a six-week course of clarithromycin, rifampin and ethambutol. Other unusual aspects of this case include multilocular intraparenchymal cyst appearance, its turbid drainage, and late symptom onset."
