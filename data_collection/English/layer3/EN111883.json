  "text": "In this case report we describe a 75-year-old Han Chinese woman with bilateral lower extremities weakness, numbness, and fatigue for 1 week. She initially presented as primary hyperaldosteronism with hypertension, persistent hypokalemia, and an elevated aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio. An abdominal computed tomography scan with intravenously administered contrast showed a solid mass arising from her left adrenal gland. She underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery that allowed the resection of the mass. Microscopic and immunohistochemical staining, which were positive for synaptophysin, CD56, and vimentin, confirmed the diagnosis of adrenal neuroblastoma. Surgical resection of the tumor was done and no chemotherapy or radiation therapy was done postoperatively. She died from lung and brain metastases 22â€‰months after surgical resection."
