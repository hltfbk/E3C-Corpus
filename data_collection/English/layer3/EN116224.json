  "text": "Two females, a 60-year-old and a 73-year-old, came to our hospital because of progressive loss of vision. These patients showed no remarkable symptoms or signs in their eyes except visual acuity loss. Several ophthalmoscopic examinations, such as slit lamp microscopy and fundoscopy, showed no abnormal changes in their affected eye but magnetic resonance imaging indicated a massive legion around the optic nerve."
