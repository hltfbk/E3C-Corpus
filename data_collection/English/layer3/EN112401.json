  "text": "RC is a 62-year-old male who initially presented with rectal cancer and underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation prior to a laparoscopic low anterior resection with diverting loop ileostomy. He underwent elective reversal of his ileostomy and developed persistent postoperative obstruction. He underwent resection of the prior reversal site with normal-appearing dilated proximal bowel loops and collapsed distal bowel loops. He again developed an obstructive picture and underwent resection of the prior anastomosis with creation of an ileocolic anastomosis, after which he recovered well postoperatively."
