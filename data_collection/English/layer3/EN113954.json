  "text": "A 64-year-old white French man had monoclonal gammopathy of the immune globulin G lambda type; he developed a cholestasis and cytolysis with the discovery of a subscapular nodule. A biopsy showed plasma cells and, for several reasons, the decision was made to use the fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy strategy. After 20 months, he is asymptomatic and the immune globulin G component has completely disappeared."
