  "text": "A 17-year-old male adolescent with polydipsia and polyuria accompanied with elevated serum sodium level and low urine osmolality for 3 weeks was referred to our hospital. After admission, hormonal evaluation showed that his growth hormone (GH) was slightly elevated, and serum osmolality and glucose were normal. The fluid deprivation-vasopressin test demonstrated CDI. Imaging examination showed an obvious thickening of the pituitary stalk. Lymphocytic hypophysitis, sarcoidosis and granulation tissue lesions were suspected. After oral 1-deamino-8-Darginine vasopressin (DDAVP) and prednisone were administered for 2 months, symptoms were relieved, and he discontinued taking the drugs by himself. On reexamination, imaging revealed changes in the size and shape of the pituitary stalk, with thickened nodules. Then, a diagnostic biopsy of the pituitary stalk lesion was performed. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the definitive diagnosis of LCH. The clinical symptoms subsided with oral hormone replacements."
