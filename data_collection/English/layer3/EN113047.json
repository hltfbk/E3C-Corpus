  "text": "A 38-year-old female presented with a red left eye for one month. Physical examination revealed an inflammatory granuloma in the lateral canthus and a fistula with purulent secretion. Antibiotics did not ameliorate the symptoms. After we incised the fistula, a huge dacryolith (10 mm × 5 mm × 3 mm) was identified at the end of the dilated lacrimal gland ductule and was removed surgically. Histopathologic examination showed a hairy nucleus surrounded by lamellar structure. The symptoms were resolved in 2 weeks after dacryolith extraction. The formation of the hair-centered dacryolith might be associated with the patient's personal history of being a rabbit raiser for years."
