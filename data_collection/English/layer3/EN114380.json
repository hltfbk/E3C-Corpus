  "text": "A 70-year-old man with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) underwent PCI. A bare metal stent was implanted in left main coronary artery (LMCA) after balloon dilation. The procedure was performed without any complications, and the patient was discharged 5Â days later. However, the patient was unexpectedly admitted by ambulance with cardiogenic shock and new-onset chest pain the next day. Echocardiography did not show any wall motion abnormalities, but a large mass on the right ventricle outflow tract was detected. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a hematoma compressing the main pulmonary artery trunk and the right ventricle. The patient developed sudden cardiopulmonary arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successful. The patient died during emergent surgical removal of the hematoma. Large, dark red clots between the pulmonary artery trunk and aorta were observed. The suspected origin of the epicardial hematoma was blood oozing from the stent site in LMCA."
