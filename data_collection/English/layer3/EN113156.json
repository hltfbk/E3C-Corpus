  "text": "A 65 year-old man, who had been receiving immunosuppressive treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with vasculitis for 9 years, was referred to the Urology Department with a retroperitoneal mass. This was confirmed by computed tomography performed during treatment for pulmonary aspergilloma. Because it was not possible to rule out malignant disease (e.g., liposarcoma), surgical exploration was performed. Pathological examination revealed aspergillus hyphae with fat necrosis, and retroperitoneal aspergilloma was diagnosed and appropriately treated. The tumor did not recur subsequently."
