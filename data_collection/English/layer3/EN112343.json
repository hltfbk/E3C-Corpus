  "text": "Two patients with posterior circulation ischemic stroke due to spontaneous isolated PICA dissection underwent HR vw-MRI. The curved multiplanar reconstruction image reconstructed using three-dimensional (3D) HR vw-MRI (3D curved MPR imaging) is helpful to observe tortuous blood vessels such as the PICA because it can visualize the entire vessel course in a single plane. In this report, routine HR vw-MRI revealed only an intramural hematoma in both patients. However, 3D curved MPR imaging discovered the intimal flap which was not observed on the routine HR vw-MRI. Therefore, these two patients were diagnosed with spontaneous isolated PICA dissection due to the intimal flap that was observed on the 3D curved MPR image."
