  "text": "We report a case of a 51-year-old male having a swelling and an ulcer distal to the left knee later diagnosed with dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma of proximal tibial and fibular metaphysis. Although DDCS is a highly malignant tumor, no metastasis was found and the patient was treated with transfemoral amputation. Post-operative histopathology showed nuclear atypia, binucleated and multinucleated chondrocytes with spindling and neoplastic cells arranged in storiform pattern and giant cells which confirmed the diagnosis of DDCS."
