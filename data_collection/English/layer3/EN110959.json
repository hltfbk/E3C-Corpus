  "text": "A 61-year-old man was referred to our hospital for having suffered from painless gross hematuria for 2 wk. Multiple masses rising from the retroperitoneum and pelvis were found incidentally by urinary ultrasonography. Contrast-enhanced abdominal-pelvic computed tomography showed multiple well-defined hypodense cystic lesions without enhancement. The lesions showed no uptake on F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography images. Exploratory laparotomy was performed, and the case was confirmed as multiple cystic lymphangiomas."
