  "text": "A 45-year old man of Philippine-origin was admitted with a six-week history of progressive bilateral lower limb swelling associated with aches and occasional cramps while walking. He reported unintentional weight loss of about 10 kilograms (kg) in the past 3 months with a two-week history of intermittent fevers and one-day history of sudden onset of difficulty breathing which was initially only on exertion but on hospitalization was present at rest. This was not accompanied by cough or chest pain. He had been treated with several courses of oral antibiotics with little clinical improvement. The patient was known to be hypertensive for the past 5 years on daily Losartan 50 mg and Amlodipine 10 mg. He worked on a cruise ship as a welder for many years. On general examination he was found to be alert, dyspneic (RR = 30 cycles/min), desaturating to 89% on room air, and febrile (38.2°C) with a heart rate of 112 beats/min. The patient was moderately pale with scleral jaundice and bilateral pitting lower limb edema; an erythematous patch on the anterior aspect of the right leg was noted which measured around 4 cm x 3 cm that was warm and tender to touch. On respiratory system examination the patient had a normal chest cage with the trachea centrally located. Fine crepitations were auscultated bilaterally from the midzone to bases. On abdominal examination there was uniform distension with an everted umbilicus and mild tenderness was elicited on deep palpation of the right hypochondrium. The liver span was 12 cm and the spleen was not palpable. Initial blood work done revealed a markedly elevated white count of 31.4 K/μL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) of 6.0 g/dL, an elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) of 221.48 mg/dL, Procalcitonin (PCT) of 61 ng/mL and D-Dimer of 6.74 μg/mL. He had an elevated direct bilirubin of 23.32 μmol/L but otherwise normal liver and renal function. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 30 mm/hr. HIV was negative, as was blood serology and stool microscopy for Amoeba. An initial chest x-ray revealed parenchymal infiltrates likely of infective etiology and subsequent radiological workup showed metastatic abscesses in the lungs, liver, lower limb muscle and subcutaneous tissue as well as bone marrow changes suggestive of osteomyelitis. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed multiple non-enhancing cystic liver lesions with largest measuring 3.6 x 3.2 cm. Doppler ultrasound for both limbs were suggestive of superficial as well as deep vein thrombosis. CT-pulmonary angiography revealed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. CT of the brain showed only mild cortical atrophy. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and was placed on 10L/min of supplemental oxygen with a non-rebreather mask and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The initial antibiotic regimen included intravenous (IV) Imipenem with Cilastatin and Metronidazole. He was also empirically started on antifungal therapy on the suspicion of a disseminated fungal infection however, after the first dose of Amphotericin-B he developed an anaphylactic response and this was therefore discontinued. For deep vein thrombosis, he was initially started on therapeutic doses of subcutaneous Enoxaparin and then switched to oral Rivaroxaban. During his stay the patient reported complete loss of vision in the left eye. Fundoscopy and optical coherence tomography revealed features suggestive endogenous endophthalmitis. He also developed acute worsening of his breathlessness which was attributed to an NSTEMI based on elevated cardiac markers. Coronary angiography was essentially normal, while 2D echocardiography revealed septal hypertrophy with no regional wall motion abnormality. Blood cultures eventually grew Klebsiella pneumoniae which was sensitive to Ceftriaxone. He was given intravitreal Vancomycin 1000 mg and continued on oral ciprofloxacin for endophthalmitis. Gradually the patient improved, with resolution of fevers and difficulty breathing with significant drop in his infectious markers. After a 25 day stay in the hospital, he was discharged home and to continue follow up in his native country. On discharge we recommended IV ceftriaxone for another 4 weeks or until radiological resolution of the abscesses was detected."
