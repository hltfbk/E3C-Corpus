  "text": "A 26-year-old Japanese man developed severe progressive manifestations, such as massive ascites and hematemesis due to rupture of esophageal varices. After making several investigations, we diagnosed the case as Budd-Chiari syndrome. We first performed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty to dilate a short-segment stenosis of his inferior vena cava. The first percutaneous transluminal angioplasty greatly improved the clinical manifestations. However, after a year, re-stenosis was detected, and a second percutaneous transluminal angioplasty failed to open the severe stricture of his inferior vena cava. Since our patient had manifestations of acute liver failure, we decided to perform salvage living donor liver transplantation from his brother. The transplantation was successfully performed and all clinical manifestations were remarkably alleviated."
