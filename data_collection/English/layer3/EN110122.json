  "text": "We report a clinical case concerning a 45 years old man who presented an intracranial hypertension during 18 months. The clinical examination found a right side hemiparesis with a facial hypoesthesis and parinaud syndrom. The MRI showed a process of the pineal region, hypointense T1-weighted images and hyperintense T2 and FLAIR weighted images. The patient underwent a surgey via an occiptal transtentoriel approach with a large and partial resection. A solid part of the tumor and the capsule were deliberately left due to adhesions to the large veins in the region. It was a pearly tumor. The histological examination confirms the epidermoid cyst."
