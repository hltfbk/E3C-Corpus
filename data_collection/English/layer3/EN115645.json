  "text": "We report a 15 year-old girl with truncal ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria and myoclonic epilepsy as the main clinical features. Blood lactate and alanine values were increased, and coenzyme Q10 was deficient both in muscle and fibroblasts. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation was initiated, improving ataxia and nystagmus. Since dysarthria and myoclonic epilepsy persisted, a lumbar puncture was performed at 12 years of age disclosing diminished cerebrospinal glucose concentrations. Diagnosis of GLUT1 deficiency was confirmed by the presence of a de novo heterozygous variant (c.18+2T>G) in the SLC2A1 gene. No mutations were found in coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis related genes. A ketogenic diet was initiated with an excellent clinical outcome. Functional studies in fibroblasts supported the potential pathogenicity of coenzyme Q10 deficiency in GLUT1 mutant cells when compared with controls."
