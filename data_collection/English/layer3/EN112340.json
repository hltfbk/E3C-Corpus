  "text": "A 37-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital due to multiple brain metastases. An autopsy report revealed that the cause of death was anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive lung cancer, exacerbated in a short period despite treatment with alectinib. Necropsy revealed anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung, suggesting that it was involved in the prognosis of this patient. Based on the autopsy results, we reviewed the pathological tissue from transbronchial lung biopsy at the time of clinical diagnosis. The tissue specimen for clinical diagnosis in this case was a papillary adenocarcinoma. However, when this tissue was immunostained, thyroid transcription factor 1-negative and cytokeratin 5/6-positive parts were recognized. This result indicates that we could diagnose this patient as having had adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung."
