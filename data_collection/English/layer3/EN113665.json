  "text": "69 years old man presented with acute onset fever and was diagnosed as having dengue illness. On the 4th day of illness, the disease was progressed into dengue haemorrhagic fever and recovered uneventfully. Although he recovered from primary illness, his general condition continued to deteriorate due to new onset of features of parkinsonism. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electro encephalogram showed evidence of encephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis also revealed positive IgM antibodies against dengue virus. Then the diagnosis of post encephalitic parkinsonism following dengue viral infection was made and started on. He was started on SINEMET (carbidopa 10 mg and levodopa 100 mg) half tablet 6 hourly started. After 1 week of treatment he showed marked improvement and then patient was discharged with further follow up plan."
