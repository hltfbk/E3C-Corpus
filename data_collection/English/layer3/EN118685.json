  "text": "A 51-year old man presented with a 1-year history of recurrent pedal and abdominal swelling, and 6-month history of progressive dyspnoea on exertion. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large right atrial mass prolapsing through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. Patient discharged himself against medical advice and died about one hour after getting home while trying to stand up from the sitting position."
