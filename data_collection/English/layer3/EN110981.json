  "text": "This study presents the case of a 52-year-old female with a chief complaint of epigastric pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a well-defined mass with mildly inhomogeneous enhancement in the body of the pancreas. Endoscopic ultrasonography showed calcifications in the lesion, and a few small vessels were detected by Doppler imaging. The patient received a central pancreatectomy, and pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic hemangioma."
