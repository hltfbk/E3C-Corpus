  "text": "A 52-years-old woman with chronic lumbar pain and radiating numbness of left leg was admitted to our hospital and underwent a posterior lumbar decompression surgery. 10â€‰days later, the patient began to have dysfunction of excretion. CT and MRI were taken and epidural gas was detected, which compressed the dura sac. A huge pseudocyst encapsulated with high-tension air was found during debridement with no evidence of infection."
