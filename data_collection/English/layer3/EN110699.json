  "text": "We report two pediatric patients who developed tuberculosis after receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for thalassemia major among 330 recipients between January 2012 and August 2019. Patient A presented with pulmonary tuberculosis and patient B presented with lymph node tuberculosis mimicking post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder associated with Epstein-Barr virus reactivation. Patient B's condition was deteriorated, and shortly after the initiation of anti-tuberculosis therapy, the patient was found to have disseminated pulmonary tuberculosis. Patient B was also found to have tuberculous granulomas, an uncommon manifestation of tuberculosis causing severe airway obstruction. Both patients developed critical respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation; however, they recovered with almost full resolution of pulmonary lesions after multiple treatment adjustments."
