  "text": "A 4-year-old, neutered male, semi-feral European cat, with a 1 year history of chronic vomiting, was referred to the clinic. Abdominal ultrasound examination identified a hypoechoic focal transmural thickening with loss of normal wall layering and hyperechoic speckles at the gastric body. Initial gastroscopic examination showed a tumour-like gastric mass with an ulcerated depression at the level of the greater curvature. Histologic examination of endoscopic biopsy specimens was consistent with a severe lymphoplasmacytic gastritis. After 2 months, due to persistence of abdominal discomfort, surgical exploration and intraoperative sampling of gross abnormalities was recommended. Full thickness gastric wall biopsies, and fine needle aspiration of the gastric thickening and gastric lymph node, were performed. Histopathological examination identified a transmural pyogranulomatous gastritis. Aspirate samples of the gastric wall cultured positive, with colony morphology, biochemical testing and PCR of the 16 s rRNA gene compatible with Actinomyces hordeovulneris. After 4 months of treatment with cefovecin (8 mg/kg subcutaneously every 14 days), the vomiting completely resolved, as well as the ultrasonographic gastric alteration."
