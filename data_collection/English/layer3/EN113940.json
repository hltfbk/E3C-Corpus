  "text": "In the first case, a 23-year-old male patient with jaw deformity was scheduled to undergo maxillary alveolar osteotomy. After intubation, auscultation indicated a sudden decrease in breath sounds, together with severe hypotension. Approximately 10 min later, flushing of the skin and urticaria on the thigh appeared and spread widely throughout the body. In the second case, a 21-year-old female patient with jaw deformity was scheduled to undergo maxillomandibular osteotomy. Twenty minutes after the start of dextran infusion, her lungs suddenly became difficult to ventilate, and oxygen saturation decreased to 90%. Approximately 15 min later, flushing of the skin and urticaria were observed."
