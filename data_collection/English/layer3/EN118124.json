  "text": "We report here the unusual case of a 47-year-old woman with NF1 who presented menorrhagias and a hard, tender pelvic mass composed of uterine leiomyomas. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography disclosed an area of increased 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the upper right part of the mass that raised the suspicion of malignancy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed numerous intramural leiomyomas ranging from 1 to 6 cm, including a 6-cm submucosal leiomyoma that had abundant cellularity, matching FDG uptake. Abdominal hysterectomy was performed and microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis of multiple benign smooth muscle tumours (uterine leiomyomatosis)."
