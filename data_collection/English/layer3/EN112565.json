  "text": "Here, we report the first case of genetically diagnosed GSS disease in Northeast China. The patient exhibited typical ataxia and dysarthria 2.5 years after symptom onset. However, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord revealed a normal anatomy. Screening results for the spinocerebellar ataxia gene were also negative. We thus proposed to expand the scope of genetic screening to include over 200 mutations that can cause ataxia. A final diagnosis of GSS was presented and the patient was followed for more than 3.5 years, during which we noted imaging abnormalities. The patient gradually exhibited decorticate posturing and convulsions. We recommended administration of oral sodium valproate, which resolved the convulsions."
