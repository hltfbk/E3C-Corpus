  "text": "In this report, we present the case of a 27-year-old female with stem breakage of tumor prosthesis and do revision surgery for prosthetic failure. In the case of revision surgery, autologous bone and Neobone were mixed, and this was transplanted to stem circumference. The Radiological Evaluation System of the ISOLS showed excellent results for all items. She can walk without using a cane or orthosis, and the score of the MSTS is 80%."
