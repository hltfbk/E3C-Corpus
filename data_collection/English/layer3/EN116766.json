  "text": "A patient presented with vaginal spotting around 23 weeks. She has a history of four preterm deliveries. Her cervix was dilated and a cerclage was placed. She presented again with PPROM around 25 weeks. She went into spontaneous preterm labor and delivered a viable fetus that is a healthy girl today. Eventually the pathology of the placenta showed a complete hydatidiform mole."
