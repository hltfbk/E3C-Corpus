  "text": "A 60-year-old East Asian male presented with complaints of epigastric distention and right shoulder pain. Laboratory tests showed HBV infection, HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) slightly elevated (21 IU/mL) and serum AFP markedly elevated (12,310 ng/mL). Computed tomography (CT) scan found a large and irregular mass in the left lobe of the liver. The patient underwent the left hepatic lobe resection. Histopathological examination showed chronic hepatitis B in the background liver and the immunohistochemical (IHC) findings strongly supported the diagnosis of ICC with aberrant expression of AFP. Serum AFP and HBV DNA declined to normal level postoperatively. The patient received four cycles of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin and took entecavir to prevent HBV reactivation. The patient kept disease free for 18 months in the latest follow-up."
