  "text": "A 56-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a best-corrected visual acuity of 6/6-1 in her right eye and 6/24 in her left. Fundal examination revealed pathological myopia in both eyes and an elevated lesion associated with pre-retinal haemorrhage in the left macula. Ocular coherence tomography and fundus fluorescein angiogram confirmed a subfoveal classic choroidal neovascularisation membrane. The patient decided to proceed with intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg) therapy. One month after treatment, best-corrected visual acuity improved to 6/12 in her left eye, with complete resolution subretinal fluid on ocular coherence tomography. After three months, best-corrected visual acuity further improved to 6/9, which was maintained up to 16 months post-treatment."
