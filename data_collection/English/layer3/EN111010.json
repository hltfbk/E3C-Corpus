  "text": "A 35-year-old man with a clinical course of progressive general fatigue and ataxia for 3 months was diagnosed with depressive personality disorder in another hospital 2 months ago and then referred to our hospital for detailed examination and further treatment. Blood test results showed hyperammonemia, indicating hepatic encephalopathy. Contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography and transarterial portography revealed a portosystemic shunt that connected the left PV to IVC. Endovascular coil embolization was successfully performed after temporary balloon occlusion testing and the placement of a retrievable IVC filter. After the procedure, ammonia levels gradually reduced, and his symptoms improved without any postoperative complications. No clinical symptoms were observed at the 6-year clinical follow up."
