  "text": "A five-year-old child was admitted to the paediatric emergency unit for seizures without fever. He was unconscious due to hypoglycaemia confirmed by laboratory analyses. At birth, he was a eutrophic full-term new-born with a normal APGAR index (score for appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration). He had one older brother and no parental consanguinity was reported. A slight speech acquisition delay was observed a few months before his admission, but he had no schooling problems. MADD was suspected based on urinary organic acids and plasma acylcarnitine analyses and later confirmed by genetic analysis, which showed previously unreported ETFA gene variations, both heterozygous (c.354C > A (p.Asn118Lys) and c.652G > A (p.Val218Met) variations). Treatment was based on avoiding fasting and a slow carbohydrate-rich evening meal associated with L-carnitine supplementation (approximately 100 mg/kg/day) for several weeks. This treatment was maintained and associated with riboflavin supplementation (approximately 150 mg/day). During follow up, the patient exhibited normal development and normal scholastic performance, with no decompensation."
