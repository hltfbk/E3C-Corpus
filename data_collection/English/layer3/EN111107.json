  "text": "Five patients (1 male) with CP (alcohol induced, n = 3; idiopathic, n = 2) who underwent laparoscopic Beger procedure from May to October 2019 in West China Hospital were included in this study. The median pancreatic duct diameter was 6.8 (4 to 12) mm. The median operating time was 275 (150 to 305) minutes without conversion. Only one patient (20%) developed a grade B pancreatic fistula. One patient required re-operation for jejunal anastomotic bleeding on the first post-operative day. The median hospital stay was 11 (9 to 34) days. No patient experienced biliary fistula, gastroparesis, duodenal necrosis, or abdominal bleeding. The 90-day mortality rate was 0%. All the patients were pain free in the two months after the operation."
