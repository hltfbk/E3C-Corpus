  "text": "An otherwise healthy 5-month-old female infant, the first child of two young parents without medical problems in their past medical history or a history of congenital malformation in their families, was admitted to our paediatric emergency department. Her parents complained about remarkable anxiety and crying of the patient the last two hours. The mother described that the little patient encountered difficulty in the bowel movements the last two days and had an episode of vomiting the same day. Last but not least, the parents referred that the child had a head injury three hours ago as a result of falling from a sitting position backwards on a soft carpet. On the arrival, the oxygen saturation was 99%, the heart rate was 164 beats per minute and the temperature was 36 degrees of Celsius. The child was first examined by a paediatrician who asked a paediatric surgery consultation due to the referred head injury. From the paediatric surgery clinical examination and estimation, the Glasgow Coma Scale was 14, there were no palpable or visible lesions on the head and the eye's pupils reacted to the light symmetrically. The abdominal auscultation revealed absence of bowel sounds, but no visible flatulence was present. From the abdominal palpation which was easily conducted, the abdomen was soft and there were not clinical signs of peritoneal irritation. The rectal digital examination had as a result an explosive evacuation of the bowel with diarrhea and was negative for blood. During the examination the child presented intermittent peripheral acrocyanosis and because of the quick deterioration of the clinical condition, we immediately catheterized a peripheral vein, took blood samples and tried to make a chest and abdominal x-ray. The mother accidentally breastfed the child while waiting for the x-ray to be done and spontaneously the child vomited and lost consciousness. The patient was transferred to the shock room without a diagnosis establishment because the plain x-ray was not performed. An anesthesiologist was called, the child was intubated and after the vital signs stabilization and a nasogastric tube insertion, because of the very disorienting medical history and the wide spectrum of the differential diagnosis which included both brain injury, undiagnosed heart disease and gut volvulus, which means that we could not focus our diagnosis on which pathology gave those signs and symptoms, the baby underwent an immediate full body computed tomography scan (CT scan). From the first axial images the diagnosis was established. The right chest cavity was almost completely occupied by loops of the gastrointestinal tract, which presented local thickening of their wall and fluid elements that misaligned the right lung resulting in passive atelectasis of the biggest part of the right lower lobe. Simultaneously, the CT scan revealed intrathoracic projection of the mesenteric vessels and a large displacement of the vascular structures of the mediastinum. The liver was intact, there were not any other lesions of the abdominal viscera and the brain CT scan was normal. The diaphragmatic hernia diagnosis was established and the patient was immediately transferred to the operation theater and underwent an exploratory laparotomy after obtaining the parent's informed consent. With a transverse incision in the right upper quadrant, we accessed the abdominal cavity and found a defect in the right diaphragm. The loops of the whole small bowel and the loops of the colon till the median of the transverse colon were gently retracted from the right hemithorax back to the abdominal cavity through the diaphragmatic defect. The bowel did not present signs of strangulation, the liver dome was misaligned to the medium line and the right coronary ligament of the liver was found hypoplastic. After the retraction of the abdominal viscera in their normal cavity, we aspirated approximately 150ml of serous pleural fluid from the right thoracic cavity and then inserted a chest tube through the sixth intercostal space. We then closed the defect of the diaphragm according to the Mayo technique and reassessed the retracted bowel which seemed to be normal. It must be underlined that a hernia sac was not found during the operation. We finally closed the abdominal trauma in layers and the child was transferred intubated in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in a stable clinical condition. The infant remained at the PICU for five days. The bowel sounds were present 2 days postoperatively and she had a bowel evacuation at the third postoperative day. The patient was extubated at the same day and returned to our Paediatric Surgery Clinic in good condition at the fifth postoperative day. During the hospitalization in our department the infant remained in good condition. The nasogastric tube was removed the day that she returned from the PICU, the breastfeeding started and was well tolerated apart from two episodes of vomiting the next two days. The chest tube was removed at the sixth day postoperatively and the intravenous antibiotic administration with a second generation cephalosporin was stopped. The next day and because of the association of diaphragmatic hernias with other congenital anomalies, a consultation from a paediatric cardiologist was asked because the other systems were checked through the preoperative CT scan. The heart ultrasound revealed that the anterior descending and the circumflex branch of the left coronary artery appear to protrude from separate orifices in the left atrium of the Valsalva, which is a finding of no particular clinical significance.The child was discharged at the seventh postoperative day in an excellent general condition and was then followed up at outpatient clinic 15 days, 1, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively. She had a full recovery from the operation, with no wound infections and without difficulty to thrive. At the time that this case is reported, the child is healthy and has not presented any medical problem associated with her past surgical history."
