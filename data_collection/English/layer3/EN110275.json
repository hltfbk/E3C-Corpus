  "text": "We report the case of a 20 years old patient trader resident in Senegal with no known medical history. He was admitted on August 2015 in the Neurology Department of Fann National Teaching Hospital for an abrupt onset of left body side weakness five days before admission. That weakness was preceded by acute headaches and rotatory vertigo without nausea or vomiting. Physical examination found paralysis of right oculomotor movements, right facial palsy, and left hemiparesis sparing the face which constitute the superior pons type of Foville syndrome. The brain CT scan shown spontaneous hemorrhage in the right pontineâ€™s posterolateral part compressing the fourth ventricle. Etiological investigations done to determine the cause of this hemorrhagic stroke remain non contributives. Patient received antalgic, anxiolytic, laxative and physiotherapy as treatment with clinical improvement. And he has been discharge 10 days later."
