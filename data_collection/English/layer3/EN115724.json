  "text": "A 59-year-old Japanese man with a 2-month history of keratitis was examined by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, in vivo confocal microscopy, and histology and cultures of corneal scrapings. The corneal scrapings were used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations of different antifungal drugs and also to determine the temperature-sensitivity. In vivo confocal microscopy and histological examinations showed filamentous fungal keratitis. The characteristics of the fungal growth indicated that the keratitis was caused by B. bassiana. The keratitis responded poorly to systemic and topical voriconazole and to natamycin ointment. However, it was resolved after changing the natamycin to micafungin combined with surgical debridement. The isolated strain was sensitive to itraconazole, miconazole, micafungin, voriconazole, and resistant to flucytosine and fluconazole. It was moderately sensitive to amphotericin B, and natamycin. After 7 days in culture, the isolate grew small white colonies at 25 °C, very small colonies at 35 °C and 37 °C."
