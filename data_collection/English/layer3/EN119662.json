  "text": "An entero-pouch fistula was occurred in a patient after radical cystectomy with ileal orthotopic pouch. Because of failed conservative management, the patient was candidate for surgery. The hidden small fistula in the small intestine was diagnosed by high intraluminal hydrostatic pressure (by intraluminal saline injection)."
