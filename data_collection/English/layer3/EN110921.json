  "text": "The patient is a 73-year-old Chinese male with a previous cancellous screw fixation for an undisplaced NOF fracture 10 months before sustaining another fall resulting in a subtrochanteric fracture. Radiographs and computed tomography imaging revealed a peri-implant subtrochanteric fracture with fracture line originating distal to the inferior screw at the level of the lesser trochanter.The patient subsequently underwent a Trochanteric Fixation Nail-Advanced Proximal Femoral Nailing System (TFNA, Depuy Synthes) fixation of peri-implant subtrochanteric fracture. Two previous cancellous screws (superior-posterior and inferior-central) were first removed to allow the passage of the TFNA nail which just skirted the remaining superior-anterior screw.Postoperatively, the patient was allowed full weight-bearing with the patient managing to ambulate with a roller frame support on the immediate 1stpost-operative day. The subsequent progress was uneventful and at the final follow-up 6-month postoperatively, X-ray showed complete bony union and the patient is pain free and walking independently."
