  "text": "We report a case of a 31-year old male with a high impact car accident. His pelvic ring and Hawkins II talar fracture were treated by open reduction and internal fixation. Rehabilitation was based on permissive weight bearing following wound healing. His fractures healed uneventfully and he was able to run freely, without any discomfort within 8 weeks. Radiological evaluation of the talus showed complete bone healing without signs of avascular necrosis. At one year follow-up, the patient is free of the symptoms."
