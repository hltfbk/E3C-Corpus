  "text": "A 66-year-old asymptomatic female was referred to our hospital. Computed tomography showed the presence of a well-defined mass with enhancement in the internal and peripheral areas. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and partial omentectomy. Histopathology revealed the presence of a papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from a 2.5-cm-diameter struma ovarii (malignant struma ovarii). According to the criteria of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the patient had stage IA disease. Subsequently, she underwent a thyroid scan with normal findings. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient was alive, in good clinical condition, and disease free."
