  "text": "A 15-year-old male presented with an acutely ischaemic limb. A computed tomography CT angiogram was performed which demonstrated complete occlusion of his popliteal artery secondary to a tumour of the distal femur. The patient underwent an open biopsy of the tumour followed by thrombectomy which failed to resolve the ischaemia. After further unsuccessful attempts at thrombectomy, angiography was performed which revealed a pseudoaneurysm. . The patient underwent a successful popliteal exclusion bypass using ipsilateral reversed long saphenous vein. The lesion was subsequently identified as an osteochondroma. The patient made a good recovery and at his latest follow-up is ambulant, free from claudication, and demonstrates good flow through the bypass on duplex ultrasonography."
