  "text": "We present a case of a giant adrenal myelolipoma in a 68-year-old Caucasian male, who was presented with left lumbar pain. Renal ultrasound, CT and MRI demonstrated a well demarcated mass, with a maximum diameter of 10-cm. The differential diagnosis comprised the adrenal myelolipoma, the retroperitoneal liposarcoma and the renal angiomyolipoma. Thus, the patient was subjected to a left adrenalectomy."
