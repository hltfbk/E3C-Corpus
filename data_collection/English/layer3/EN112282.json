  "text": "We present a 25-year-old woman with neurofibromatosis type 1 and a family history of the disease-father and grandmother with NF-1, with fatal outcome in the grandmother as a result of malignant transformation to neurofibrosarcoma. The patient has clinical data for multiple caf√©s- au- lait spots on the skin of the trunk, upper and lower limbs, and plexiform tumour formation in the seating area. From the performed imaging diagnostic there are available MRT data for 1) giant pelvic neurofibroma, 2) plexiform giant neurofibroma in the subcutaneous fat on the right thigh and gluteal fat tissue to the right, passing through the midline in the area of the external genitalia, leading to deformation of the front wall of the sacrum with bilateral meningoceles and 3) diffuse involvement of the bladder wall from the process in the area of the trigonum vesicae felleae/the two urethral ostium, as well as 4) the presence of neurofibromas in the course of the iliac vessels on the right. Surgical removal of the oval pelvic formation, identified as neurofibroma was planned, as well as the initiation of systemic therapy with Sirolimus for the plexiform sciatic formation, infiltrating the bladder."
