  "text": "A 55-year-old Brahmin man with no history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, presented with complaints of dizziness, headache, vomiting, double vision, and unsteadiness of gait for 2 weeks. His headache was sudden in onset, of a pulsating type and localized on left temporal side. Vomiting was projectile and bilious. Double vision was present in all directions of gaze and he had uncoordinated movement of his body and tilting to the left side. On examination, his cerebellar functions were impaired. He was thoroughly investigated for the cause of stroke after abnormal magnetic resonance imaging results with normal computed tomography angiography of his brain. Echocardiography and computed tomography of his chest showed a mass attached to intra-atrial septum and prolapsing through mitral valve, which was suggestive of left atrial myxoma. Five days following admission, he developed abdominal pain due to thromboembolism causing splenic and renal infarct."
