  "text": "A 95-year-old female presented with chronic blepharitis involving both the anterior and posterior eyelid margins. The anterior eyelid margins demonstrated pathognomonic features consistent with Demodex infection, and this diagnosis was confirmed with microscopy. Previous traditional therapies had been ineffective at controlling her signs and symptoms."
