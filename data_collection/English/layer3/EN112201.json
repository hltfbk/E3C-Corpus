  "text": "A 62-year-old male, presented with acute and severe abdominal pain for fifteen days. He was in pain, not pale or jaundiced. Abdominal imaging showed thick-walled gallbladder with multiple stones suggestive of calcular cholecystitis and liver cirrhosis. The diagnosis of acute-on-chronic cholecystitis was made. Following informed consent open cholecystectomy showed a cirrhotic liver with enlarged Calot's lymph node and thick adhesions. Histopathology revealed a benign GCT of the gallbladder. The patient recovered uneventfully. The patient was well with no tumor recurrence after one year follow up."
