  "text": "A 73-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our department because of disturbance of consciousness. Hepatic venous angiography disclosed a shunt between her left hepatic vein and her portal vein. The shunt was closed with the use of coils and N-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate. One hour after the procedure, she lost consciousness. The bleeding was ascribed to catheter-induced vascular injury. Emergency angiography was performed, and hemostasis was achieved with coils."
