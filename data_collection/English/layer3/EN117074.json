  "text": "A 50-year-old Greek man, who was on a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (nimesulide) for ankylosing spondylitis, presented with a right retroperitoneal hematoma combined with contralateral subcapsular renal hematoma. Bleeding on his right side was successfully controlled by arterial embolization with coils, whereas the left renal hematoma was treated conservatively. His recovery period was uneventful."
