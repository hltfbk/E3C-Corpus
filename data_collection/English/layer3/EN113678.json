  "text": "Case 1: A 51-year-old male developed spontaneous chest pain along right costal margin with a low-grade fever. High-resolution computed tomography chest revealed osteomyelitis of anterolateral chest wall. He did not improve with empirical antitubercular therapy, and subsequent debridement showed polymicrobial pyogenic infection which was managed with appropriate antibiotics elsewhere. Samples were not sent for fungal culture. He presented to us 3 months later, and surgical debridement showed growth of Aspergillus flavus which was managed with oral voriconazole. The lesion healed with no recurrence at 24-month follow-up. Case 2: A 40-year-old male presented to our institute with left-sided chest pain, low-grade fever, and loss of appetite. There was a history of injury with a sharp piece of wood 2 years earlier. Magnetic resonance imaging defined the lesion which was biopsied under ultrasound guidance. Cultures grew A. flavus which was treated with oral voriconazole. He had complete clinical improvement at 16-month follow-up."
