  "text": "A 55-year-old male with a 10-year history of a gastric subepithelial tumor underwent computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Two cysts were observed in the tumor, and the cyst wall showed moderately high intensity on T2-weighted images compared with the gastric wall. On dynamic study, the cyst wall showed a gradual enhancement pattern, and prominent enhancement was observed in the delayed phase. Laparoscopic partial gastric resection was performed, and a pathological diagnosis of PAMT was rendered."
