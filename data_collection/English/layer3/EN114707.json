  "text": "A 50-years old healthy white man presented with the complaints of headache, muscle pain, appetite loss, yellow skin complexion and fatigue. The laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes above 50 times the upper limit of normal and a positive antibody test and RNA for hepatitis C. A screening test 6 months earlier was negative and therefore the diagnosis of an acute hepatitis C infection was most likely. In the absence of spontaneous clearance of the virus a therapy with pegylated- interferon-α and ribavirin was initiated. After 3 weeks the patient developed red scaly papular skin lesions that evolved despite treatment with prednisone to a severe erythrodermia. A skin biopsy showed typical signs for psoriasis vulgaris. Treatment with steroids was intensified and the hepatitis C therapy stopped. The patient achieved sustained virological response for hepatitis C, but psoriatic lesions were still present 6 months after treatment."
