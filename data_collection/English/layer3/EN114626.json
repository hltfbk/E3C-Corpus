  "text": "A 15-years old male presented after 4 days of injury complaining of persistent pain in the right shoulder following a jerk during bowling. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left shoulder. There was pain on abduction and external rotation. The neurovascular examination was normal. Osseous avulsion of the distal tip of the coracoid process was confirmed by CT and MRI. The short head of the biceps and coracobrachialis was attached to the avulsed tip, while the pectoralis minor was attached to the coracoid base. The case was managed by open reduction and fixation with a 3.5mm cannulated screw and washer."
