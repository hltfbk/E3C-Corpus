  "text": "A 20-year-old female patient was admitted in the internal medicine service of Aristide Le Dantec Hospital for uncomplicated malaria. She was previously treated for autoimmune hemolytic anaemia using prednisone at 5 mg per day. Clinical examination showed swelling in front of the sternoclavicular joint. She presented with fever and headache. Thick smear from blood revealed trophozoites of P. falciparum at parasite density of 52,300 parasites/μl. The Ziehl-Neelsen stained smear showed the presence of acid-fast bacilli from the fluid puncture of the swelling. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was further isolated in culture. The diagnosis of falciparum malaria co-infection with sternoclavicular tuberculosis was posed. The patient was treated successfully using antimalarial drugs subsequently followed by multidrug antitubercular therapy."
