  "text": "A female patient aged 25 years presented with right lumbago for 12 mo, and pre-operative computed tomography showed a huge right adrenal mass. She received tumorectomy, and post-operative pathological examination showed adrenal PNET. After surgery, she underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and was followed up 31 mo after surgery. She received brachytherapy for right paracolic and hepatic metastases. She was alive and followed up for 60 mo. In available studies, only 57.14% (4/7) and 44.44% (4/9) were positive for the expression of neuron-specific enolase and synaptophysin, respectively, although CD99 expression was found in all the patients (100%; 10/10)."
