  "text": "We report 3 cases of abdominal tuberculosis in our Onco-gynaecology Division, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Sardjito Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia in 2018 which were previously diagnosed as ovarian malignancy and managed surgically. All of our patients experienced abdominal pain and enlargement but only two of them had significant weight loss. The general symptoms were typically found in onco-gynaecology patients, especially in those with ovarian malignancy. Ultrasound examination showed multilocular masses, 2 of them with solid parts and ascites. Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) levels were found increasing in those three patients. All of them were treated surgically and diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis was established through the histopathological result of tissue biopsy. Based on our cases and literature, we consider the need of a diagnostic approach to differentiate abdominal tuberculosis from ovarian malignancy, an attempt to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures that put burden risk for the patients."
