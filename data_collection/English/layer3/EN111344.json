  "text": "A 30-year-old woman of Han ethnicity presented with right epigastric pain at 28 weeks and 6 days of gestation. Examination by colour Doppler ultrasound showed the following: \"Twin live births with normal foetal umbilical artery blood flow indexes and a 183 mm × 112 mm anechoic zone in the right front of the uterus\". Initially, we made an incorrect judgement wherein we considered the amniotic sac that was protruding into the abdominal cavity to be an adnexal cyst. Fortunately, the diagnosis of uterine rupture was confirmed before the protruded amniotic sac broke. The mother did not bleed much, and the twin foetuses survived in our case."
