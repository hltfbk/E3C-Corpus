  "text": "We present a case of a 40-year-old male with co-incidence of NFH and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) that the mesenchymal components of NFH were similar to SCPT but these components highly expressed S-100 protein. We also discuss about the histological aspect of the neoplasia in this report and consider the findings of other reports in association with classification of NFH by means of cellular markers and morphological resemblance to other skin hamartomas."
