  "text": "A 71-year-old male was referred because of elevated serum pancreatic enzymes. Computed tomography revealed an unclear low-density area in the pancreatic body without evidence of tumor and mild dilation of the upstream main pancreatic duct (MPD). Other images, including abdominal ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging, did not demonstrate cancerous findings. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed a crab-claw-like obstruction in the MPD. Surprisingly, the component constituting the obstruction was moved by contrast injection and spilled out of the papilla orifice as a yogurt-like white object. Biopsy of this object by histology revealed a cancer cell clump. Pancreatectomy was performed, and pathology of the resected pancreas showed multiple nodular tumors replacing the acini and extending into the MPD. These neoplasms histologically resembled mixed acinar-ductal carcinoma."
