  "text": "A 21-year-old woman presented with left upper quadrant pain, the cause of which could not be diagnosed. She returned to our hospital, 2 days later, without any pain improvement. Enhanced computed tomography showed splenic infarction and polysplenia. Initially, we could not identify the cause of the infarction and started conservative therapy, which did not result in any improvement. Hence, we performed a splenectomy, after securing informed consent. Because the patient was a young woman, we opted for a laparoscopic approach. During surgery, we identified the cause of the infarction as spleen pedicle torsion; the infarcted spleen was excised using an automated suturing device. We completed the laparoscopic surgery without converting it to an open laparotomy, and the patient was discharged 4 days later. This was a rare case of polysplenia with splenic torsion."
