  "text": "We present the case of a 22-year old lactating woman who presented with four months of amenorrhea associated with signs of virilization. Clinical and diagnostic evaluation revealed a right adenexal mass and elevated serum levels of testosterone and she was diagnosed as having a stage 1A androgen secreting steroid cell tumor. In view of the early stage of the disease, she underwent right salpingo-oopherectomy. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis. Two months after surgery she regained normal menses and showed regression of the androgenic changes."
