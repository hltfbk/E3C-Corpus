  "text": "We highlight a young adult male who underwent a dynamic hip screw (DHS) due to a motor vehicle accident at 11 years old. He healed the fracture and did well for years. He was lost to follow-up and the hardware was never removed. The patient presented to our facility with a periprosthetic subtrochanteric proximal femur fracture just distal to the retained hardware. The DHS was removed and the fracture fixed with an intramedullary nail. The patient healed the fracture and did well."
