  "text": "A 58-year-old man was presented to our institute with complaints of posterior cervical pain persisting for 3 months, along with numbness and muscle weakness of extremities. A fat suppression T2-weighted image of MRI illustrated fluid collection in the retrospinal region at C1-C2 level, and an 111In-DTPA cisternoscintigram clearly revealed the presence of CSF leakage into the same region. The MRI also showed stenosis in spinal canal at C3/4 level, and a computed tomography (CT) myelogram suggested a blockage at the same level. We gave a diagnosis as intracranial hypotension due to the CSF leakage, which might be caused by the spinal canal stenosis at C3/4 level. Despite 72 h of conservative therapy, a brain CT showed the development of bilateral subdural hematomas. We, therefore, performed burr-hole drainage of the subdural hematoma, blood-patch therapy at C1/2 level, and laminoplasty at C3-4 at the same time. Improvement of symptoms and imaging features which suggested the CSF leak and subdural hematoma were obtained post-operatively."
