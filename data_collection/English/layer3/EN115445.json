  "text": "A 49-year-old male with severe uncontrolled asthma was referred to BT. One hour after the first procedure, acute respiratory failure occurred with PaO2/FiO2 < 300. A CT scan showed atelectasis of the right lower and middle lobes. A new bronchoscopy was performed under non-invasive ventilation; the right lower and middle lobe bronchus were occluded by bronchus-shaped plugs, that were very difficult to remove despite repeated saline washings and fragmentation with forceps. The patient had a rapid resolution of respiratory failure. Four weeks later, 6 hours after the second session of BT, severe bronchospasm occurred with respiratory failure. Chest X-Ray showed atelectasis of the left lower lobe, prompting to perform a new flexible bronchoscopy on non-invasive ventilation. The exam showed again a plug occluding the left lower lobar bronchus, removed with forceps and washings. The histological analysis of the plugs demonstrated the massive presence of fibrin with mucus debris, rare Charcot-Leyden crystals, scattered macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils and bronchial epithelial cells."
