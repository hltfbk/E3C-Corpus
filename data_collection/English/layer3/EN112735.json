  "text": "We present a 77-year-old man with a progressively growing tumour formation in the area of the right shoulder, clinically suspected for SCC. During the dermatological examination, it was found that the lesion was surrounded by an infiltrated, perilesional relief shaft, which was histologically verified as lymphangitis carcinomatosa. The tumour formation was removed by radical excision and formation of a large skin-subcutaneous defect. To correct the surgical defect, a cervico-pectoral flap was performed, followed by tunnel transposition of the scapular graft through the deltoid muscle. The preoperative, ultrasound-marked artery was the arteria circumflexa scapulae dextra, which was used as the foot of the scapular graft and at the same time ensuring its blood supply. After the performed surgical flaps there remains a small uncovered surgical defect, which was left for subsequent secondary healing or full thickness mesh graft. The subsequent histological examination of the removed tumour formation detected the presence of squamous cell carcinoma."
