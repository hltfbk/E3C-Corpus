  "text": "A 20Â year old Sri Lankan male who was treated for serologically confirmed dengue infection presented to us with 1 month history of bilateral hand weakness which has started 5 days after the dengue infection (5 days after the discharge). On examination he had asymmetrical motor weakness of the hands and to a lesser degree in feet. There was no sensory impairment. Nerve conduction studies confirmed MMN with conduction blocks. He was started on intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for which he showed a good response."
