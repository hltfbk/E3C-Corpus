  "text": "A 55-year-old female with breast cancer exhibited unexplained hypoxemia, followed with vomiting, diarrhea, unilateral flank pain and abdominal pain after lumpectomy 12 h. The urgent multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) confirmed the diagnosis of PE and RAE. Confusingly, the patient had no history of intracardiac defect, cardiac valvular diseases, atrial fibrillation or other cardiovascular disease and the definite cause was still unclear. However, after 10 days of prompt anticoagulant therapy in ICU, she was discharged in good condition."
