  "text": "A 47-year-old Caucasian male presented to the Sector of Oral Medicine \"V. Margiotta\", University Policlinic \"P. Giaccone\" of Palermo complaining of a mass on the gingiva. He first noticed the painless mass 1 year ago. He reported to have undergone allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 15 years ago for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Intraoral examination revealed a well-circumscribed, sessile yellowish and verrucous nodule upon canine, multiple yellowish and verrucous nodules on the hard palate, yellowish and verrucous nodules on left buccal mucosa. In addiction an area of white striae in a reticular pattern with erythema and ulceration was present on the dorsum of the tongue. This lesion was consistent with a known history of oral chronic graft versus host disease. Moreover, we observed a suspected area of oral erythroplakia yet on the dorsum of the tongue. In biopsy specimen of hard palate histopathological examination revealed a diagnosis of verrucous xanthoma of the oral cavity; in addiction in biopsy specimen of the dorsum of the tongue revealed the presence of erythroplakia with high grade dysplasia."
