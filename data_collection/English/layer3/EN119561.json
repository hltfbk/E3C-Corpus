  "text": "A sixty year old with primary sclerosing cholangitis, cirrhosis, and gallbladder polyps underwent liver transplantation. A polypoid lesion measuring 1.5 x 0.5 cm was found on the fundus of the gallbladder. Histological examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with full thickness penetration of the gallbladder encroaching liver parenchyma. Angiolymphatic invasion was noted. The lymph nodes, the cystic duct and the common duct were free of tumor (T3N0M0). Extensive evaluation did not demonstrate metastasis. No chemotherapy was given. He is currently six years post procedure and free of disease."
