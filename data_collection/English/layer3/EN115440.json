  "text": "A 38-year-old man with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus presented with altered mental status. A lumbar puncture revealed eosinophilic pleocytosis with a mildly elevated total protein and borderline low glucose level. CT revealed a left medullary and cerebellar infarct confirmed by MRI. MRI also displayed a diffuse marrow signal abnormality in the clivus with contiguous sinus disease. Endoscopic sinus surgery confirmed that the fungal sinusitis was mucormycosis of the Rhizopus genus, which had affected the left sphenoid sinus, invaded through the skull base, and involved the basilar artery. He was given liposomal amphotericin (500 mg i.v.) with posaconazole (400 mg i.v. twice daily). Due to the severity of the invasion and poor prognosis, the patient was discharged with comfort care measures."
