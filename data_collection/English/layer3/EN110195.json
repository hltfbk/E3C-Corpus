  "text": "A 50 year old Moroccan female patient of rural origin presented in Avicenna hospital Rabat-Morocco with history of pain and swelling of the medial aspect of the right leg for two years. The patient had been operated, in another hospital, three years earlier for echinococcosis of the subcutaneous tissue of the right leg with no adjuvant treatment. No history of trauma, fever and weight loss was reported. A painful mass next the previous incision was palpated on the medial side of the right leg; it was 5×7cm in diameter and there was no erythema and no sign of neurovascular compression, recurrence of hydatid disease was suspected. X-ray of the right leg showed an increased density of soft tissue in the medial aspect of the tibia. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) revealed the presence of a subcutaneous collection in proximity to the medial surface of the tibia at the junction of his upper and middle third adherent to the periosteum with a thick and scalloped wall, enhanced after gadolinium injection and fluid filled measuring 52×28×72 mm and a second deep collection at the tibialis posterior muscle measuring 21×9×38 mm sitting in front of the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries.\nChest X-ray and abdominal ultrasonography did not reveal any abnormality. Complete blood count and electrolytes was normal, ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test for echinococcosis was positive. The diagnosis of recurrent hydatidosis has been retained. A three stages Therapeutic protocol was carried out in: Preoperative Albendazole chemotherapy for one month was performed followed by a complete surgical excision of subcutaneous cyst with two-centimeter margin of medial gastrocnemius and intraoperative drainage of the tibialis posterior muscle cyst with hydrogen peroxide irrigation of its pouch as it was adherent to the posterior tibial artery. Pathological examination of the cyst confirmed the diagnosis. Adjuvant Albendazole chemotherapy was prescribed postoperatively for one year. At two years follow up, no sign of local or distant recurrence was noted and the patient sill under medical surveillance each six months."
