  "text": "In this paper, we report the clinical presentations, treatments and outcomes of five cases of invasive Neoscytalidium infections with cutaneous involvement, including two cases with disseminated infection, in five renal transplant recipients. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a series-albeit small-of renal transplant patients in whom this infection was identified. All cases occurred in a single hospital in Paris, France, between 2001 and 2011. Patients all originate from tropical area."
