  "text": "We report a 5-year-old boy, who developed general muscle weakness, constipation, ptosis and mydriasis during the third induction therapy for relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. He had recent histories of multiple antibiotic therapy for bacteremia and intake of well water at home. Repeated bacterial cultures identified Clostridium botulinum producing botulinum neurotoxin A. Botulinum toxin A was isolated from his stools at 17, 21, and 23Â days after the onset. Symptoms were self-limiting, and were fully recovered without anti-botulinum toxin globulin therapy."
