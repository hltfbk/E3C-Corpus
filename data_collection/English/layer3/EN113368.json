  "text": "A 64-year-old man was referred to the orthopaedic service with right hemidiaphragm paralysis. He had a previous history of asbestos exposure and polio and was initially seen and investigated by the respiratory physicians. He also reported intermittent neck pain and an MRI scan showed right-sided cervical foraminal stenosis. He underwent posterior right C3/4 and C4/5 foraminotomies, and by three months postoperatively, his hemidiaphragm paralysis had resolved and his shortness of breath had also improved."
