  "text": "Here, we report a case of a 63-year-old female with jaundice, who was referred to Shuguang Hospital because of abdominal pain for 1 mo. An abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a type I choledochal cyst and intraluminal masses suggestive of adenoma of the common bile duct. In addition, a preoperative diagnosis of a concomitant Klatskin tumor and type I choledochal cyst was made. The patient underwent anti-inflammatory therapy, followed by radical surgery due to hilar cholangiocarcinoma and resection of the choledochal cyst. Examination of the surgical specimen revealed a papillary tumor of the common bile duct, which arose from the malignant transformation of a pre-existing cystadenoma. Histologic examination confirmed a special type of cholangiocarcinoma; the tumor in the hilar bile duct was an ASC, whereas the tumor in the common bile duct was a moderately differentiated cystadenocarcinoma. The patient showed rapid deterioration 8 mo after surgery."
