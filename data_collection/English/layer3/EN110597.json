  "text": "We report the case of a 58-year-old woman with progressive low back pain for 3 months before admission. Radiological and histological examinations revealed L4 GCTB. The patients received 10 courses of denosumab, and the tumor was subsequently resected. The therapy resulted in reduction of tumor mass and replacement of the lesions with bone tissue, particularly at the extravertebral and intracanal mass lesions. Histological examination of resected vertebra revealed a notable decrease in the number of RANK-positive and cyclooxygenase-2-positive cells. However, few RANK-positive cells were present around the woven bone."
