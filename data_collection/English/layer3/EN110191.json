  "text": "A 18 years old boy was presented to our clinic with acute lower upper abdominal and back pain from emergency service. In detailed questioning he has confirmed a recentin crease in stool frequency without mucus and blood. His previous medical and surgical history was not significant. He denied a specific medical condition in his family. He was a non-smoker and a non-alcohol drinker. Usage of neuroleptics (antipsychotics such as haloperidol), other medications (such as tricyclic anti-depressants, or anticonvulsants) and herbals were questioned and all were refused by the patient. However, emergency service records have documented the usage of anti-emetics (metoclopramide 10 mg, im) and other medications (ranitidin 50 mg iv and Hiyosin-N-butilbromür 20 mg im) two hours prior to developement of abnormal cervical posture and muscular spasm on the left arm. Physical examination revealed acute dystonic reaction with right sided torticollis and minimal oculogyric crisis (upward and out ward turning of the eyes) were observed. These findings were observed to resolve after a rest of one hour in the bed in the Standard hospital room."
