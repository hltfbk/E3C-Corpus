  "text": "A 71-year-old man complained of bright red blood in his stool. Total colonoscopy revealed a mass in the lower rectum. Pathologic examination yielded a diagnosis of group 1. Computed tomography revealed swollen paraintestinal lymph nodes and multiple liver metastases. We performed laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection not only to avoid the unbearable symptoms caused by tumor growth but to make a pathological diagnosis. The tumor measured 3.5 × 2.8 cm, and the pathological diagnosis was stage IV neuroendocrine carcinoma. He underwent chemotherapy with irinotecan plus cisplatin, followed by carboplatin plus etopside, but his disease did not respond to either regimen. Twenty-seven months after surgery, he died of his disease. Upon re-examination of the surgical specimen, the tumor was consistent with the 2019 WHO classification of NET G3.6 CONCLUSION: A definite diagnosis of NET G3 or NEC G3 must be made to determine the appropriate treatment strategy for patients with GEP-NEN G3. Further case reports and case series are needed to establish the optimal therapy."
