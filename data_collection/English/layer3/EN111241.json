  "text": "A 59-year-old man visited our hospital in July 2017 complaining of a large mass in his neck. His thyroid function test results, including antibody levels, were within the normal limits. Ultrasonography showed a 4.7 cm × 4.0 cm × 3.2 cm solitary mass of intermediate suspicion in the left thyroid lobe. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy was subsequently performed. The pathologist reported a benign follicular lesion. However, the size of this nodule increased to 5.5 cm × 5.0 cm × 3.4 cm by April 2018. After a multidisciplinary discussion, a left lobectomy was performed in May 2018. The specimen showed a well-demarcated, partly encapsulated, soft nodule of whitish and tan/brown color on the cut surface. Light microscopy revealed high cellularity with moderate cytologic atypia. The mitotic count was 5/10 high-power fields. There was no tumor necrosis or lymphovascular invasion. The tumor was CD34-positive and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-positive. Neither thyroid transcription factor-1 nor cytokeratin expression was detected. The Ki-67 showed intermediate proliferative activity. The final diagnosis was extrapleural SFT of the thyroid gland with a clear resection margin. The patient was discharged without complication three days after the surgery."
