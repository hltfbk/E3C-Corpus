  "text": "Six cases of hemorrhage after bariatric surgery were described, including three cases with and three without abdominal drainage during the first surgery. The hemorrhage in five of the six cases was controlled by conservative treatment. Abdominal hemorrhage was found through the drainage tube on the day of the operation in the three patients with abdominal drainage during the first surgery. Emergency treatment was initiated, and their conditions gradually stabilized within 48 h. No patients required a reoperation. Abdominal hemorrhage was found later in the patients without abdominal drainage. Although the hemorrhage was controlled by conservative treatment in two cases (1 and 2), reoperation and percutaneous drainage were performed for abdominal infection and pelvic hemorrhage. An obsolete encapsulated effusion that may require treatment in the future was left in the abdominal cavity of a patient (Case 1)."
