  "text": "We present the case of a 40-year-old Caucasian man who presented with chronic pain and tenderness over his right hip together with functional impairment in abduction and external rotation. Radiology identified a bony protuberance at the right anterior inferior iliac spine with fusion of the proximal bony nucleus to the adjacent bone. The pelvic digit was surgically removed and the patient was discharged free of symptoms and with complete range of motion in his right hip joint."
