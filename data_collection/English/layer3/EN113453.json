  "text": "A 28-year-old woman suffered from intermittently lower abdominal tenderness and nausea after meals for 3Â years. The abdominal ultrasound revealed a right ovarian mass with fluid accumulation and the contrast CT of abdomen revealed a gallbladder fundus mass and liver tumor lesion located at segment 4. We arranged surgical intervention with radical cholecystectomy and debulking operation with salpingo-oophorectomy. The pathologic report revealed adenocarcinoma of gallbladder with liver, peritoneum, and right ovarian invasion. After surgical intervention, she also received adjuvant chemotherapy with Gemcitabine, Cetuximab, Cisplatin and Cyberknife."
