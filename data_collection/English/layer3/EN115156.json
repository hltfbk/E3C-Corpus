  "text": "We report the case of a Hispanic 64-year-old woman with cognitive decline and extensive leukoencephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed white-matter lesions with increased water diffusivity, without blood-brain-barrier disruption. Brain biopsy showed tissue rarefaction with vacuolation, mild inflammation, few reactive astrocytes and decreased aquaporin water-channel expression in the lesions. Six months later, she was diagnosed with atypical mycobacterial pulmonary infection. Brain lesions resolved after antimycobacterial treatment."
