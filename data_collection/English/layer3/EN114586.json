  "text": "We studied a 56-year-old treatment-naïve Japanese man with chronic HCV genotype 2b infection who had ulcerative colitis. This patient was treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks. During treatment, diarrhoea and bloody faeces were frequent. After ribavirin was reduced to 400 mg daily, these symptoms decreased. Finally, the patient achieved a sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the stoppage of the treatment."
