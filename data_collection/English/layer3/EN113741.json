  "text": "The case we presented was a 68-year-old Chinese female with metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma of the left breast 10Â years after a nephrectomy. Identification of the metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma in the breast required multiple breast imaging modalities. Imaging showed a single, ovary-shaped, well-defined hypo-echoic mass, with abundant blood flow on ultrasound images. The mass was enhanced early on MRI, and it was hypointense on a T1-weighted image and hyperintense on a fat-saturated T2-weighted image. Following surgical excision of the tumor, a routine immunohistochemistry antibody panel on the tumor cells revealed negative staining for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (Her-2). Strong positive staining for the cluster of differentiation 10 (CD10) and vimentin was present."
