  "text": "We are presenting a 51-years-old man with multi-infarct encephalopathy referred to us for an acute TBAD and a first diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy complicated by left ventricular (LV) thrombus formation. Coronary angiography revealed a critical stenosis of left anterior descending artery (LAD) treated with drug-eluting stent deployment. The patient was addressed to triple antithrombotic therapy with acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel and warfarin with target INR 2.0-2.5. After 6â€‰months, computed tomography angiography revealed the stability of the dissection flap. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, however, confirmed the persistence of a small thrombotic formation in LV apex, thus double antithrombotic therapy with warfarin and clopidogrel was instituted. The patient remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period but was advised to suspend his job and physical activities."
