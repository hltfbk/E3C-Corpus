  "text": "A 17-year-old cross-breed bitch had a firm, grey-white multinodular mass in the left ovary. The tumour was submitted to histopathological examination and Y chromosome detected through karyotype analysis and PCR studies. Microscopically, the ovary was almost replaced by an irregular neoplasm composed of three distinct, intermixed elements: dysgerminoma, mixed germ cell-sex cord-stromal tumour resembling human GB and a proliferative sex cord-stromal tumour component. The germ cells of gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma components were immunoreactive for c-KIT. Sex cord-stromal cells of gonadoblastoma were immunoreactive for α-inhibin. The sex cord-stromal tumour was immunoreactive for AE1/AE3, occasionally for α-inhibin and negative for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). The karyotype was 78, XX and PCR analysis confirmed the absence of the Y chromosome."
