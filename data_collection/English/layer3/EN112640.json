  "text": "A 28-year-old female presented with complaints of pain and restricted movement of the right ankle joint since 1 month. There was no history of trauma. On examination, tenderness on the anterior aspect of the right ankle joint with restricted range of motion was found. X-rays revealed a well-defined expansile predominantly lytic lesion in the distal epi-metaphyseal region of the right tibia with minimal periosteal reaction seen along the medial margin. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an ill-defined expansile lesion involving the epi-metaphyseal end of the lower end of tibia causing cortical breach and having extra-osseous tissue component with the abnormal signal in flexor and extensor group of muscles with the possibility of GCT. Surgery by excision, curettage, and cementation was performed to fill the defect. Histopathology of the tissue showed multinucleated giant cells with a uniform vesicular nucleus and mononuclear cells which were spindle shaped with uniform vesicular nucleus suggestive of GCT."
