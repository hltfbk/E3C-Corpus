  "text": "We herein report a case of a 32-year-old man with a cystic tumor in the tail of the pancreas. The patient underwent a laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy, and histological examination revealed the presence of ECIPAS. In addition, we also performed a literature review of 42 case reports of ECIPAS."
