  "text": "Case A is a 65-year-old Chinese woman who presented with abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, bloating and acid reflux. The enhanced abdominal CT scan found nothing meaningful except the absence of the body and tail of the pancreas. The diagnosis was considered as gastrointestinal dysfunction cause by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and recovered after symptomatic treatment. Case B is a 61-year-old Chinese woman who presented with abdominal pain accompanied by fever, vomiting and bloating. The abdominal CT showed multiple stones in the gallbladder, and the body and tail of the patient's pancreas were absent. She was diagnosed with cholelithiasis and recovered after laparoscopic cholecystectomy."
