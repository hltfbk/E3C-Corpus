  "text": "A 72-year-old female previously healthy, was referred to our teaching hospital suffering from acute abdominal pain located in the right hypochondrium 6 days before. The patient was giving a history of minor abdominal trauma six months back for which monitoring and medical treatment were performed in a peripheral health center. However, the physical examination revealed the presence of pain and palpable mass in the epigastrium and upper right quadrant. Nausea and vomiting, respiratory gene and moderate jaundice were noted on arrival at the emergency room. Laboratory tests documented leukocytosis (12000/mL) with neutrophilia. Hemoglobin, serum electrolytes, indices of cholestasis, liver enzymes, kidney function, lipasemia, amylasemia and blood glucose were normal. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography scan findings included a large well-defined intra-abdominal (right quadrant) collection overlying the suprahepatic and right subphrenic regions (max axial 15 cm), gallstones with extra hepatic bile duct moderate dilation without being able to identify common bile duct stones, and the inter-hepato-diaphragmatic fluid collection exerting a mass effect on the liver. In addition bilateral pneumonic pleuro pneumopathy and peritoneal effusion were observed. After percutaneous drainage and antibiotic therapy, control CT scan showed the disappeared lesion and the patient obtained complete resolution of symptoms. The drainage was removed a week later. One month later, CT-scan revealed cholelithiasis and the patient underwent cholecystectomy with removal of common bile duct stone."
