  "text": "A Sri Lankan girl presented with recurrent episodes of jaundice. She had conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with diffuse, coarse brown pigments in the hepatocytes. Urine coproporphyrin examination suggested Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Genetic studies confirmed missense homozygous variant p.Trp709Arg in the ATP-binding cassette sub-family C member 2 gene ABCC2 that encodes the Multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 that causes Dubin-Johnson syndrome. The gene study of the mother revealed the same missense variant in ABCC2/MRP2 but with a heterozygous status, and in addition a homozygous missense variant p.Val444Ala in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B member 11 gene ABCB11 that encodes the bile salt export pump."
