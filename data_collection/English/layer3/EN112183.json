  "text": "A 41-year-old man was transported emergently to our hospital owing to acute respiratory distress and hemoptysis. He was diagnosed with acute left heart failure caused by a large mass in the left atrium (LA) that obstructed cardiac blood flow, as revealed by imaging study findings, and he underwent an emergency open-heart surgery for tumor resection. He was pathologically diagnosed with UPS invading the muscle layer of the LA. However, after receiving combined therapy for local recurrence and distant metastasis, including proton beam radiotherapy and chemotherapy with molecularly targeted drugs, he could return to work for 2 more years after surgery."
