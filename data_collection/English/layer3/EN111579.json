  "text": "A 46-year-old man presented to another institution with acute type A aortic dissection with abdominal aorta occlusion. Motor and sensory grade of both lower extremities were zero. Immediate antegrade distal perfusion of both lower extremities was achieved, and total arch replacement with left axillo-bifemoral bypass was performed. At the time of discharge, motor and sensory grades of both lower extremities were 2 and 3, respectively."
