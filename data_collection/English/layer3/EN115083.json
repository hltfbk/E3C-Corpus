  "text": "A 23-year-old woman was admitted due to sudden painless visual loss in the left eye. On examination visual acuity of light-perception was noted in the left eye with a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Fundoscopic examination revealed retinal ischemic whitening, constriction of the arteriole and venule with segmentation and typical \"cherry-red spot\" suggesting CRAO. The patient was treated with ocular massage and anterior chamber paracentesis. She was commenced on 150Â mg of aspirin and also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy. An echocardiogram revealed PTA and single atrium. A diagnosis of CRAO associated with PTA and single atrium was made."
