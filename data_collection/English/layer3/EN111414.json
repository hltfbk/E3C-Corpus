  "text": "An 80-year-old man having refractory otitis media with effusion of the right ear presented with progressive right-sided headache and nausea. Post-contrast brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed right mastoiditis and remarkable thickening of the dura mater and enhancement of pia mater extending from the right middle cranial fossa to the temporal lobe. HP secondary to middle ear infection was suspected, and a biopsy of the right mastoid was performed. An anaerobic culture of the biopsied right mastoid showed the growth of P. acnes, and histopathological examination using P. acnes-specific monoclonal antibody (PAB antibody) revealed the infiltration of inflammatory cells with P. acnes. Moreover, using PAB antibody, P. acnes was detected in the biopsy specimen of the thickening dura mater. No granulomas were identified in either specimen. HP was resolved with long-term administration of antibiotics and steroids."
