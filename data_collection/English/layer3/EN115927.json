  "text": "A 74-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for a liver tumor. He previously underwent rectal amputation for a malignant GIST. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a low-density area in the liver and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (EOB-MRI) showed that the tumor was completely washed out in the delayed phase. 18Fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed strong uptake in the liver. A diagnosis of liver metastasis was made and partial hepatectomy was performed. Microscopic examination showed that the tumor was an IPT."
