  "text": "In this report we present a case of myositis ossificans within the serratus anterior which developed as a complication due to long-term nape massage. The patient was a 29-year-old Han woman. Because heterotopic ossificans constricted her brachial plexus the surface of her right upper arm was slightly numb; the symptom disappeared after surgery."
