  "text": "We report a case of a 24-year-old male who sustained a left-sided anterior subcoracoid shoulder dislocation following a road traffic accident. The shoulder was closed reduced, and a post-reduction radiograph was taken to confirm concentric reduction. At 6-month and 2-year follow-up, the radiographs showed sclerotic changes and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the occurrence of osteonecrosis. This is the first such report in contemporary literature."
