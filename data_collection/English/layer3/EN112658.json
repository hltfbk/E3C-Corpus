  "text": "A 46-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome showed relapse after HSCT and received a second HSCT. The patient was diagnosed with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD)-associated serositis because of persistent ascites. His ascites improved gradually and disappeared without immunosuppressive therapy. He presented with nausea, weight loss, and constipation 1 year after improvement of ascites. Computed tomography revealed no organic obstruction, but did reveal dilated, thickened, and adhered small bowel loops with a mass-like appearance. He was diagnosed with EPS on the basis of clinical symptoms and image findings. He received corticosteroid therapy (20 mg/body) without any improvement in symptoms. He developed recurrence of myelodysplastic syndrome at 1 month after initiation of corticosteroid therapy. This progressed into acute myeloid leukaemia after 3 months. He died 31 months after the second HSCT. At autopsy, the small and large intestines had formed extensive adhesions and showed signs of progressive fibrosis with peritoneal sclerosis, fibroblast swelling, fibrin deposition, and inflammatory cell infiltration, which confirmed the diagnosis of EPS."
