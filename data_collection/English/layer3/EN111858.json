  "text": "We report a 36-year-old woman who developed total colonic necrosis and septic shock secondary to UC. The patient was treated with emergency surgery because computed tomography showed suspicious perforations. Persistent massive ascites occurred after operation and computed tomography angiography demonstrated portal vein, mesenteric vein and splenic vein thrombosis. The patient was discharged from hospital after active treatment."
