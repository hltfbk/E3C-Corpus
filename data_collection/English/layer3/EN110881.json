  "text": "We report two cases. In the first case flexible fiberoptic Rhino-Pharyngo-Laryngoscopy showed epiglottitis that was obstructing the airway and abscesses on the lingual surface of the epiglottis. Abscesses were opened using laser CO2. In the following days flexible fiberoptic endoscopy revealed persisting protrusion of the left hemilarynx. A CT scan was performed showing an abscess in the paraglottic space. Under direct laryngoscopy the abscess was drained. In the second case endoscopic examination revealed epiglottitis that did not cause airway obstruction. The patient was admitted for follow-up and treated with intravenous antibiotics. On the 5th day showed an exacerbation of her symptoms. A CT scan was performed that showed the existence of an abscess in the preepiglottic space. She was taken to surgery and the abscesses were drained through a cervical- U shaped- incission."
