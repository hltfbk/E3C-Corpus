  "text": "A 69-year-old Sri Lankan Tamil man presented to our hospital with focal neurological deficit following multiple wasp stings; the deficit was confirmed to be an acute infarction on magnetic resonance imaging scan. He was screened for metabolic risk factors which were negative and he had a normal two-dimensional echocardiogram and normal carotid arteries in carotid duplex which excluded potential sources of thromboembolism."
