  "text": "We report two clinical cases of emphysematous cystitis of an 83-year-old Caucasian woman with diabetes mellitus and a 78-year-old Caucasian man with no past medical history. They presented with severe confusion and abdominal distension. Emphysematous cystitis was diagnosed in time with a thorough physical examination, urine analysis and computed tomography. The patients were successfully treated with antibiotic therapy and bladder drainage."
