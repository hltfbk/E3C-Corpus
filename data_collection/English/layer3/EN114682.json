  "text": "A 73-year-old female patient presented with metachronous colorectal liver metastasis comprising the complete right liver lobe as well as segment IV. Due to an insufficient future liver remnant (19.3 %; segments II and III of the liver) and a low future liver remnant:body weight ratio (0.28 %) the decision was made to perform an ALPPS-procedure in order to avoid development of postoperative small-for-size syndrome. Despite a formally sufficient increase of the FLR to 30.8 % within 7 days after the first step of ALPPS, the liver function was seen to only slowly increase as expressed by a LiMAx value of 245 μg/h/kg (baseline of 282 μg/h/kg prior to surgery). By means of the LiMAx test, sufficient increase of liver function eventually was detected by postoperative day 11 (LiMAx value of 371 μg/h/kg; FLR 35.2 %) so that the second step of ALPPS (completion of hepatectomy) was performed with no signs of liver failure during further clinical course."
