  "text": "A 24-years Japanese female patient was referred to our hospital for the flare-up of AOSD under the combined treatments with steroid, immunosuppressants, and biologics. She was diagnosed with AOSD according to the Yamaguchi criteria, based on the presence of spiking fever, polyarthralgia, skin rash, and hyperferritinemia. Interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor-α blockade treatments were not effective, the oral administration of colchicine was stared under the immunosuppressive treatments with steroid and cyclosporine A (CyA). Colchicine treatment silenced the disease activity of AOSD. The dose of prednisolone was successfully tapered, and the elevated levels of C-reactive protein were normalized. Remission has been maintained for 13 months with the start of oral administration of colchicine."
