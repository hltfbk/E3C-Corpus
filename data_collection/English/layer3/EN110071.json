  "text": "L.A 50-years presented at our institution with a painless mass in her left arm region that she had noticed about six months earlier and that caused no other symptoms. The mass was nontender and he recalled no antecedent trauma. On physical examination, a deep, well-circumscribed mass was palpated in the region of the left biceps. The mass was freely movable, with no overlying skin changes. MRI revealed a mass within the left biceps brachii consistent with a low-grade lipomatous lesion, likely an intramuscular lipoma. The patient underwent radical excision of the lesion, which was found to be 8 cm × 6 cm × 4 cm in size. Final pathology revealed lipoma."
