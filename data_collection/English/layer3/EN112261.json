  "text": "A boy aged 4 years and 2 mo was hospitalized for abdominal pain with nausea and jaundice for 5 d. Abdominal ultrasound showed cholecystitis with cholestasis in the gallbladder, dilated middle-upper CBD, and a strong echo in the lower CBD, indicating biliary stones. The diagnosis was extrahepatic biliary obstruction caused by biliary stones, which is an indication for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP was performed to remove biliary stones. During the ERCP, we found a rare communication between the CBD and dorsal pancreatic duct. After clearing the CBD with a balloon, an 8.5 Fr 4-cm pigtail plastic pancreatic stent was placed in the biliary duct through the major papilla. Six months later, his biliary stent was removed after he had no symptoms and normal laboratory tests. In the following 4-year period, the child grew up normally with no more attacks of abdominal pain."
