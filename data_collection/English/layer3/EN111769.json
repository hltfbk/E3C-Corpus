  "text": "A 25-year-old woman visited our hospital with abdominal pain. Computed tomography and endoscopy were performed, and a gastric submucosal tumor (SMT) with a size of 6.7 cm × 2.7 cm was detected, so endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle biopsy was performed. The tumor was not diagnosed histologically, so surgical resection was planned and performed. The histopathologically confirmed mass size was 6.5 cm × 4.0 cm × 1.0 cm, and a calcified fibrous tumor that originated at the gastrohepatic ligament and adhered to the lesser curvature of the gastric antrum was identified."
