  "text": "An 18-year-old male complained of the left shoulder pain and crepitus after a shoulder injury while playing hockey a year prior. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated medial dislocation of the LHBT without subscapularis or supraspinatus tendon injury. The patient complained of instability in the shoulder and exam findings supported posterior instability of the glenohumeral joint. Arthroscopic debridement of the glenohumeral joint with arthroscopic posterior capsulorrhaphy and open biceps tenodesis was performed. The patient regained full and painless range of motion at 2-year follow-up."
