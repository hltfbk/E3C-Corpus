  "text": "We describe an immune competent adult with a primary EBV infection complicated by lumbosacral polyradiculitis with pure radicular pain. Prior to the onset of radicular pain the 35-year-old woman had been suffering from infectious mononucleosis misdiagnosed for streptococcal tonsillitis. The diagnosis of primary EBV infection associated polyradiculitis was proven by serology and PCR in serum and CSF. Under initially started empiric therapy with intravenous acyclovir and analgesics the patient completely recovered within a few days."
