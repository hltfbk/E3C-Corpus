  "text": "A 25-year-old Asian female had a RTHβ Y321C mutation with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was followed-up through gestation and two years postpartum, revealing development of postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) with characteristic wide fluctuations in serum thyrotropin levels, and of spontaneous recovery from an episode of transient hypothyroidism. The presence of RTHβ did not prolong thyroiditis duration nor progressed toward permanent hypothyroidism. Prenatal genetic analysis was not performed on the unaffected fetus, and did not result in congenital hypothyroidism, possibly because maternal free thyroxine (FT4) levels were mildly elevated at less than 50% above the reference range in early gestation and gradually decreased to less than 20% after the 28th gestational week."
