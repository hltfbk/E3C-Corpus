  "text": "We present the case of a 68-year-old woman with refractory MM who received pomalidomide in combination with various drugs including anthracyclines, alkylators and proteasome inhibitors. Initially, major hematological toxicities and infectious complications including a hepatitis B virus reactivation were encountered. With careful dose adjustments and selection of combination partners, pomalidomide treatment was maintained for over 4 years and led to a sustained partial remission. In particular, the well-tolerated regimen of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone together with pomalidomide was administered for >30 cycles."
