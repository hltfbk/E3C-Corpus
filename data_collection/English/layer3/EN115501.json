  "text": "This case report describes a 33-year-old Asian woman presenting with mild persistent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting who had undergone male-to-female sex reassignment surgery four years prior. Physical examination revealed mild abdominal pain without rebound tenderness. An abdominal computed tomography scan showed a massive abscess that occupied a significant portion of the intra-abdominal cavity. Perforation of the neovagina was confirmed by exploratory laparotomy and surgical drainage with primary closure was performed without any complications."
