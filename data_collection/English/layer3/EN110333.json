  "text": "A 61-year-old male presented in our hospital (Department of Urology-Oncology, \"Theageneio\" Cancer Hospital of Thessaloniki, Greece) with extensive genital warts located in the pubic area, inguinal area, penis and peri-anal region, complaining about defecation difficulty. The patient was aware of the presence of these warts for 15 years but never submitted to any therapy. The patient underwent laboratory tests including biochemical tests and virology assessment for HBC, HCV and HIV. A colonoscopy was planned in order to investigate the bowel obstruction, which was negative for any lesions beyond the anal area and a biopsy was taken to confirm the diagnosis of HPV-related genital warts, pathologically.\nAs a result and due to persistent anal pseudo-obstruction from the extensive anal ring lesions, a surgical transverse colostomy was deemed necessary, by the colorectal surgeon. Subsequently, all anal defects including infected peri-anal skin were removed, while rectal mucosa was preserved and the area was reconstructed using two transposition flaps. Three months later, the patient was submitted to surgical removal of the lesions on the pubic area and penis, by the Urologic Surgeon and with the assistance of a Plastic Surgeon, the large skin deficit was restored using skin flaps. Then, four months later, the patient underwent again a second resection of the peri-anal tissue due to anal stenosis that didn't allow any endoscopic evaluation. The deficit from the circumferential resected scarring tissue was closed anew, using a z-plastic technique for maximum cosmetic results. Three months later the bowel ostomy was restored. Despite their massive size, the lesions were completely healed and the patient didn't have any recurrence at 1 year of follow-up."
