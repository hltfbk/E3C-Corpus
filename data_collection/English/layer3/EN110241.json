  "text": "A 57-year-old woman was referred to our digestive endoscopy unit by otorhinolaryngologist for cervical diverticulum. During the last 3 years she experienced an intermittent dysphagia to solid materials, odynophagia and anxiety. At laryngoscopy a polyp was seen at the piriform sinus and confirmed by cervical computed tomography, pharyngoesophageal magnetic resonance imaging. Nine days earlier she underwent an external transcervical polyp resection. Surgery included cervicoeosophagotomy, polyp resection and esophageal repair. Subsequently, she experienced a localized cutaneous infection at the cervicotomy site without fever or leucoytosis. At barium contrast esophagography a diverticulum extending from the cervical esophagus down to the left side was diagnosed. Flexible esophagoscopy revealed a 20-mm tear at the piriform sinus leading to access into a 7 x 3 cm pharyngoesophageal diverticulum. However the patient was in stable general condition without progressive sepsis. A decision was made to manage the case with conservative approach. Oral intake was stopped, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was placed with aid of a biliary guidewire (0.035-inch-diameter) advanced in the esophagus, to avoid accidental passage in the diverticulum. Administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics was continued. The patient remained stable during hospitalization. Nine weeks later barium contrast esophagography demonstrated a complete regression of the diverticulum and endoscopy revealed complete resolution of the pharyngeal tear. The PEG was extracted and the patient was initiated on oral feeds. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient had no signs of dysphagia or any other complaints."
