  "text": "A 23-year-old male with a four month history of a progressively increasing left anterior thoracic wall mass of 5Â cm in diameter was referred from oncology for clinical re-evaluation and for echocardiography. Systemic examination was essentially normal. Transthoracic and trans-oesophageal echocardiography showed the presence of a pericardial mass around the right atrioventricular junction. Thoracic CT scan showed an anterior mass in left chest wall extending to the pericardium and also the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Mantoux test was positive and histological examination of tissue biopsy confirmed the presence of TB. However, blood tests and culture of aspirated purulent fluid were unyielding. A diagnosis of pericardial tuberculoma with mediastinal and parietal extension was made and patient was successfully treated with standard anti-TB chemotherapy."
