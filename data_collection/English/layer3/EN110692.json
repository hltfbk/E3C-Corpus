  "text": "The patient was 16 months old, with a history of delayed physical development, multiple upper respiratory infections and otitis media episodes. She was referred to our orthopedic clinic because of bowed legs and an abnormal plain chest radiograph. Both upper and lower extremities were bowed. Plain X-rays showed thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis, with anterior and posterior vertebral scalloping, and thin, wavy ribs. Hypoplasia of the pubis and ischium, with bilateral coxa valga, were also noted. Target exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous mutation of FLNA, c.3578 T > C, p.Lys1193Pro, which confirmed the diagnosis of MNS. Her older sister and mother had minimal deformities of the axial and extremity skeleton, but genetic analyses revealed the same FLNA mutation as the patient. The mutation identified in this family has not been previously reported."
