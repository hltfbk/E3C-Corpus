  "text": "A 60-year-old man complaining of 1-month history of episodic chest pain at rest was admitted to our hospital. The diagnosis of coronary spastic angina was made based on the angiographic evidence of vasospasm at the right coronary artery (RCA). The patient responded poorly to conventional medical treatment during the 1-year follow-up. The repeated angiography revealed totally occlusion of the proximal segment of the RCA at the same location as 1 year before, and IVUS demonstrated there was vulnerable plaque and thrombus at the site of spasm. Episodic chest pain ceased completely in the follow up period after stenting."
