  "text": "A 9-year-old girl, 1 year after Salter and Pemberton osteotomy with K-wires, and a 15-year-old boy, 1 year after fracture of the right femur treated by osteosynthesis with TENs, were treated in our department due to HO. The girl did not report any symptoms, while the boy had pain in the location where the ossification had formed. However, examination of the girl's hip showed that the range of motion in the hip affected by HO was limited in comparison with the opposite unaffected hip."
