  "text": "Here we report the first two clinical cases successfully managed by genicular axial pattern flap closure. A 2-year-old 38 kg (83.77-lb) intact male Labrador Retriever and a 14-year-old 42 kg (92.59-lb) spayed mixed breed female dog were admitted for the management of large skin defects in the lateral tibiotarsal joint. One defect was the result of a fibrosarcoma removal in the Labrador dog and the other defect was a chronic large wound caused by a car accident in the mixed breed female dog. Both defects were reconstructed by using genicular flaps. The bed of the wound in mixed breed dog was surgically debrided and underwent open wound management until a proper granulation tissue bed was formed before reconstruction. The skin defect in the Labrador dog was covered immediately after tumor removal. After surgery both dogs were bearing weight on the limbs normally. Small area of dehiscence occurred in both dogs 2 weeks after surgery. At follow-up examination one month after surgery, the surgical wound of the Labrador retriever still had a small area of dehiscence. Two months after surgery, the wound of the mixed breed dog was completely healed, covered with hair and no lameness was observed."
