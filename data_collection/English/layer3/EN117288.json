  "text": "In this report, we describe the case of a 49-year-old Caucasian woman known for years to have fibrous dysplasia in the left femur and tibia who presented with progressive pain in her left leg and soft swelling in the left quadriceps region. After surgical intervention with excision of the soft-tissue mass, the diagnosis of Mazabraud's syndrome was confirmed. During follow-up, our patient presented with a painless mass located on the lateral side of the left knee, next to a second, intra-osseous lesion with the same characteristics in the left lateral tibial plateau. The histopathological examination was consistent with a soft-tissue intra-osseous myxoma."
