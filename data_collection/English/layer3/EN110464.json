  "text": "A 17-year-old virgin girl referred to our tertiary center with a story of primary amenorrhea and severe cyclic abdominal pain occuring over a period of three years. General examination results were normal and secondary sexual characteristics were well developed. The hymen was intact and had normal perforations. Ultrasound was suggestive of hematometra with right endometrioma of 7 x 7cm. Laparoscopy was proposed and showed a low abundance of brownish blood suggesting tubal reflux, the uterus and appendix were normal. A cystectomy was done. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a normal endometrial cavity and the absence of cervical canal; the vagina was normal. Informed consent from the patient's parents was obtained after verbal counseling and an explanation of the potential risks of the surgery. A laparotomy was performed under general anesthesis. Intra-operatively, uterus was enlarged with normal bilat√©ral fallopian tubes, ovaries were normal. The proximal end of vagina was exposed after dissection of the visceral peritneum between uterus and the bladder. Midline incision in the isthmus was done to reach the caudal portion of endometrial cavity. A utero-vaginal anastomosis was successfully performed. The patient's postoperative course was without problems. Menses were observed the first month after the operation. Subsequently, our patient continued to have regular periods while we followed her for the next six months. The pelvic ultrasound examination was normal."
