  "text": "Herein, we present the case of a 34-year-old woman with relapsing-remitting MS, with a history of treatment with glatiramer acetate and natalizumab, who subsequently received Alemtuzumab (12 mg / 24 h × 5 days). 70-days after the last Alemtuzumab administration, the patient displayed neutropenia (500 neutrophils/μL) with virtual absence of B-cells (0.6% of total lymphocytes), low values of CD4-T-cells (6.6%) and predominance of CD8-T-cells (48%) and NK-cells (47%); while large granular lymphocytes (LGL) predominated in the blood-smear examination. Due to prolonged neutropenia (5-days) the patient was placed on low-dose corticosteroids leading to sustained remission."
