  "text": "A 67-year-old Hispanic female presented to our hospital with a three-week history of right arm numbness and poor coordination. Computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast of the brain and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple enhancing nodular densities throughout the brain. CT with intravenous contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a left hilar mass and a medial left upper lobe mass. Histopathological findings were consistent with a neuroendocrine neoplasm of bronchial origin."
