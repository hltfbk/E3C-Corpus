  "text": "A 14-year old girl was referred to Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital (NMAH) from a district level Hospital few hours after intentional ingestion of a large unquantifiable amount of metformin tablets. This was following an argument with her mother who is diabetic and on metformin treatment. The patient herself was not known with diabetes or psychiatric illness and had no significant past medical history. She was not on any chronic medications.\nThe notable findings on physical examination were acidotic breathing, sinus tachycardia of 120 beats per minute, hypotension (BP 80/45 mmHg) and abdominal tenderness. She was drowsy but arousable.\nArterial blood gas on arrival to NMAH showed PH = 7.05, Po2 =115 mmHg= PCo2 = 27.5 mmHg, Base Excess = -23 mmol/L, bicarbonate = 7.6 mmol/, potassium = 6.7 mmol/L, capillary glucose reported low on the glucometer. Lactate level was rejected by the laboratory because of it was not sent on ice. Her other laboratory results at presentation were marked leukocytosis, severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia as well as mild elevation of the liver enzymes as depicted in Table 1. Electrocardiogram showed peaked T-waves and sinus tachycardia. Chest radiograph was unremarkable. Blood cultures and toxicology screen for paracetamol and salicylate levels were negative.\nA diagnosis of metformin associated lactic acidosis was made and 100 grams of activated charcoal was administered in the emergency department. She also received 20mls boluses of 50% dextrose several times and was subsequently maintained on intravenous 5% dextrose infusion. Her renal function started deteriorating on the second day after admission in keeping with AKI; (urea 12.6 mmo/L, Creatinine = 251 umol/L, K=7.2 mmol/L) most likely due to metformin toxicity. Hyperkalemia was initially treated with the combination of intravenous calcium gluconate and insulin-glucose to facilitate intracellular shift of potassium. She also received 100mls of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate via a central line.\nDue to lack of bed in ICU/high care, it was decided that the patient be treated in our acute peritoneal dialysis unit. Peritoneal dialysis was started because of limited availability of haemodialysis. After 45 cycles of peritoneal dialysis in 5 days, she achieved recovery of renal function with restoration of urine output, acid-base balance and complete resolution of lactic acidosis. She was discharged home on the 7 th day after admission in very good condition."
