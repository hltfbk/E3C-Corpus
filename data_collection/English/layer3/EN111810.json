  "text": "A 73-year-old lady, known rheumatoid and osteoporotic with a history of long-term bisphosphonate intake, presented with sudden onset right thigh pain after trivial trauma. We diagnosed a complete atypical femoral fracture, treated with closed intramedullary nailing. 4 months later, she presented with dull aching left thigh pain for 2 weeks. Radiographic features suggested an incomplete atypical femoral fracture, treated with prophylactic insitu intramedullary nailing. At 1 year follow-up, lady was walking well with stick support."
