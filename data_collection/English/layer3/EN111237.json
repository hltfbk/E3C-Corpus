  "text": "A patient with secondary infertility who had undergone three cycles of assisted reproductive technique (ART) is described. With regard to good follicular response, two oocytes were obtained in the first two ART cycles, but no embryo was formed. In the third ART cycle, which is the subject of this study, ovulation was induced by dual trigger of a supernormal dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) combined with a delayed oocyte retrieval approach. The method involved administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, recombinant HCG, and urinary HCG 39 h before ovum pick-up. Ten oocytes were recovered, two out of three mature eggs were fertilized after intracytoplasmic sperm injection, resulting in two embryos that were subsequently cryopreserved. The case report guidelines have been used herein to present the first case of this novel dual trigger method."
