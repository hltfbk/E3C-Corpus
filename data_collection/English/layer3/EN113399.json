  "text": "We report a case of complete splenic infarction and obliteration of the splenic artery and vein after LSPDP. The patient was a 69-year-old woman with a 35-mm cystic tumor of the pancreatic body who underwent LSPDP. Although the operation was completed with preservation of the splenic artery and vein, postoperative splenic infarction was revealed with left back pain and fluid collection around the stump of the pancreas on postoperative day 9. Fortunately, clinical symptoms disappeared within days and additional splenectomy was not needed. Splenic infarction was attributed to scattered micro-embolizations within the spleen after drawing strongly on the tape encircling the splenic vessels."
