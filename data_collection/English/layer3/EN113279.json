  "text": "A case of elderly female with medical co-morbidities who sustained this injury while working in wheat farms. She presented with complaints of pain and swelling in right arm with inability to move right arm. She was diagnosed as a case of ipsilateral fracture of proximal humerus with anterior glenohumeral dislocation. She was successfully treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for fracture shaft humerus with long proximal humerus locking plate, because of proximal extension of long oblique fracture line using standard delto-pectoral approach with anterolateral distal extension of surgical approach after visualising radial nerve. Following fixation of shaft, close reduction was carried out for anterior shoulder dislocation under image intensifier. Patient was put on regular physiotherapy and follow up at 4 weekly interval for a period of 3 months and subsequently bimonthly interval upto 1 year. Patient achieved near normal and pain- free range of motion at 1 year."
