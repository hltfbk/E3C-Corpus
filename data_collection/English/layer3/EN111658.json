  "text": "A 54-year-old male with worsening chronic bilateral mechanical knee pain had failed conservative therapy. Posterior stabilised (PS), cemented TKA and patella resurfacing was performed. Intraoperatively, collagenous structures such as the menisci and cartilage were noted to be black. Histological examination showed deposition of large amorphous brown material suggestive of ochronosis. He recovered well and underwent TKA of the contralateral knee the following year. At 2 years postindex TKA, his outcome scores improved and he was satisfied."
