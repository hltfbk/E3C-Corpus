  "text": "In the present study, we report about a 32-year-old male caucasian patient with weakness in radial deviation of his left hand. An isolated macrodactyly of his left middle finger had been operated twice. Electroneurography showed a carpal-tunnel-syndrome (CTS) on the left side. MRI of the brachial plexus revealed an additional muscle in the costoclavicular space, identified as SPM. To our knowledge, this is the second case report of a neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome due to SPM, and the first case described with isolated macrodactyly and CTS in the same patient."
