  "text": "A 72-year-old male with history of end-stage renal disease, chronic atrial fibrillation and rheumatic heart disease status post mitral and aortic valve replacements presented with complaints of left thigh erythema with skin induration. Despite multiple antibiotic regimens for presumed cellulitis, the skin lesions progressed to necrotic ulcers. A biopsy revealed evidence of calciphylaxis; a lethal condition typically associated with renal disease. The patient was on warfarin for anticoagulation of his mechanical heart valves as well as prophylactically for atrial fibrillation. Warfarin contributes to the development of calciphylaxis and needed to be exchanged to avoid progression of the ulceration. The only other acceptable option for long-term anticoagulation was subcutaneous unfractionated heparin but this approach was not taken. The patient suffered from further sequelae of calciphylaxis and eventually expired."
