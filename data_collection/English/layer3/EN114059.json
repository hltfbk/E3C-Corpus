  "text": "We describe a 76-year-old male with ureteral metastasis of prostate cancer along with a review of the literature. Initially, based on the diagnostic evaluation, urothelial cell carcinoma of the left distal ureter was suspected. Nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision was performed. The final pathologic diagnosis was prostate cancer metastatic to the ureter."
