  "text": "A 23-year-old nulliparous woman was admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) after cardiopulmonary arrest during urgent hysterectomy because of severe postpartum bleeding. The patient concealed her disease from her family and obstetricians during her pregnancy, and her NPD B diagnosis was revealed during her stay in ICU while searching for the cause of the splenectomy and severe bleeding. Unfortunately, she had a detrimental course with hypoxic brain injury leading to brain death."
