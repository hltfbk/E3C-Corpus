  "text": "A 23-year-old woman was admitted with limb numbness, recurrent tetany and palpitation. Laboratory tests showed hypokalemic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia and secondary hyperaldosteronism, as well as hypocalciuria and transient decreased PTH. Next-generation sequencing detected a novel homozygous mutations c.2039delG in the SLC12A3 gene, and her father and children were all heterozygous carriers."
