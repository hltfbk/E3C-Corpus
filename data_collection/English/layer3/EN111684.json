  "text": "We report the case of a patient with idiopathic sensory peripheral neuropathy who presented with a swelling right knee, as well as distorted and painless gait disorder, diagnosed as Charcot neuroarthropathy of the knee. Partial weight bearing with a hinged knee brace was used to correct the abnormal alignment and gait posture, and bisphosphonates were prescribed to decrease pathological bone resorption. Although the alignment and Knee Society Score got a gradual deterioration, the combination of orthosis and pharmacy could alleviate the symptom to a certain extent."
