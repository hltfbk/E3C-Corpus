  "text": "A 40-year-old man with 4-year history of dyslipidemia and T2DM visited after his interruption of therapy for about 1.5 years. His past history was acute pancreatitis. His life style was markedly disturbed, and he had a lot of risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia. Surprisingly, his serum triglyceride level was as high as 16,900 mg/dL. His aggravation and remission of hypertriglyceridemia were closely associated with the alteration of RLP-cholesterol levels in dyslipidemia and glycoalbumin and ketone body levels in T2DM."
