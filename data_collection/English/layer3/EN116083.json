  "text": "We report of two patients with intestinal failure secondary to mesenteric ischemia. Both patients presented with fever and weight loss while receiving long term home parenteral nutrition. Both of them were found to have mutations in the NOD2 gene. Catheter related infections were ruled out. FDG-PET-CT scans initially obtained in search for another infectious focus that would explain the symptoms unexpectedly showed high FDG uptake in mediastinal lymph nodes. Direct or indirect evidence proved or was highly suggestive for tuberculous lymphadenitis. Intravenous tuberculostatic therapy was started and led to a reversal of symptoms and to resolution of the lesions by FDG-PET-CT."
