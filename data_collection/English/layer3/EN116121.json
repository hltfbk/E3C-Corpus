  "text": "A 74-year-old Korean man presented with visual disturbance in his right eye. He had previously been diagnosed with diabetes and hypertension, which were controlled with oral medications. We diagnosed him with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and he was treated by monthly intravitreal injection of bevacizumab for three months. Four days after his third intravitreal bevacizumab injection, he died of an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture and uncontrolled bleeding."
