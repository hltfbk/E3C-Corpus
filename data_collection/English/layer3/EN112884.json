  "text": "A 23-year-old nulligravida was complaining of irregular vaginal bleeding for one-month duration. Speculum examination revealed a foul-smelling bloody purulent discharge, tender cervix, and a brownish growth located at the posterior cervical lip. A punch biopsy of the growth was performed. Histological examination of the tissue revealed multiple bone fragments with necrosis and an inflammatory exudate. Because of the unusual findings, a repeat biopsy was performed. The biopsy yielded the same findings, which confirmed the diagnosis of osseous metaplasia of the cervix."
