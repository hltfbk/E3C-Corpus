Diagnosis of right ovarian cancer was made for which the patient had explotory laporotomy. Histology of the excised lesion showed tuberculous granuloma, on this account the patient was referred to our hospital; a tertiary health facility and center of excellence in infectious diseases and immunology for further evaluation. On clinical examination the patient was wasted, pale, anicteric and had no peripheral lymph node enlargement.

Liver function test and renal function test including urinalysis were all within normal limit. No abnormality was detected on chest radiograph. Macroscopically the cut section looked grayish white; the section showed fragments of tissue displaying a caseating granulomatous inflammation composed of large areas of central caseous necrosis surrounded by epitheliod cells, multinucleated gaint cells, lymphocytes and fibroblasts in keeping with tuberculous granuloma as in Figure 1. Patient tested HIV-1 after counseling. Her CD4 count was 541cells/ul.
