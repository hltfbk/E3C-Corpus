  "text": "A 52-year-old Thai woman had been diagnosed anti-IFNɣ autoantibodies for 4 years. She had a sore throat, odynophagia, and hoarseness for 3 weeks. She also had febrile symptoms and lost 5 kg in weight. Physical examination revealed marked swelling and hyperemia of both sides of the tonsils, the uvula and palatal arches including a swelling of the epiglottis, and arytenoid. The right tonsillar biopsy exhibited a few intracellular oval and elongated yeast-like organisms with some central transverse septum seen, which subsequently grew a few colonies of T. marneffei on fungal cultures. The patient received amphotericin B deoxycholate 45 mg/dayfor 1 weeks, followed by oral itraconazole 400 mg/day for several months. Her symptoms completely resolved without complication."
