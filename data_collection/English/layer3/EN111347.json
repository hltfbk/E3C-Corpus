  "text": "We report a case of a 22-year-old male with complaints of weakness of all four limbs, impaired vision, urinary incontinence, and dyspnea. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was nine. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed longitudinal extensive transversal myelitis. The brain MRI showed a normal impression, whereas the brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) examination showed a description of the mild demyelination process. The serum antibody AQP4 (AQP4-IgG) results were seronegative, the cerebrospinal fluid examination was normal, and the oligoclonal band was negative. The ophthalmoscopic examination found bilateral papillary atrophy but optical coherence tomography (OCT) was still normal. Somatosensory evoked potential and visual evoked potential examinations were abnormal. The patient was diagnosed with NMOSD and was given combination immunosuppressant therapy, corticosteroids, and therapeutic plasma exchange. The patient experienced significant improvement with EDSS decreased to six."
