  "text": "A 36-year-old Greek woman was admitted to the emergency room of our hospital with signs of acute abdomen. On physical examination, our patient had a painful distended abdomen. Digital examination revealed an empty rectum and bowel obstruction was diagnosed. Our patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and rectum stenosis (almost complete obstruction) was observed. The bowel stenosis was resected, and temporary colostomy and appendectomy were performed. The pathology report showed endometriosis of the colon and the appendix, and our patient received medical treatment for endometriosis. Six months after this operation our patient had another surgery for restoration of large bowel continuity. No endometriosis was found. Our patient was doing well at the one-year follow up."
