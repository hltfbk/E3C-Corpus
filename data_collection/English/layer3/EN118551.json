  "text": "We report the case of an 18 years old, greek male patient with Hughes-Stovin syndrome, who initially presented with deep vein thrombosis. There were no findings consistent with Beh√ßet disease and the haemoptysis was treated successfully with methylprednisolone. Pathogenesis, imaging investigation and treatment of this syndrome are also briefly discussed."
