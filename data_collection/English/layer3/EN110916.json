  "text": "Our case involved a 14-year-old male who had been pushing a heavy object during a basketball match. The patient presented at our emergency department with metaphysis of the distal radius protruding through a transverse volar laceration in the wrist. The patient was immediately taken to the operating room and underwent debridement and internal stabilization of the fractures. The wrist was observed for 18 months and no complication occurred."
