  "text": "A 42-year-old woman with severe anaemia presented with a rapidly enlarging right breast mass, measuring approximately 30 cm × 25 cm × 20 cm that was first noticed 1 year previously. A region of skin ulceration and necrosis (20 cm × 15 cm) was observed on the lateral side of the mass. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a pulmonary nodule, which initially suggested a diagnosis of metastasis. CT showed that the boundaries between the pectoralis major and the mass were blurred, which was presumed to be due to tumour invasion. However, two core needle biopsies of the mass showed no evidence of malignancy. Following these results, the tumour was removed by mastectomy of the right breast. Interestingly, postoperative pathology finally proved the diagnosis of a benign PT. After 1 year of follow-up, wedge resection of the small pulmonary nodule was performed, and it was confirmed that the lung nodule was actually adenocarcinoma rather than metastatic breast cancer. The patient recovered very well without any postoperative treatment."
