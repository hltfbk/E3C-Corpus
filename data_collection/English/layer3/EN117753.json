  "text": "A 72-year-old Caucasian woman presented with a painful left parotid enlargement. She was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma involving the left submandibular gland seven years prior to presentation. Her whole body CT scan showed the absence of pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. However, a magnetic resonance imaging showed enlargement of her left parotid gland and an abnormal parenchyma with mixed-type solid and cystic lesions. A biopsy of her left parotid gland and subsequent histological examination confirmed a mantle cell lymphoma (common variant) relapse."
