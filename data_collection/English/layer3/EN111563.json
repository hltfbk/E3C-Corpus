  "text": "A 5-year-old male was transported to our hospital after a car accident. He was complaining of vague pain in the pelvic region after he was exposed to an acceleration-deceleration trauma, seated in a children's car seat. Radiograph of the pelvis revealed a rare image of bilateral symmetric iliac fractures. Iliac bone fracture was suspected, which was also evident on pelvis and hip magnetic resonance imaging. Additional ultrasound of the abdomen was negative. He was hospitalized for observation, and after one day, he could be discharged from the hospital without complications. Policlinic control after three, six, and ten weeks showed favorable clinical and radiographic evolution."
