  "text": "A 32-year-old male, security personnel by occupation, comes with complaints of painful swelling of the right arm for past 1 week. There was no trauma to the limb and no similar swellings elsewhere in the body. On examination, there was an anteromedial tender swelling of mid-third of arm. X-ray was normal with soft tissue shadow on the anterior aspect. Ultrasound showed cystic lesion with central hyperechoic lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging of arm showed 7.7 mm Ã— 4.8 mm lesion in anteromedial aspect of arm with surrounding edema s/o granuloma. The patient underwent excision of the cyst and biopsy was suggestive of cysticercosis and surrounding granuloma."
