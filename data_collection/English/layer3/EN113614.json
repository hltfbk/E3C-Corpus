  "text": "A 17-year-old male patient with normal body habitus presented with 80Â° of congenital thoracolumbar kyphosis. He underwent kyphosis correction with vertebral column resection and posterior instrumentation and posterior spinal fusion under neuro monitoring. Deformity correction was excellent; the patient was alright in immediate post-operative period. 2 weeks after surgery presented with repeated vomiting and abdominal pain. Contrast computed tomography was showing decreased aortomesenteric angle and decreased aortomesenteric distance which confirmed the diagnosis of superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Initial management was conservative, but as symptoms were progressive, duodenojejunostomy was done. The patient was completely recovered from obstructive symptoms."
