  "text": "We present a case in which non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was found coincidentally in the synovium during knee joint replacement surgery in a 69-year old woman with rheumatoid arthritis. Pigmented, vitreous tissue was resected, which turned out to be a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after histological examination. The coincidental intraoperative finding of intra-articular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was reported twice before, presenting as synovial proliferation in elbow and shoulder surgery. In a few other cases non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presented most often in the knee, as a bone lesion or, when soft tissue was involved, as arthritis."
