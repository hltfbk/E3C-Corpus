  "text": "We report a series of five newborns with gastric duplication cysts which were successfully resected by laparoscopy between January 2010 and April 2015. Case 1, a male newborn was admitted because of severe salivation, choking cough and dyspnea for 30 min after birth. Case 2, a male, was suspected of duodenal ileus by antenatal examination. Case 3, a female was admitted because of vomiting for 5 days. Case 4,a female without significant symptoms simply visited us for the abdominal cyst detected by antenatal examination. Case 5, a male was admitted because of vomiting for 4 days. All patients were performed with a surgery after assistant examinations. Case 1 was died of respiratory failure and the other patients recovered uneventfully."
