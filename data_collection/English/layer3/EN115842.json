  "text": "A 23-year-old-woman received pIOL implantation followed secondary intraocular intervention to lower intraocular pressure. The patient presented with severe pain and decreased visual acuity and was managed with intravitreal and intracameral antibiotic injection with topical applications of fortified antibiotics. Culture of aqueous humor was positive for S. mitis/oralis, which was sensitive to the empiric antibiotic regimen. Clinical features started to improve 5 days after treatment and the pIOL was left in place. The uncorrected distant visual acuity and endothelial cell count were 20/32 and 3143 cells/mm2 four weeks after treatment, respectively."
