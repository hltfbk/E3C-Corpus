  "text": "A sixteen year's old female patient has presented to ENT emergency with a painful dysphagia following an accidental ingestion of a metallic pin without haematemesis or chest pain or dyspnea. The patient was apyretic with stable hemodynamic and no evidence of subcutaneous emphysema on physical examination. Cervical X ray confirmed the presence of the metallic pin while endoscopic investigations have shown no foreign body. It found only a bulging of the left wall of the hypopharynx with no bruising or mucosal wound. Cervical CT scan revealed the migration of the foreign body through the esophageal wall and the left transverse foramen of the third cervical vertebrae with left vertebral artery dissection. The metallic pin was successfully found under hypopharyngoscopy and esophagoscopy with the operating fluoroscopy guidance. After mucosal incision performed on the hypopharynx left wall bulging, the pin has been removed with a forceps clamp. A nasogastric tube was set up for a week. Antibiotherapy was maintained for 10 days and antiplatelet therapy for 3 months. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 3 days. Post operative follow up has been uneventful over 10 months."
