  "text": "We report a rare neglected case covering a 32-year period of a locally aggressive synovial osteochondromatosis of the elbow in a 47-year-old man. Clinical examination revealed a significant increase in size of the left elbow compared to the contralateral one. The simple radiographs and the computed tomography showed multiple rounded, calcified bodies widespread throughout the elbow joint. At surgery we removed and counted a total of 312 loose bodies, varying in size from a few millimeters to 3 cm. The evaluation at 6 months postoperatively showed marked reduction in the volume of the elbow, improvement of extension and flexion and an increase of the Mayo elbow performance score from 50 points before surgery to 80 points at 6 months postoperative."
