  "text": "We presented a case of vaginal abscess that caused voiding dysfunction without surgery history. A 64-year-old woman had a past history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. She came to our clinic following urinary difficulty with perineal tenderness. Bladder ultrasonography revealed a pelvic cystic lesion with a mass effect on the bladder. The presence of a vaginal abscess was suspected following pelvic examination and transvaginal ultrasound. After transvaginal drainage of the vaginal abscess and a full course of antibiotic treatment, she recovered well without any urination symptoms."
