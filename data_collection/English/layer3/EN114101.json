  "text": "A 28-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a 2-week history of uveitis in his right eye. Ophthalmoscopic examination of the right eye revealed fine keratoprecipitates and moderate cell infiltration into the anterior chamber and vitreous. No obvious retinal lesion was observed. Despite initiation of topical corticosteroids, CRVO developed a few weeks later in the right eye. TB-associated uveitis was diagnosed based on a positive tuberculin skin test and interferon-Î³ release assay in addition to the ocular findings. Anti-TB therapy together with IVR and systemic corticosteroids was initiated. Although fundus findings associated with CRVO gradually improved, CRVO with VH recurred before the fourth IVR. Although IVR was continued, VH progressed to obscure fundus observation. Therefore, vitrectomy and panretinal photocoagulation were performed. After surgery, ocular inflammation was controlled, and anti-TB therapy was continued for 6 months and was suspended."
