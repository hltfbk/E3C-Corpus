  "text": "We present a baby girl who had a neonatal tooth with sublingual ulceration (Riga-Fede disease), which resulted in a difficulty to breastfeed for the baby and nipple pain to the mother. Following the extraction of the baby's tooth, she immediately continued breastfeeding, and her tongue ulcer healed well."
