  "text": "A 38 year old Sri Lankan, who has received his 2nd ABO matched live donor transplantation, which was complicated with perinephric hematoma and massive transfusion syndrome. He presented with fever, worsening headache and papilledema. An urgent magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed an occipital abscess with midline shift. Craniotomy and drainage followed by 3 week course of imipenem and levofloxacin, which rendered him symptom free. After 12 months he has stayed recurrence free. Imaging and bacteriology of the respiratory tract failed to demonstrate Nocardia infection."
