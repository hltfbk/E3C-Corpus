  "text": "This case report describes a young female patient who suffered from BD with recurrent abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysms, as well as deep venous thrombosis and subsequent complications of incomplete intestinal obstruction. This patient first underwent stent grafting, which was followed by rupture of two newly formed anastomotic pseudoaneurysms within six months. Emergency open surgical repair (OSR) was then performed on the ruptured pseudoaneurysms. Thrombosis and incomplete ileus occurred five months after surgery. This case was unique due to the presence of incomplete intestinal obstruction being the possible main complaint for a patient with Behcet's disease, and it is the first ever case to be reported."
