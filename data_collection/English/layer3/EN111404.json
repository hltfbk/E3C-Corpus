  "text": "A 38-year-old highly myopic Chinese female complained of blurred vision in her right eye. Her best corrected visual acuitiy was 20/20 OU, and her refraction was -â€‰9.00S OU. Dilated fundus examination revealed mild vitreous hemorrhage and abnormal vascular network nasal to the optic disc in her right eye. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)- angiography (OCTA) B-Scan showed superficial retinoschisis and well-depicted abnormal retinal microvascular network in inner retinal layer. Sectoral scatter laser photocoagulation was administered. Regression of most abnormal vessels was achieved in 1 month, but the patient experienced an unexpected episode of vitreous hemorrhage 3 months after the initial treatment, which was absorbed spontaneously in 2 weeks. Supplemental laser photocoagulation was applied and regular follow-up visit was suggested."
