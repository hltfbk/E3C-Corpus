  "text": "We describe a case of neonatal male with genital anomalies, growth delay, skin hyperpigmentation, chronic lung disease with recurrent infection, anemia, and severe deafness. Without any clear etiology after routine workflow, whole exome sequencing was carried on. A pathogenic de novo SAMD9 mutation and compound heterozygous likely-pathogenic variants in SLC19A2 were identified. Some symptoms were improved after the patient was treated with vitamin B1. Unfortunately, the boy died from sepsis and multiple organ failure before 1 year old."
