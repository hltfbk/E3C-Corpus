  "text": "A 78-years old male was admitted at our hospital with clinical and laboratory features allowing to make the diagnosis of AML. No evidence of a preceding CML (splenomegaly or basophilia) was found. The karyotype on G-banded metaphases was 46,XY, t(9;22)(q34;q11). While the molecular analysis was ongoing, the patient started treatment based on hydroxyurea followed by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. The molecular biology analysis revealed the simultaneous presence of the common p190 e1a2 and the rare e6a2 isoforms. Because of persistent pancytopenia and presence of blasts, according to the molecular data, he was then switched to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment. Nevertheless, after 2â€‰months, the patient was still refractory to second line treatment dying because of a pulmonary infection."
