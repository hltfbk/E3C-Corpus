  "text": "A 52-year-old male patient presented with persistent limping gait. When we requested him to do dorsiflexion and plantar flexion of his ankle in the standing and seating positions, we didn't see any abnormality. However, we could see the DG during the gait. There were no evidences of common peroneal neuropathy and L5 radiculopathy in the electrodiagnostic study. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine, lower leg, and brain had no definite finding. No specific finding was seen in the neurologic examination. For further evaluation, a wireless surface electromyography (EMG) was performed. During the gait, EMG amplitude of left medial and lateral gastrocnemius (GCM) muscles was larger than right medial and lateral GCM muscles. When we analyzed EMG signals for each muscle, there were EMG bursts of double-contraction in the left medial and lateral GCM muscles, while EMG analysis of right medial and lateral GCM muscles noted regular bursts of single contraction. We could find a cause of DG in FMDs."
