  "text": "A 57-year old Caucasian man underwent penetrating keratoplasty in his left eye, due to corneal bullosa after cataract extraction surgery. Twelve months after the penetrating keratoplasty, he visited our emergency service complaining of burning and foreign body sensation in his operated eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed a central, round-shaped ulcer of the graft. Due to poor response to the intensive topical antibiotic therapy, corneal collagen cross-linking was applied 3 days after admission, in an attempt to control the infection. Cultures indicated the predominance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection. Five days after corneal collagen cross-linking treatment, the epithelium was completely re-epithelized, while the transparency of the transplanted cornea was gradually restored within the 12-month follow-up period. No relapses occurred."
