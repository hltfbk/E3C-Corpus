  "text": "We report a case of a 52-year-old MSM eligible for PrEP as he was exposed to a high risk of HIV infection, presented no clinical symptoms of HIV primary infection and was seronegative for HIV. PrEP therapy was then initiated with fixed association of emtricitabine-tenofovir disoproxil. One month later, HIV tests using two different assays were positive, despite perfect compliance reported by the patient and confirmed by plasma drug level. A retrospective search for plasma viral RNA in the blood sample before PrEP initiation turned out positive. Genotyping and treatment sensitivity performed on sample after one month of PrEP showed a virus resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine. Similar cases in the literature and pivotal studies have reported HIV infections in patients initiating or undergoing PrEP. These patients where either infected but still seronegative, displaying no clinical symptoms upon enrollment, or became infected during PrEP. Reasons are mainly poor compliance to treatment, resistance to PrEP, and lack of diagnosis before PrEP. Guidelines advocate safe sex behavior before initiation, search for clinical signs of HIV primary infection and two different serologic tests performed with one-month interval."
