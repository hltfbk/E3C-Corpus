  "text": "We report a case of ocular metastasis in a 46-year-old Brahmin woman presenting with right eye pain. She had been treated for stage IIIc left-sided breast cancer 2 years ago with six cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide after undergoing modified radical mastectomy. An ophthalmic examination revealed a tender subconjunctival swelling superotemporally on retracting right upper eyelid. This finding alone indicated anterior scleritis. On examining fundus under mydriasis, an amelanotic subretinal mass could be visualized in the posterior pole superotemporal to macula. An orbital magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass of 2 × 1 cm in size in the subretinal space of her right eye. Computed tomography of her chest was then done and showed multiple metastases in both lungs."
