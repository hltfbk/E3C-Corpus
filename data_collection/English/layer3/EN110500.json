  "text": "A 70-year-old man with dyspnea on exertion. He is followed for arterial hypertension. The patient had no history of any cardiac disorders or any family history of cardiac masses. On physical examination, her heart rate was 50bpm and her blood pressure was 140/70mmHg. Chest radiograph revealed a cardiothoracic ratio of 55% with no evidence of pulmonary edema or metastasis. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 50bpm. Laboratory tests were normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a round, pedunculated, mobile mass (size, 20mm X 13mm) in the LV outflow tract that seemed to arise from the LV side of the interventricular septum, but was without calcification, hyperlucency, or vasculature. The other cardiac valves and cavities were free of lesions. The remaining echocardiographic findings were normal with an LV ejection fraction of 60%. Angiographic study revealed normal coronary arteries. The LV mass was surgically excised under cardiopulmonary bypass via a median sternotomy. The ascending aorta and both venae cavae were cannulated and standard cardiopulmonary bypass was performed. The heart was stopped by cross-clamping the ascending aorta. Myocardial protection was achieved by means of tropical cooing with ice and intermittent anterograde administration of cold-blood cardioplegic solution. After aortotomy, a jelly-like mass became visible in the LV outflow tract through the aortic cusps. The LV mass was completely removed with adjacent tissue of the interventricular septum. The results of the histopathologic examination of the excised specimen were consistent with the diagnosis of a myxoma. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful and she was discharged without any complications."
