  "text": "This case reports the first dual therapy of temporary left ventricular extracorporeal device CentriMag with distal banding technique and human amniotic stem cell injection for treating a severe refractory cardiogenic shock of an 68-year-old female patient. A minimally-invasive off-pump LVAD was established by draining from the left ventricle and returning to the right axillary artery with distal arterial banding to prevent right upper extremity hyperperfusion. Amniotic stem cells were injected intramyocardially at the left ventricular apex, lateral wall, inferior wall, and right subclavian vein."
