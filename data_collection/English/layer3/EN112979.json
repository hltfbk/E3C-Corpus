  "text": "Here we report a novel DNMT1 mutation in a sporadic case of a Chinese patient with cerebellar ataxia, multiple motor and sensory neuropathy, hearing loss and psychiatric manifestations. Furthermore, we elucidated its pathogenic effect through molecular genetics studies and revealed that this defective DNMT1 function is responsible for the phenotypes in this individual."
