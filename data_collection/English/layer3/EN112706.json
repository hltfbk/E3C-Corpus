  "text": "We present the case of a 51-year-old man with lymphoproliferative syndrome. Our patient underwent morphological and immunohistochemical investigations of biopsy materials from the right inguinal lymph node. The morphological picture was characteristic for small cell lymphoma. Immunophenotypically, tumor proliferate cells expressed CD20, CD76b, CD5, and cyclin D, and the tumor immunophenotype matched mantle cell lymphoma."
