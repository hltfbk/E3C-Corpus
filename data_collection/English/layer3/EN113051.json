  "text": "We report the case of a 75-year-old Cameroonian man of the Bamileke ancestry who developed multiple fixed drug eruptions a few hours following ivermectin intake that worsened with repeated drug consumption. Discontinuation of the drug, counselling, systemic steroids, and orally administered antihistamines were the treatment modalities employed. Marked regression of the lesions ensued with residual hyperpigmentation and dyschromia."
