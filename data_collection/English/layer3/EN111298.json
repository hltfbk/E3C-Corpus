  "text": "In this study, we reported on two male siblings, aged 4 and 2 years, with motor and mental developmental delays and mild dysmorphic facial features. To identify the genetic causes of these symptoms, we employed trio-whole exome sequencing for the proband. We found a novel hemizygous missense variant in the PAK3 gene (c.1112G > A, p.Cys371Tyr), which encodes the p21-activated kinase 3, in the proband, which inherited from mother. The younger brother also has the hemizygous variant, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The variant is located in the kinase domain and was regarded as a likely pathogenic variant in this family."
