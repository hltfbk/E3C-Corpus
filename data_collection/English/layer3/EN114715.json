  "text": "We present a case of delayed diagnosis of Cystoisospora belli (C. belli) in an immunocompetent 28-year-old refugee from Myanmar. She had a history of chronic diarrhea where exhaustive investigations over many years failed to reveal a diagnosis. Cystoisospora belli cysts were finally detected in stool 4 years after investigation commenced, and PCR testing on stored colon biopsies amplified a molecular product with 99 % sequence homology to C. belli. The patient improved promptly with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment."
