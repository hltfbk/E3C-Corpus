  "text": "We describe two cases of pediatric EVN with clinical onset characterized by behavioral and attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorders. The association between behavioral/attention disorders in childhood and the presence of a frontal neurocytoma has never been described before. Furthermore, inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity are common among the neurobehavioral and developmental disorders in childhood. We reviewed 43 pediatric cases of extraventricular neurocytoma included in the PubMed database and their clinical presentation, and we never found this unusual relationship."
