  "text": "A - 62-year-old female patient, who had past medical history of well treated pulmonary tuberculosis 6 years ago, that hospitalized because of a chronic abdominal pain for 10months.The patient reported weight loss about 6-kg during her illness. The physical examination found palpable per-umbilical mass (10 cm of diameter), hard and mobile relatively to the deeper and superficial neighboring structures. No lymph node or ascites was found. Laboratory exams: complete blood count was in normal range and tumor markers were negative. Computer tomography scanning of the abdomen showed a round tissular mass with irregular edges, which makes 14 cm in its great axis, with central necrotic areas enhancement in the peripheral zones. A primitive pelvic tumor was suspected. At laparotomy exploration, the surgeons noted a pink multiloblar tumor of the transverse mesocolon of 15 cm is his greatest axis, without any ascites or peritoneal carcinoid. The surgeons performed a resection of the tumor and the adjacent part of the mesocolon. On macroscopically exam, the tumor was 15cm of diameter, firm with necrotic areas. Histopathological examination combined with immunohistochemical studies established the diagnosis of pleomorphous sarcoma of the mesocolon. The postoperative course was uneventful. No adjuvant therapy was instituted."
