  "text": "A 57-year-old woman with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complaining of blurred vision in both eyes was diagnosed with bilateral HCQ retinopathy and CMO based on characteristic photoreceptor defects and cystoid spaces on optical coherence tomography, hypo-autofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence, and corresponding visual field defects. After treatment with systemic acetazolamide and topical dorzolamide, CMO showed partial resolution in the right eye. Owing to worsening renal function, an intravitreal dexamethasone implant was placed in the right eye, which resulted in resolution of CMO and visual improvement from 20/50 to 20/30."
