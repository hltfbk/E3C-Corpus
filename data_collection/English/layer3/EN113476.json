  "text": "We report the case of a 74-year-old male patient diagnosed with stage IIIA programmed death-ligand 1-positive non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma treated with 4 cycles of carboplatin/pemetrexed plus pembrolizumab combination therapy followed by 2 cycles of pembrolizumab treatment. Follow-up PET-CT scanning showed a very good response at the level of the tumor but new-onset activity in bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. Biopsy of these lymph nodes revealed a benign pathology with noncaseating granulomas consistent with immune-mediated sarcoidosis."
