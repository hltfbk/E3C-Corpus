  "text": "The patient, age 11, presented with flu-like symptoms and persistent severe diarrhea. Enterovirus has been detected over several months, however, exact typing of a positive cell culture remained inconclusive. Unbiased metagenomic sequencing then detected MRV in stool samples from several time points. The sequencing approach further revealed co-infection with a recombinant Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus. MRV-specific antibodies detected by immunofluorescence proved that the patient seroconverted."
