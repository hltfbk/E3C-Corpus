  "text": "Herein, we describe a case of a 57-year-old woman suffering from advanced pancreatic leiomyosarcoma with thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein, as well as liver lesions which were suspicious for metastasis. Multidisciplinary team decided for upfront chemotherapy to assess tumor response. Follow-up imaging after the completion of chemotherapy led tumor board to decide for subsequent surgical exploration. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and irreversible electroporation ablation of the pancreatic tumor. Postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged 10â€‰days later with a plan to receive adjuvant therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of pancreatic leiomyosarcoma ever reported, treated with this novel technique of irreversible electroporation that could be an alternative and feasible way for the management of these rare malignancies."
