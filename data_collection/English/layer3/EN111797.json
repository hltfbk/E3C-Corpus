  "text": "A 78-year-old female patient weighing 38 kg with gangrene and occlusive peripheral atherosclerosis of the right leg underwent an emergency middle thigh amputation. The patient had a history of hypertension, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, anterior wall myocardial infarction, and had recently undergone percutaneous coronary intervention consisting of coronary angiography and right coronary artery stent implantation. Considering the patient's condition, an ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca compartment block combined with general anesthesia was implemented for amputation. The fascia iliaca compartment block provided analgesia for the operation, and reduced the dosage of general anesthetics. It also alleviated adverse cardiovascular effects caused by pain stress, and ensured the safety of the patient during the perioperative period. This block also provided postoperative analgesia. The patient had a good prognosis, and was subsequently discharged from hospital."
