  "text": "A 32-year old gentleman presented with an irreducible patella dislocation following an unusual atraumatic mechanism. Following attempts at closed reduction under sedation and regional nerve block, eventual open reduction and soft tissue reconstruction was required under general anesthetic. During the open reduction procedure, it was noted that the patella had dislocated into a lateral extra-articular position and rotated around its vertical axis. Following patella reduction, the medial patellar retinaculum was repaired. Examination under anesthetic revealed satisfactory tracking of patella following repair."
