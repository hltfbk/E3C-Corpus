  "text": "A 46-year-old male with irreducible lateral subtalar dislocation caused sustentaculum tali incarceration confirmed on computed tomography (CT). The patient underwent emergent open reduction and internal fixation; the sustentaculum tali was reduced and fixed with a compression screw. At 3 years, \"American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-hindfoot\" score was 86, and the functional result was considered excellent despite a Grade I subtalar osteoarthritis on the ankle X-ray."
