  "text": "The patient was a 72-year-old man who was admitted with a chief complaint of abdominal pain for more than 1 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed that there was a mass in the descending colon, which led to intestinal obstruction. On admission, a series of therapeutic measures, such as fasting and water deprivation, gastrointestinal decompression, total parenteral nutrition, and octreotide acetate, were taken to improve the obstructive symptoms. At the same time, a self-expandable metal stent was successfully placed across the stenosis, and a biopsy was obtained and diagnosed as adenocarcinoma. CT scanning 14 d after insertion of the stent revealed that the intestine was swollen significantly. Systemic chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) was administered. After two courses of mFOLFOX6, CT scanning showed clearly that swelling of the intestine was improved. Subsequently, the patient underwent left hemi-colectomy without stoma placement. The postoperative course was uneventful, and he has been disease-free for 6 mo after surgery."
