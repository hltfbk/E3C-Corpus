  "text": "A 36-year-old woman with synchronous peritoneal and liver metastases of colorectal origin was treated with a stepwise approach consisting of initial cytoreductive surgery, minor liver resection, intraperitoneal intraoperative hyperthermic chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, right portal embolization, and finally, right hepatectomy achieving an R0 resection. The patient is alive and free of disease after 30 months of follow-up."
