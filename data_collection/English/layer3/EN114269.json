  "text": "We present a case report of 60-year-old Chinese female suffering from chronic sepsis of the hip joint causing acetabular prosthetic protrusion with a concomitant peri-prosthetic femoral shaft fracture secondary to a fall, 5 years post index surgery of bipolar hemiarthroplasty for an intra-capsular neck of femur fracture. This patient subsequently underwent a two-stage revision total hip arthroplasty. We aim to discuss the diagnostic approach and surgical management of this complex case of infected protruded bipolar hip hemi-arthroplasty."
