  "text": "A 50-year-old Caucasian woman presented with generalized bone pain and muscular weakness. Biochemical findings suggested PHPT. She underwent excision of an enlarged right inferior parathyroid gland. Histopathological analysis revealed features of a parathyroid adenoma with foci of epithelioid non-caseating granulomas. The etiology of the granulomatous infiltration could not be determined. She is still normocalcemic at the ninth month after surgery and is being followed for the possible manifestation of an occult disease."
