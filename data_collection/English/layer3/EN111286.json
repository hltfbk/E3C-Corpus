  "text": "We present a patient of 66-year-old female with acute onset of dizziness after chiropractic manipulation of the neck. Neck computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed 'double lumen' sign and 'intimal flap' of the V1 segment of the vertebral artery, which led to the initial diagnosis of vertebral artery dissection (VAD). However, vertebral artery fenestration at V1 segment was eventually identified by multi-directional digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Interestingly, concomitant vertebral fenestration at V3 segment, basilar fenestration and basilar artery tip aneurysm was also revealed by DSA."
