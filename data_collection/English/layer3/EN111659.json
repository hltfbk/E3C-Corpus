  "text": "A 49-year-old female with a previous history of choledocholithiasis and ERCP presented to the emergency department following episodes of sudden cramping, epigastric pain, and nausea. An abdominal CT revealed evidence of SBO with clear evidence of GSI and a cholecystoduodenal fistula. Laparoscopic exploration of the small bowel revealed a large, calcified 3.5 cm × 3 cm gallstone with evidence of pressure necrosis; segmental bowel resection with stapled anastomosis was performed and patient recovered appropriately after surgery. Cholecystectomy was not performed due to multiple co-morbidities and absence of gallbladder stones. However, she presented two months later with signs and symptoms of SBO. A repeat abdominal CT showed dilated bowel with no clear transition point. This was suspected to be due to adhesions. After an initial conservative treatment which produced mild improvement, laparotomy was performed which revealed a second large non-calcified gallstone and necrotic small bowel with a pocket of abscess."
