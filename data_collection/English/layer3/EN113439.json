  "text": "A 71-year-old female with general fatigue, central obesity and impaired glucose tolerance was diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome due to elevated ACTH (192.9 pg/mL; normal range, 7.2-63.3 pg/mL), cortisol (73.1 μg/dL; 6.4-21.0 μg/dL) and 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC) (6160 μg/day; 11.2-80.3 μg/day) levels. Chest computed tomography identified a solid 26.6 × 22.9 × 30.0 mm tumour with a cavity in the upper lobe of the left lung. There was no adrenal gland enlargement. Tumour markers were not significantly elevated; ACTH levels were not suppressed by 8-mg dexamethasone. A corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation test revealed blunted ACTH response (basal ACTH, 204.6 pg/mL; highest ACTH level during the 120-min stimulation test, 214.0 pg/mL). She was diagnosed with EAS due to a lung lesion. MTP treatment was started to reduce cortisol production. ACTH levels and cortisol and UFC levels were normalised and the ACTH-producing lung tumour was ablated after MTP treatment. In several reported cases, plasma ACTH levels reduced during steroidogenesis inhibitor treatment for EAS. Among the 10 patients, three cases of pheochromocytoma, one of thymic carcinoid and one of islet cell carcinoma were reported. In four cases, the tumour was not detected. In our case, the pathology of the lung tumour was unknown because of lack of tumour cells in biopsy. The patients were treated with ketoconazole (KTZ) and/or MTP and exhibited ACTH and cortisol/UFC suppression, but tumour regression was observed only in our case."
