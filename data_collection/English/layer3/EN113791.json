  "text": "A 44-year-old otherwise healthy man presented with visually debilitating floaters in his right eye; these had been present for more than 2 years. Preoperative examination was unremarkable in both eyes, apart from some degree of vitreous degeneration in the right eye. Preoperative visual acuity was 20/20 bilaterally. A 25-gauge transconjunctival sutureless pars plana complete vitrectomy with induction of posterior vitreous detachment was performed in the right eye. Upon examination 1 month after surgery, a small full-thickness macular hole was detected in the right eye. Visual acuity was diminished to 20/80. The macular hole was closed after a second vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling and gas tamponade."
