  "text": "A four-year old male child, product of non-consanguineous marriage, with history of effort dyspnea and recurrent respiratory infection. On physical examination, a systolic murmur was heard in the left parasternal area. Echocardiography provided a diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects.\nIn the operating room, the primumatrial septal defect (ASD) and the mitral cleft were seen. A congenital DOMV was fortuitously discovered. The primum ASD was closed by a patch and the mitral cleft was partially closed in the summit. The DOMV was respected because of the absence of hemodynamic disturbance."
