  "text": "A 77-year-old Japanese woman underwent oblique lumbar interbody fusion surgery for lumbar spondylolisthesis with refractory low back pain and pain in both legs. The patient experienced abdominal pain 2Â days after surgery. Delayed contrast-enhanced computed tomography and retrograde urography revealed leakage of contrasted urine from the ureter into the retroperitoneal space, indicating a ureteral injury. Immediate percutaneous nephrostomy was performed to recover her condition, followed by additional ureteral stenting. She is now free from preoperative symptoms but requires periodic changing of the ureteral stent, with no urinary symptoms."
