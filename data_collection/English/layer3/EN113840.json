  "text": "A 69-year-old man presented to the hospital in a persistent comatose state following a generalized tonic-clonic seizure with high blood pressure. The electrocardiogram revealed transient left bundle branch block. Troponin and BNP were elevated. Cardiac ultrasound showed large apical akinesia with altered left ventricular ejection fraction, and the left ventriculogram showed characteristic regional wall motion abnormalities involving the mid and apical segments. Brain MRI showed bilateral, cortical, and subcortical vasogenic edema predominant in the posterior right hemisphere. The lumbar puncture and cerebral angiography were normal. Paraclinical abnormalities were reversible within 2 weeks with a clinical recovery in 3 months, confirming the takotsubo and the PRES diagnoses."
