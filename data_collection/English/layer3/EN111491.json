  "text": "A 39 years-old woman presented with intermittent vertical diplopia and dizziness within 1-2 months. Ophthalmologic examination revealed downbeat nystagmus and 6 prism diopters of right hypertropia. Funduscopic examination showed mild incyclotorsion on right eye. However, ductions and versions were within normal range. Other neurological examinations were also normal. She had a history of bipolar disorder treated with daily 600-900 mg of lithium for past 6 years, and 2 months before the first visit, daily dose of lithium was increased to 1200 mg. We referred the patients to psychiatrist. Although the serum level of lithium was within the normal therapeutic range, her daily dose of lithium was reduced to 600 mg and then stopped. 6 days after cessation of lithium, down beat nystagmus and right hypertropia were completely resolved and symptoms did not recur over a year."
