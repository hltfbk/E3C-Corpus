  "text": "We present a case of a 72 year old postoperative patient presented with persistent fever. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms demonstrated a lesion in the superior vena cava, protruding into the right atrium and infiltrating the atrial septum. Candida albicans grew in blood cultures as well as in the subclavian catheter tip culture. Anti-fungal and antithrombotic therapy was initiated. After 2 weeks treatment the lesion was diminished."
