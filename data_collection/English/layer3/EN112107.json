  "text": "A six-year-old male patient presented with a history of two bilateral protruding masses in the inguinal-scrotal region that have continued to grow since birth. No gastrointestinal symptoms were reported. Physical examination showed a bilateral inguinoscrotal mass which increased in size during the Valsalva maneuver. Surgical intervention was carried out with a bilateral hernia repair being performed under an anterior method, the surgical invagination of the MD within the small intestine and the appendix within the caecum."
