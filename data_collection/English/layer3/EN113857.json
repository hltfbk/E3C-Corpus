  "text": "59-year-old male patient with history of increasing frontoorbital, bilateral, fluctuating headache and exophthalmos. There was no other associated clinical abnormality. Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) scans confirmed an expansive mass of sphenoid sinus, suggesting mucocele. The patient was submitted to endonasal endoscopic surgery with posterior ethmoidotomy, large sphenoidotomy, and marsupialization of the lesion."
