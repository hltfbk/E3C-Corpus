  "text": "A 73-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of arterial hypertension, thyroid dysfunction, glaucoma, right-sided ptosis and later generalized weakness, was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. Additionally, primary sclerosing cholangitis was detected, initially prohibiting the administration of immunosuppressants. Despite treatment with steroids and pyridostigmine she repeatedly experienced myasthenic crises. After the fifth crisis and after antibody titers had reached levels > 100 nmol/L during two years of follow-up, it was decided to restart azathioprine. Interestingly, low-dose azathioprine (1.5 mg/kg/day) was well tolerated, had a positive clinical and immunological effect and did not worsen primary sclerosing cholangitis."
