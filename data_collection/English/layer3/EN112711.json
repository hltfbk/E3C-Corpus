  "text": "We present a case report of a 53-year-old white man who presented with atraumatic, posterior knee pain and was found to have a congenital, anomalous band originating from the fabella, causing semimembranosus impingement. This was diagnosed with magnetic resonance imaging; he underwent division of the anomalous band, which resulted in complete resolution of his symptoms."
