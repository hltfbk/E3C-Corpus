  "text": "We report a 44-year-old man diagnosed with stage IIIB melanoma who developed metastatic disease (pulmonary and brain metastases) and was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery and nivolumab immunotherapy. He developed asymptomatic multifocal diffuse white matter lesions consistent with active central nervous system demyelination seen on brain MRI. One month after cessation of the immunotherapy, spontaneous regression of the demyelinating lesions was observed, suggesting a nivolumab-related toxicity."
