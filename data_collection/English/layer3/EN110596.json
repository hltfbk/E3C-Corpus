  "text": "A 39-year-old lady presented to our hospital, a tertiary care center with asymmetric swelling of her arms, for over 20 years. Radiographs revealed gross enlargement with marrow expansion of the right humerus, scapula with ground-glass matrix, along with a multiseptated cystic appearance. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography screening for the activity of these lesions incidentally demonstrated a few lung nodules, which on biopsy was found to be atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. The lady also had endocrine dysfunction in the form of diabetes mellitus, for which she was on treatment."
