  "text": "A 60-year-old Japanese woman presented with numbness of both lower extremities. Her platelet count was 1787 x 103/mul. Through bone marrow examination, we diagnosed her condition as myelodysplastic and/or myeloproliferative disorder-unclassifiable. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan revealed aortic thrombosis. Her platelet count was controlled with hydroxyurea and ranimustine. Aspirin and ticlopidine improved the numbness in both lower limbs on the second day. Aortic thrombosis was not observed in a computed tomographic scan on the seventh day."
