  "text": "A healthy 26-year-old Caucasian male fell whilst jogging, suffering a low velocity injury to his right hand. Initial accident and emergency examination and x-rays failed to demonstrate a fracture. At clinic, anteroposterior and carpal tunnel radiographs showed no fracture, however a mistakenly taken oblique x-ray revealed a displaced hamate body fracture."
