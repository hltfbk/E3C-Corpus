  "text": "We describe an 11 year old male Polish patient with a de novo nonsense mutation in CTNNB1 who in addition to the major features of CTNNB1-related syndrome including intellectual disability and microcephaly, exhibited hyperekplexia and apraxia of upward gaze. The patient became symptomatic at the age of 20 months exhibiting delayed speech and psychomotor development. Social and emotional development was normal but mild hyperactivity was noted. Episodic falls when startled by noise or touch were observed from the age of 8.5 years, progressively increasing but never with loss of consciousness. Targeted gene panel next generation sequencing (NGS) and patient-parents trio analysis revealed a heterozygous de novo nonsense mutation in exon 3 of CTNNB1 identifying a novel association of β-catenin with hyperekplexia."
