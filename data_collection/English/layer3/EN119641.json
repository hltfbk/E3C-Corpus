  "text": "The patient was a 42-year-old man with sigmoid colon cancer with direct invasion of the urinary bladder and multiple costal metastases. A diagnosis of T4, M1, stage IV sigmoid colon cancer was made, and curative resection was considered impossible. S-1 at 50 mg/m2 was administered by oral route from day 1 to day 14. Irinotecan (CPT-11) at 40 mg/m2 was administered by intravenous day 1 and 15. This treatment was followed by 2 weeks absent period, and repeated every 4 weeks. Six cycles of administration were performed in total. Following this treatment, the multiple costal metastases resolved. Down-staging to T3, M0, stage IIA was achieved, and curative resection was judged to be possible."
