  "text": "We report a rare case of brain abscess caused by Nocardia brasiliensis in a non-immunocompromised patient. He admitted to our hospital twice with a headache. Stereotaxic aspiration was performed at the patient's first appointment at the hospital, and a craniotomy was used to excise the lesion during subsequent abscess recurrence."
