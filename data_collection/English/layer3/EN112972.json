  "text": "Three Sri Lankan patients, all with a background of diabetes, presented to us with acute nausea and anorexia following recent consumption of star fruit. Two patients complained of diarrhoea and one patient complained of intractable hiccoughs. They all had elevated serum creatinine on admission. Two were known to have normal baseline serum creatinine levels. On renal biopsy two had evidence of oxalate crystal deposition. One did not show crystal deposition but had acute interstitial nephritis for which no alternate cause could be identified. Two were treated with short courses of prednisolone and two required acute haemodialysis. All recovered renal function, with both patients with known baselines approaching their premorbid serum creatinine levels."
