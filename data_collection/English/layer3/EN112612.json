  "text": "A 19-year-old man presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, and based on examination and laboratory findings, he was diagnosed with appendicitis initially. Meanwhile, a CT scan was requested and a foreign object inside the Meckel's diverticulum was noted, and on further questioning, he mentioned that he had chicken with bones 2â€‰days ago. He was taken to the operating theatre, and during laparotomy, the perforated Meckel's diverticulum was found, and it was resected with primary anastomosis."
