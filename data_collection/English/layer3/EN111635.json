  "text": "A 75-year-old female was consulted to evaluate cardiac source of embolism for acute cerebral infarction. The patient underwent left upper lobectomy because of lung cancer 2 years ago. Cardiovascular imaging revealed about 1.6 cm × 1.4 cm sized thrombus within the remnant stump of the left superior pulmonary vein. The patient was treated by anticoagulation with warfarin, because the patients refused surgical removal of thrombus. A 57-year-old female who had a history of right pneumonectomy 10 years ago presented with dyspnea. Cardiovascular imaging revealed 1.7 × 1.5 cm sized thrombus in the right pulmonary artery stump and small pulmonary embolism in the left lower segmental pulmonary artery. The patient was treated by long-term anticoagulation with warfarin, and the thrombus and pulmonary embolism were resolved."
