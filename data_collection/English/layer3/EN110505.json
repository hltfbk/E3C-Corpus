  "text": "It is with this background that we present the case of a five year old girl who presented to our hospital with history of abnormal nail colour and growth since birth. She was noticed at birth to have dark-brownish to black nail colouration. The nail was then noticed to have become thickened and rough at eight months of age and has worsened progressively involving all the twenty nails. The nails falls-off at about 3-4 months interval, this is more on the finger nails when compared with the toe nails. There is no pain except during the period of nail sloughing. There is associated slight thickness of the skin on the lateral planter surfaces as well as nodules involving the elbows. There are no skin rash, no other skin disorder, no alopecia or tooth involvement. There is no history of trauma and no seasonal variation.\nThere is a similar disorder in the father involving one of his toe nails only. No similar history among her siblings.\nParents have presented her to various health centre, medications (both orthodox and traditional) applied without improvement necessitating presentation to us.\nShe's a product of term gestation and fully immunized according to the National Programme on Immunization (NPI). She's the fifth and the last of five children in a monogamous family. The father is a junior civil servant while the mother is a petty trader.\nOn examination there is hyper-pigmented thickened rough nails with sand-paper like appearance in all nails. There are 2-3 solitary non tender nodules in both elbows measuring about 1-2 cm each. There is hyperkeratosis of the medial sides of the planter surfaces of the feet. Other systemic examinations are not remarkable. Assessment; Twenty-Nail-Dystrophy. The parent could not afford histology for the above stated reasons.\nTrial of anti-fungal (topical and systemic), steroids (topical and systemic) as well as antibiotics have not yielded positive result. Attempt at getting others such as Tacrolimus proved abortive. Patient was referred to a center where she can be reviewed and managed by a Paediatric dermatologist but declined and was subsequently loss to follow up."
