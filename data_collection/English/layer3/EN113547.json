  "text": "A 56-year-old man underwent a total gastrectomy for stomach cancer. On postoperative Day 13, he suddenly developed presyncope, and blood tests showed hyperammonemia and high levels of serum citrulline. He was diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy. DNA analysis revealed a heterozygote mutation in Solute Carrier Family 25. Although the patient received a conservative treatment, episodes of loss of consciousness and abnormality of behavior repeatedly occurred."
