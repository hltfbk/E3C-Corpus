  "text": "A 60-year-old Japanese woman complained of left flank pain. Computed tomography with intravenously administered contrast agent showed a solid mass of 5 × 5 × 8 centimeter in the left middle abdominal quadrant. On completion of computed tomography, the working diagnosis was an impending rupture of an aneurysm located in a branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Transcatheter arterial embolization was performed, but angiography of the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery did not indicate extravasation of the contrast agent and we did not observe any aneurysmal structure. We decided to perform surgery. The operational findings revealed that the mass was a gastric intramural hematoma."
