  "text": "An 11-year-old boy presented with a history of pain in the right clavicular area for 3 months associated with swelling which gradually increased in size. The radiograph showed an expansile bony mass at the lateral fourth of the right clavicle with internal septations with thinning of the cortex and no evidence of periosteal reaction. The affected part of the lateral part of the clavicle was resected leaving the thick periosteum intact. Histologically, section revealed solid and cystic areas. The cysts were separated by septa and filled with hemorrhage and beneath the surface showed osteoid bone formation and multinucleated giant cells. Stroma showed loosely arranged spindle cells which had vesicular nuclei, inconspicuous to prominent nucleoli, and moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Prominent blood vessel proliferation was evident. Pleomorphism and mitotic figures were not seen in the specimen. The overall histological picture was that of an aneurysmal bone cyst."
