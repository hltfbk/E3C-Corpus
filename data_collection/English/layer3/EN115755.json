  "text": "A 40-year-old man with a scalp cancer was admitted for further evaluation of an occasional dry cough. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and physical examination showed no abnormalities.The chest CT scan demonstrated multiple nodular densities in the trachea and proximal bronchi. The fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed multiple nodules in the trachea suggesting a malignant infiltration.Microscopic examination of the biopsy material revealed fragments of normal cartilage and bone formation with normal mucosa which confirmed the diagnosis of TO.Patient underwent surgery for scalp cancer. For TO, case has followed up. At twelve-month follow up, scalp tumor did not recur and cough ceased."
