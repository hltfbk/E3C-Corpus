  "text": "From June to October 2017, 4 children with ovarian tumors were admitted and treated in the Department of Pediatric Surgery of People's Liberation Army General Hospital. The mean age, height, and weight of these patients were 7.5 (1-13) years old, 123.75 (71-164) cm, and 36.8 (8.5-69.5) kg, respectively. Robotic-assisted resection of ovarian tumors was performed for all 4 patients. The 3-port approach was used for robotic manipulation. The surgical procedures were as follows. After creation of the pneumoperitoneum, the robotic scope was placed to explore and find the left ovarian tumor. The trocars for robotic arms 1 and 2 were placed at the sites to the lower right and left of the port of the scope. The tumor capsule in the fallopian tube was incised, and the tumor was completely stripped by an electric hook along the junction of the tumor and the capsule. The resected tumor was completely removed using an endobag. The average docking time of the robotic system was 18.5 min, the average operative time was 120 min, and the average blood loss was 20 mL. No drainage tube was placed except in one patient with a mucinous tumor of the ovary. No fever, pelvic fluid, or intestinal obstruction was reported after surgery. No antibiotics were used during the perioperative period, and the average length of hospital stay after surgery was 3 d."
