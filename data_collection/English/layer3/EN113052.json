  "text": "A 17-year-old man presented with 6 months of blurry vision in both eyes. He was diagnosed with bilateral pars planitis. Progressive, intraretinal bone crepuscule pigmentation developed in his left retina during the following three months. An electroretinogram showed subnormal response only in the left eye, suggesting the diagnosis of unilateral pseudoRP."
