  "text": "A 91-year-old woman underwent ERC for a symptomatic large CBD stone with a diameter of 50 mm. She was referred to our institution after the failure of lithotomy by ERC, and after undergoing percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. We attempted to fragment the stone by transhepatic cholangioscopy using EHL. However, the stones were too large and partly soft clay-like for lithotripsy. Next, we attempted lithotomy with ERC and cholangioscopy by the rendezvous technique using a nasal endoscope and achieved complete lithotomy. No complication was observed at the end of this procedure."
