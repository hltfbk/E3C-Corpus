  "text": "A 68-year-old patient, operated in 2010 for squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx classified T1bN0M0, he received a partial laryngectomy with crico-hyoid-epiglotto-pexie (CHEP). The suites were simple, the resection margins were negative but with a poorly differentiated character and perineural invasion on histological examination. Regular control was unremarkable.\nFive years later, the patient presented progressive dyspnea, the endoscopic examination of the larynx showed a right arytenoid edema filling the homolateral piriform sinus with no suspicious lesion. A cervical scanner has objectified a right hypopharyngeal process coming in contact with the right primary carotid artery; multiple biopsies performed twice were negative.\nA month later, the patient a rebel cervical spine pain and a heaviness of the upper limbs, in front of which a cerebro-cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested objectifying a right hypopharyngeal process, suspicious right internal jugular lymphadenopathy (level III) of about 1cm, with a cocardial nodule of the cervical spinal cord taking the contrast evoking secondary localizations. Cervicotomy was made and the histological result was in favor of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The Positron Emission Tomographyâ€“Computed Tomography (PET-CT) requested in staging confirmed the medullary localization, with no other secondary sites. Cervical spinal cord radiotherapy (30Gy in 10 fractions) associated with corticosteroid therapy was started followed by palliative chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and docetaxel. The patient died three months after the diagnosis of MIM."
