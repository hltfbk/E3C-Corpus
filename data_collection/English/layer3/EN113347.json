  "text": "We found a 13.6-cm hypovascular tumor in the left hepatic lobe of a 68-year-old man, which we initially diagnosed as a mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Left lobe and caudate resection was performed without major intraoperative or postoperative complications. He was discharged home on postoperative day 9 and had no recurrence for 6Â months. Pathological examination showed a mucous lobulated tumor with abundant mucus in the cytoplasm and extracellular regions. After differential diagnosis that considered invasive intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct and metastatic liver tumors from the digestive tract, this tumor was diagnosed as a cholangiocarcinoma rare variant: primary mucinous carcinoma of the liver."
