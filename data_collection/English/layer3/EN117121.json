  "text": "We report a case of primary choriocarcinoma of the renal pelvis in a 38-year-old Greek woman of reproductive age, presenting with a sudden development of intracerebral hemorrhage due to metastatic lesions. The diagnosis was established with a renal biopsy, along with an elevated serum level of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. An extensive diagnostic work up confirmed the origin of the choriocarcinoma to be the renal pelvis."
