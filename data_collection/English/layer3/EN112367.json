  "text": "The patient is a 52-year-old female diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma treated with mastectomy and chemotherapy. After 12 months, she presented to the emergency department with right upper quadrant pain and elevated liver chemistries. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography showed periportal and gallbladder wall edema. After cholecystectomy, the resected gallbladder was histologically considered to be a metastatic lesion arising from the primary lung cancer. The second case describes a case of a 77-year-old woman with multiple co-morbidities who presented to the hospital with sepsis secondary to biliary source. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography findings were concerning for acute cholecystitis. After cholecystectomy, the pathology of the resected gallbladder demonstrated cholecystitis and plasmacytoma."
