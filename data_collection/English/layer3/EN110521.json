  "text": "A 14-year-old boy, consulted for a persistent and painful total hematuria 3 months before consultation. There was no personal nor family history of benign or malignant disease, nor an exposition to passive smoking, chemotherapy, radiation or chemical toxics. Physical examination revealed a normal abdominal and genitourinary examination. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a 12x11x7 mm sized bladder mass beside the left urethral orifice without vascularization. The results of a complete blood count, liver function, and renal function tests were within normal limits. The urine test revealed only hematuria, and urine cytology showed no evidence of malignancy. A computed tomography scan revealed a single bladder mass of 10 mm without enlargement of the lymph nodes or metastasis. The biopsy concluded to an urothelial carcinoma grade II pTa without stromal invasion. Transurethral resection of the bladder mass was performed. The tumor was characterized by uniformly enlarged nuclei with moderate differences in shape, and chromatin distribution. The tumor didn't invade sub-epithelial connective tissue and the muscle was not removed. The histopathology concluded to a non-invasive (pTa), low grade (GII), papillary urothelial carcinoma. No adjuvant treatment was needed. The child is currently asymptomatic and followed-up with ultrasonography and cystoscopy. Patient is alive free of disease with a follow-up of 36 months."
