  "text": "A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of chest tightness, palpitations and dyspnoea after activity. An echocardiogram performed by our hospital showed rheumatic heart disease (severe mitral stenosis and regurgitation) with normal cardiac function and wall motion. After mitral valve replacement, this patient developed heart failure with low blood pressure and tachycardia. Urgent bedside echocardiography demonstrated akinesis in the middle and apical segments of the left ventricle and a depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 36%. Myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) showed similar enhancement intensity in the basal, middle and apical segments. Quantitative analysis showed approximately equivalent maximum intensity in these regions. The diagnosis was considered TCM instead of myocardial infarction. Then, an intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted to maintain effective circulation and reduce the postcardiac load. Given ventilation therapy, postoperative anticoagulation therapy and anti-infection treatment, the patient recovered quickly. In the follow-up examination, the patient remained asymptomatic and showed normalization of ventricular wall motion in the apical segment."
