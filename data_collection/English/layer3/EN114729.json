  "text": "In this case report we present a case of radial nerve palsy after setting up an adjuvant hinged external fixator in a complex fracture-dislocation of the elbow. The patient was a 39-year-old white man. A revision of his radial nerve was undertaken at 7 weeks. A radial nerve injury at two levels facing the humeral apex pins was found intraoperatively; the pins were carefully removed and partial nerve grafts done. The functional outcome at 18 months was excellent."
