  "text": "We report the case of a 60 years old patient without significant medical history, who presented a macroscopic haematuria. The etiology was a cavernous hemangioma of the bladder confirmed by histological examination of transurethral endoscopic resection chips.\nTwo years later, irritative lower urinary tract symptoms led to the realization of an ultrasound that reveals an echogen mass in the dome of the bladder. The same hypervascular mass was indicated at the same side in abdominal pelvic MRI. It contains fluid central areas that can correspond either to necrosis or vascular ectasia. There is an extra-bladder invasion but no ganglions. The upper urinary tract was normal.\nBimanual examinations were performed. There was no adhesion to the pelvic wall.\nAn open supra-trigonal partial cystectomy with a safe margin was performed by an intraperitoneal approach associated with an augmentation cystoplasty.\nThe postoperative follow-up was favorable.\nHistopathological study confirmed the angiomatous nature of the tumoral mass."
