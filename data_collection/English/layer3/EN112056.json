  "text": "A 27-year-old woman, diagnosed with ROHHAD syndrome at age 15, who previously developed diabetes insipidus, growth hormone deficiency, hyperprolactinemia, and hypothyroidism in her first decade of life. This was followed by insulin resistance, NAFLD, liver fibrosis, and splenomegaly before age 14 years. Her regimen included a short course of growth hormone, and cyclic estrogen and progesterone. Her metabolic deterioration continued despite treatment with metformin. Interestingly, she had a favorable response to liraglutide therapy despite having a centrally mediated cause for her obesity. At age 26, a 1.6 cm lesion was found incidentally in her liver. Liver biopsy showed hepatocellular carcinoma which was successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation."
