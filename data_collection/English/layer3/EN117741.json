  "text": "We intented to present the case of a 62 years old Turkish woman with a history of slowly growing scalp mass after the trauma, especially during last 15 years. After surgical evaluation, histopathological slides exhibited the characteristic structures of proliferating trichilemmal tumour. The patient was lost to follow-up and no recurrens or distance metastasis detected during 40 months follow-up."
