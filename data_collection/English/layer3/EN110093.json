  "text": "A 56 year old woman was followed, for 20 years, for ileocaecal Crohn disease complicated with stenosis. A corticosteroid pulse therapy was administered to induce remission. In 2000, a surgical treatment consisting of an ileocaecal resection was performed due to an acute intestinal obstruction caused by the terminal ileum stenosis. During surgery, liver was macroscopically normal. In the post-operative, Budesonide therapy was immediately initiated. The disease remained quiescent and regular laboratory controls including serum transaminases were normal.\nIn 2006, the patient was treated with AZA in doses of 2mg/kg/j. She remained free of endoscopic and clinical recurrence until 2010 when she underwent reoperation for adhesions bowel obstruction. She had a new resection of the ileum. At laparotomy, the liver was macroscopically fibrosed. A surgical hepatic biopsy specimen was taken for histological examination and confirmed liver cirrhosis. Liver function tests were normal. Viral liver diseases were ruled out by laboratory parameters. Autoimmune diseases of the liver are also unlikely in the absence of autoantibodies. Then, AZA therapy (4 years) was believed to be the causative factor of cirrhosis."
