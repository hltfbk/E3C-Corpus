  "text": "A 35-year-old pregnant woman presented with loss of vision and metamorphopsia in her left eye. Fundus examination showed subfoveal severe exudation with a posterior pole serous detachment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed macular neurosensory detachment with central highly reflective sub-retinal material. Multimodal fundus pictures and angiograms revealed distinct clinical features of the disease during both the acute and final phase. The disease spontaneously resolved after delivery with regression of the subretinal fluid and the disappearance of subfoveal exudates. Nevertheless, because of severe atrophic macular changes and subfoveal fibrosis, no improvement of visual acuity was noted."
