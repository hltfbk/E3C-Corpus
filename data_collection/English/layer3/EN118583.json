  "text": "We report a case of a 62 year-old man with long-term stable control of metastatic GIST with systemic therapy, presented with an apparent intra-abdominal progression but not supported by imaging with positron emission tomography. Subsequent resection of the intra-abdominal tumor identified a non-malignant fibroid."
