  "text": "We report a case of 30â€‰year old female who was admitted due to the persistent anaemia. Whole body computed tomography scan revealed abdominal mass in her left upper abdominal compartment. Surgery on the mass originating from jejunum was performed, although due to extremely complicated postoperative period and rapid dissemination no additional therapy had been performed. The tumour was positive for CD99, ERG, CD56, Synaptophysin, PanCK, Cam5.2."
