  "text": "We present a case of a 22-year-old male with medically refractory epilepsy. During passage of an anterior medial temporal strip electrode, resistance was encountered despite multiple attempts and redirection. This strip was abandoned. During the subsequent resection operation, a large temporopolar bridging vein complex was noted and photographed precisely where we encountered resistance."
