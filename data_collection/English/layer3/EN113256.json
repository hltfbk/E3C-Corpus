  "text": "A 23-year-old women patient was emergency sent from General Hospital Tešanj due to a crisis of consciousness and repeated epileptic seizures. The patient had a second birth before 10 days (postpartum cesarean) in general endotracheal anaesthesia (two cesarean-born babies). On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cranium described both sides of the symmetrically frontal, parietal (and pre-ventricular gyri) and occipitally visible T2W/FLAIR hyperintensity focuses on the cortex and the thin layer of white mass subcortically. In the projection of the lesions parts, discrete DWI hyperintensity is seen without a reliable ADC correlate. The patient improved after management with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, antiepileptics and monitoring of blood pressure. According to latest experiences delayed diagnosis and treatment may lead to mortality or irreversible neurological deficit. Aggravating circumstances are differential diagnoses that include cerebral infarction (ischemic, haemorrhage), venous thrombosis, vasculitis, pontine or extrapontine myelinolysis."
