  "text": "A 48-year-old female was admitted to casualty with a history of abdominal distension and vomiting of 3Â days duration. An abdominal X-ray supine film showed multiple small bowel loops with air fluid levels. On surgery she was found to have a transmesocolic hernia. The defect in the transverse mesocolon was repaired."
