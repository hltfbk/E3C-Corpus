  "text": "A 28-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to the emergency department of a local hospital after experiencing acute abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography revealed massive ascites and the presence of a cystic tumor measuring 60 mm in diameter in the pancreatic tail. Conservative therapy with antibiotics and abdominal drainage were performed to treat peritonitis that occurred secondary to the ruptured pancreatic cystic tumor, after which the patient's symptoms improved. The patient was referred to our department for further examination and treatment. We diagnosed a ruptured MCN and performed laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Histopathological findings revealed ovarian-type stroma, which tested positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors by immunohistochemistry. The histopathological diagnosis was MCA. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient remains alive without any evidence of recurrence at 8 years postoperatively."
