  "text": "We report the case of a 50-year-old Caucasian man who developed symptoms suggestive of posterior circulation stroke after he was exposed to methyl iodide at his workplace. Results of stroke investigations of our patient were negative, and a detailed occupational history clinched the diagnosis. Acute presentation with a stroke-like picture is rare in cases of methyl iodide poisoning. We have attempted to discuss the differential diagnosis of stroke mimics through a review of literature."
