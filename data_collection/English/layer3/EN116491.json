  "text": "We present monozygotic female twins developing consecutively Graves' disease within five years. One year before the diagnosis of Graves' disease was established in the first twin, the mother developed a toxic thyroid nodule with hyperthyroidism leading to hemi thyroidectomy. Both the mother and the twins were cigarette smokers. The twins were treated with carbamizole and this therapy led to normalization of thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroxine."
