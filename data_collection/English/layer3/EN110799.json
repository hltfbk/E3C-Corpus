  "text": "A 7-year-old boy presented with leukocoria and acute glaucoma in his right eye. Imaging suggested characteristics of mixed PHPV. Surgical treatment and pathological examination were performed due to the presence of acute glaucoma and abnormal lens morphology. Typical signs of posterior PHPV (e.g., eyeball shrinkage, the presence of vascular membranes connected to the optic disc, etc.) were not observed. However, there were abundant fibrous vascular membranes around the lens. Pathological examination revealed fibrocyte proliferation in the lens and capsular tissue. Intraoperative findings were used in conjunction with the results of pathological and ophthalmological examinations to make the final diagnosis of anterior PHPV."
