  "text": "A 15-year-old female patient came to our emergency department with complains of generalized abdominal pain and tenderness in the past two days along with fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and generalized weakness. The patient had a history of germinoma two years ago that was treated using open tumor removal surgery, gamma knife radiosurgery and chemotherapy. VP shunt was also placed due to obstructive hydrocephalus. The patient was then sent for whole abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan and the result was suggestive for parappendicular abscess along with free fluid in the pelvic cavity. Explorative laparotomy was then carried out which showed that there was a perforated appendix with pus around it. Post-surgery, the patient was diagnosed with sepsis. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was then carried out due to loss of consciousness and sepsis. MRI results were suggestive for ventriculitis, periventricular abscess and multiple cerebral abscesses. An EVD was carried out. Culture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peritoneal fluid on MacConkey were both positive for A. baumannii (polymyxin B susceptibility was not tested) and were found to be resistant to 19 of the 20 drugs tested except for tigecycline (MIC = 1Î¼g/ml) (Table 1). For this patient, meropenem 1g intravenous every 8 hours was started as empirical therapy. With this available data, a few days later antibiotic therapy was changed to intravenous tigecycline (100mg first then 50mg every 12 hours) without intraventricular administration. Repeated CSF culture still revealed XDR-A. baumnaii in which the patient did not show any significant clinical improvement and passed away after a while."
