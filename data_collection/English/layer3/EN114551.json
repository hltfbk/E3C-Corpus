  "text": "A 63-year-old man with redness, pain, and swelling of the left leg lasting for more than 1 month was referred to our hospital. Ultrasonography revealed a thrombus in the left femoral vein. Computed tomographic angiography revealed clots in the distal right pulmonary artery. Thus, the anticoagulant treatment was initiated with subcutaneous injections of fondaparinux (7.5 mg) for 5 consecutive days, followed by once daily oral administration of edoxaban (60 mg). After 3 months of treatment, a regression of thrombotic clots was shown. Three months later, the remaining clots disappeared, leaving only mural thrombi; no bleeding complications were observed during the treatment period."
