  "text": "A case of a 48-year-old woman was presented with hemiplegia and slurred speech. The magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed acute cerebral infarction in the right basal ganglia region, semi-oval center, insular lobe, and frontal parietal lobe. The electrocardiogram showed inverted \"P\" waves in L1 and AVL on left-sided chest leads and computed tomography scan of the chest showed bronchiectasis changes, cardiac shadow and apex on the right side, and situs inversus of aortic arch position. The digital subtraction angiography showed inversion of the aortic arch, and bilateral internal carotid arteries are occluded from the ophthalmic segment. The clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings made the diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome and moyamoya syndrome. The whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis showed a homozygotic nonsense mutation in DNAH5 gene, and heterozygotic missense mutation in the DNAH11 gene."
