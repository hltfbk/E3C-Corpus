  "text": "A 42-year-old man presented for evaluation of abdominal pain and distention for approximately 2 wk. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a pancreatic pseudocyst located in the tail of the pancreas. EUS-guided pancreatic pseudocyst was performed. After stent placement, massive bleeding was noted from the fistula. Finally, hemostasis was successfully achieved using hemostatic forceps within the fistula."
