  "text": "A 24-year-old male referred with chief complaints of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting from 1 month prior to admission. Computed tomography showed a large liver mass in the left lobe of the liver with involvement of retrohepatic inferior vena cava (IVC), in favor of hepatocellular carcinoma. After hepatectomy, the common bile duct was completely removed. A 4-cm Dacron graft was anastomosed to the inferior and top of the IVC. A temporary portocaval shunt was placed, and ex situ resection of the left lobe of the liver was done. Remnant of the liver was implanted. Reconstruction of the bile duct was done using a Roux-en-Y technique, and autotransplantation of the liver was then completed. During a 4-year follow-up, the patient had no complaints and is in good conditions."
