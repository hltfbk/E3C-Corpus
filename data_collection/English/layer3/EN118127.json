  "text": "We report a rare case of secondary gastroparesis due to gastroptosis in an 11-year-old female child. The patient complained for bulking mass in the left lower quadrate presented a week ago, which was mimicking a large abdominal hernia. The laboratory and radiological exams revealed an excessive gastroptosis associated with gastroparesis. We searched the literature but we failed to find other cases with idiopathic gastroptosis in a child. The patient was treated conservatively and six months after the initial diagnosis and treatment the patient does not complains for dyspepsia."
