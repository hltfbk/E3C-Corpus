  "text": "A consecutive case series of four eyes with serous and hemorrhagic choroidal detachments secondary to cataract surgery or trauma was documented to evaluate the feasibility of using a sub-Tenon's urokinase injection-assisted 23-gauge and 20-gauge incision to drain choroidal detachments. Urokinase (2000 IU) was given by sub-Tenon's injection one day before surgery for clot liquefaction. A 23-gauge infusion line was placed in the anterior chamber. A 20-gauge incision was created in the suprachoroidal space 3.5 mm from the limbus. After drainage, pars plana vitrectomy was performed because of concomitant pathology that demanded this additional procedure. Visual acuity, ocular findings, the timing of surgical interventions, surgical procedures, and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed in four patients. Postoperative follow-up of the patients ranged from 6 to 24 mo (mean, 13 mo). After the treatment, all patients achieved excellent anatomical recovery."
