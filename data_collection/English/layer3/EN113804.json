  "text": "A 46-year-old Nepalese man presented to the hospital with a history of tingling and weakness of right upper and lower limbs that developed over a period of two months. Clinical evaluation showed diminished power across all major muscle groups in the right upper and lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging of his cervical spine showed T1 iso- to hypointense signal and T2 hyperintense signal in central cervical spinal cord from first to sixth cervical level, probably suggestive of myelitis or demyelination. The patient was immediately started on intravenous methylprednisolone. The diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica was later confirmed with strongly positive neuromyelitis optica immunoglobulin G."
