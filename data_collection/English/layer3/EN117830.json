  "text": "A 29-year-old Caucasian man presented with asymmetrical walking pattern and progressive pain in his leg, which was severely injured and amputated seven years before. A firm swelling of soft tissue with calcifications was localized in the stump. Roentgenogram and MRI showed a retained surgical sponge with calcifications. Open surgery was performed and a well-encapsulated, brownish soft-tissue tumour containing serous fluid was found in which the remnants of a surgical sponge of 40 x 40 centimeters was identified and removed. Infectious complications characterized the postoperative course for which multiple surgical procedures were needed to create a definitive healing of the stump."
