  "text": "A 30-years-old female Turkish patient had a history of a dentoalveolar trauma and a surgical operation. Her main complaints were about the unpleasant appearance of her anterior teeth. The maxillary anterior teeth were positioned labially and had irregularities in vertical position inharmonious with each other and the horizontal plane. The misplaced sector treated with minimally invasive dentin bonded porcelain laminate veneers."
