  "text": "A 65-year-old Japanese male with an advanced rectal cancer tumor with para-aortic lymph node metastasis was admitted. We performed a low anterior resection with lymphadenectomy, but the intraoperative frozen-section analysis of margins revealed malignant cell positivity; we, therefore, performed an abdominoperineal resection. Pathological findings showed that the maximum extent of distal spread was 6 cm. After 12 courses of FOLFOX4 as adjuvant chemotherapy, abdominal computed tomography revealed whole lymph node metastases, including Virchow's node. Though FOLFIRI + panitumumab was started, he was not eligible for additional chemotherapy after 10 cycles."
