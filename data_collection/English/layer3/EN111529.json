  "text": "The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), diagnosed in 1993 after presenting with recurrent renal calculi and hypercalcemia. Soon thereafter, he presented with symptoms and elevated gastrin levels suggestive of ZES prompting abdominal exploration with partial resection of the duodenum to remove gastrinoma tumor nodules. Within 4 years of the operation, he represented with intractable hypergastrinemia despite optimal medical management with peak gastrin levels exceeding 29,000 pg/mL, in 2006. In January 2007, the patient returned to the operating room for resection of regional peripancreatic and perigastric lymph nodes and enucleation of pancreatic body and tail gastrinoma tumors. Although his gastrin level decreased to 5000 pg/mL with resultant improvement of symptoms, in less than 2 years, he developed disease progression with obstructive symptomatology from enlarging gastric carcinoids and rising gastrin levels. In May of 2008, he underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and near-total gastrectomy. Since June of 2008, the patient shows no demonstrable progression of disease and remains asymptomatic on LAR octreotide (30 mgs). Gastrin levels have been well controlled (range, 100-624 pg/mL; current 114 pg/mL)."
