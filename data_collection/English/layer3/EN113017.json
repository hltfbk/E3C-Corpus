  "text": "(Case 1) A 44-year-old married woman was diagnosed with recurrent ovarian cancer. CT images indicated the recurrent nodules and masses in the pelvic cavity and the upper middle abdominal peritoneum. The CR image showed that the multiple metastatic lesions and lymph nodes could not be completely removed by reoperation. The patient agreed to receive continued chemotherapy. (Case 2) A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to abdominal distension and defecation that had increased for 6 months, with aggravation over the past 3 days. CT examination found cystic and solid masses in the bilateral ovarian area. The CR image demonstrated that the ovarian mass violated the posterior wall of the bladder and the anterior rectal wall. The preoperational imaging evaluation ensured the safety of the operation."
