  "text": "A 67-year-old man admitted to the hospital was diagnosed with sigmoid colon cancer that had spread to the left psoas muscle. Multiple hepatic metastases were also found, and combination chemotherapy with irinotecan and S-1 was administered. Four months after the initiation of chemotherapy, the patient developed gait disturbance and high fever and was therefore admitted to the emergency department of our hospital. Blood examination revealed generalized inflammation with a high C-reactive protein level. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed gas and fluid collection in the retroperitoneum adjacent to the sigmoid colon cancer. The abscess was locally drained under computed tomographic guidance; however, the infection continued to spread and necrotizing fasciitis developed. Consequently, emergent debridement was performed. The patient recovered well, and the primary tumor was resected after remission of the local inflammation."
