  "text": "We report the case of a 60-year-old male Caucasian German dialysis patient who complained of dry cough, swelling of his right arm and facial edema. Computed tomography venography showed a near-total stenosis of his brachiocephalic vein. We discuss the incidence and risk of central vein stenosis in patients on dialysis and report on a successful minimally invasive interventional treatment."
