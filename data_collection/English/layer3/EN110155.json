He underwent abdomen and pelvis ultrasound for assessment of ascitis, which showed localized fluid collections identified at the left iliac fossa with volume approximately 74 ml and right iliac fossa with volume approximately 48 ml. After that, non enhanced abdomen and pelvis CT scan was performed and showed heterogeneous organized collections identified along the right and left psoas muscles causing focal contour bulge representing hematoma, the volume is reaching approximately up to 100 ml on the right side and 150 ml on the left side. There is minimal fat stranding surrounding the psoas muscles, more significant on the left side."
