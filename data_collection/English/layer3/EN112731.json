  "text": "A handmade bovine three-portion pericardial patch was used to reconstruct the AMC in a patient with severe endocarditis requiring double valve replacement; the technique allowed for steady anchorage of prosthetic valves without additional incisions other than conventional aortotomy and atriotomy. Postoperative echocardiography revealed normal cardiac function and no significant perivalvular leakage. The patient displayed complete recovery and was discharged on postoperative day 33. The patient was symptom-free at his 1-year follow-up and displayed normal laboratory and echocardiographic findings."
