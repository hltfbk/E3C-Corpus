  "text": "12 weeks after aortic valve replacement surgery, a 60-year-old female patient was referred for evaluation of recent onset of severe chest pain on mild exertion and at rest. Coronary angiography showed severe stenosis involving the left coronary ostium and the left main stem. The patient was urgently referred for bypass surgery and had an uneventful postoperative recovery."
