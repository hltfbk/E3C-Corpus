  "text": "A 66-year-old Chinese male patient had chest squeezing at rest for more than 30 years. He had a history of cigarette smoking for more than 40 years and hypertension for 10 years. Before presenting at our institution, the patient had undergone coronary angiography 4 times and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures twice at other hospitals without a diagnosis of coronary artery spasm. However, his chest symptoms worsened. Spontaneous multivessel coronary artery spasm occurred during IVUS without provocation testing, and the IVUS image was recorded. Thus, the diagnosis of multifocal spontaneous coronary artery spasm was confirmed. The patient was placed on oral diltiazem, isosorbide mononitrate, and nicorandil to suppress coronary artery spasms. All medications were given at the maximum dosages tolerated by the patient. He was discharged after 5 d without complications. During the six-month follow-up period, the patient was symptom-free."
