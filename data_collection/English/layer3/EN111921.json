  "text": "In 5 patients operated in our hospital with the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism and non-concordant ultrasonography and Sestamibi scan, we used a 780 nm Light Emitting Diode (LED) to stimulate the cervical area. The resulting autofluorescence was visualized with night vision goggles with a 832 nm filter assembled. In all the five patients, an easily distinguishable nodule was identified and excised, and confirmed as parathyroid adenoma by histological exam. Intra-operative PTH assay showed significant decrease compared with basal values, fulfilling the Miami Criteria for surgical success in use in our institution."
