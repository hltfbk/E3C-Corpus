  "text": "A 9 year old boy with disseminated Ewing Sarcoma presented with extremity pain not responsive to a combination of opiates, gabapentin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Clodronate, a bisphosphonate, was added to the regimen to treat bone pain. It was given subcutaneously every 4 weeks with a good response and no side effects."
