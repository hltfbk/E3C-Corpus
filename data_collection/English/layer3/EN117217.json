  "text": "A 26-year-old Caucasian man presented with headache, nausea and vomiting and was found to have hydrocephalus and meningitis. Brain imaging and immunological studies were suggestive of neurocysticercosis. Endoscopic removal of the cyst resulted in resolution of symptoms. This case represents a combination of two rare presentations of extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis; intraventricular neurocysticercosis and subarachnoid neurocysticercosis."
