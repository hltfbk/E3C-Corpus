  "text": "We report an incidentally detected giant adrenal lipoma in a 43-year-old Asian man with a six year history of hypertension. He had a myocardial infarction one year earlier, for which he was taking an antiplatelet agent in addition to antihypertensive medication.The tumor was detected by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and was a large, well-defined, altered signal intensity lesion 12 cm in size in the right suprarenal region. The tumor was resected laparoscopically and sent for histopathologic evaluation. It measured 15 cm × 11.5 cm × 6.5 cm on gross examination, weighed 810 g and had a homogenous yellow cut surface. The postoperative course was smooth. Microscopy revealed mature adipose tissue with myxoid degeneration. Over the course of a four month follow-up the patient recovered."
