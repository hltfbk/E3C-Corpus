  "text": "We present here a case of a 23 years old male patient who presented to us with untreated congenital hallux varus of secondary type. Patient had an extra great toe (polydactyly) with syndactyly. We have treated this patient in two stages. First stage consisted of excision of the extra great toe and gradual correction of medial great toe. In second stage, metatarsophalangeal joint fusion was done. We have follow up of this case for more than 2.5 years."
