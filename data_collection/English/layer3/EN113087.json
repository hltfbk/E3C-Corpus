  "text": "The case was a 71-year-old woman with abdominal distention. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a huge mass in her abdominal cavity. Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed FDG uptake not only in the pelvic tumor but also in the hepatic nodule, thus suggesting metastases. We performed a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and an omentectomy. The pathological diagnosis showed clear cell carcinoma of the right ovary which arose from the MCT with malignant transformation pT2aNXM1. Although the patient underwent chemotherapy, she died after 17Â months."
