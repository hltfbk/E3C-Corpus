  "text": "A 67-year-old man fell from a 3-m-high ladder and was injured and transported to our hospital. No pericardial effusion was observed on focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) or plain CT on arrival, but pericardial effusion was detected on follow-up observation. Thereafter, his circulatory dynamics began to deteriorate. We then performed FAST to identify the bleeding source, but it was difficult to visualize on echocardiography. Thus, contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) was performed and extravasation was confirmed in the pericardium. We believed that the accumulation of pericardial effusion caused cardiac tamponade; hence, we performed emergent thoracotomy. When we released the cardiac tamponade, his circulatory dynamics improved, and we could stabilize the patient's condition by ligating the bleeding vessel from the pericardium."
