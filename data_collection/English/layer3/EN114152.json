  "text": "A 15-year-old, male castrated, domestic shorthair cat presented for persistent labored breathing presumptively due to congestive heart failure despite treatment with diuretics for 7 days. Echocardiography showed evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with severe pulmonary hypertension; however, a normal sized left atrium was not consistent with congestive heart failure. Thoracic computed tomography was performed and showed evidence of diffuse ill-defined nodular ground glass opacities, enlarged pulmonary arteries, and filling defects consistent with pulmonary thromboembolism. The cat acutely decompensated after a single dose of sildenafil and was euthanized. Histopathology of the lungs showed severe multifocal alveolar capillary proliferation with respiratory bronchiolar infiltration, marked type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and multifocal pulmonary arterial thrombosis."
