  "text": "A 23-year-old male presented following a motor vehicle accident (MVA). He was bradycardic and hypotensive during transportation; and required intubation. There were contusions along the right chest wall with clear breath sounds, and no jugular venous distension, muffled heart sounds. Hemodynamic status progressively worsened, ultimately leading to his death. However, no external sources of bleeding or evidence of cardiac tamponade was found."
