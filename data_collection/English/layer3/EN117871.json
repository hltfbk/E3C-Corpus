  "text": "An 85-year-old woman presented with left upper quadrant pain. During her evaluation, a computed tomography scan revealed intraparenchymal splenic masses. An elective splenectomy was performed, during which ovarian cancer, which had not been revealed by the pre-operative computed tomography, was detected. There was no involvement of the splenic capsule by direct extension of the tumor, as is usually the case for ovarian cancer, but only intraparenchymal metastases. This mode of metastasis to the spleen has been described but is quite rare, and ovarian cancer presenting as a splenic mass is even more so."
