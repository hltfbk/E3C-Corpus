  "text": "A young woman with ankylosing spondylitis developed a severe and complex cutaneous reaction after 6 months of otherwise successful treatment with certolizumab. The diagnosis of a rare paradoxical cutaneous reaction post anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha treatment was based on overlapping features of pyoderma gangrenosum and palmoplantar pustular psoriasis. Alopecia developed and there was also nail involvement. Treatment proved to be challenging as the disease did not remit after the patient ceased treatment with certolizumab. The patient was started on a combination of secukinumab and methotrexate to control the symptoms, with a promising outcome."
