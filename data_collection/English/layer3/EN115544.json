  "text": "In this report, we describe color Doppler ultrasound findings in two cases. Patient 1 was a 37-year-old Arabic man with a scrotal mass and a double testicle in the right hemiscrotum visualized by ultrasound. Patient 2 was an 11-year-old Arabic boy with an inguinal mass resulted to be an additional testicle in the inguinal canal. The echogenic texture and vascular flow of supernumerary testicles in question were similar to those of the normal testicles; however, their size was smaller. After 3 years of follow-up, the tertiary testes in the two patients remained stable in both size and echogenicity."
