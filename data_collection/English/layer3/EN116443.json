  "text": "We report the case of an embolic cerebral ischemic event in a 53-year-old Caucasian woman whose investigations revealed findings suggestive of possible May-Thurner syndrome coupled with an atrial septal defect. Her atrial septal defect was closed, she was placed on aspirin therapy, and has not had any recurrent events."
