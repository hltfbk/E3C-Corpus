  "text": "We present a case of simultaneous lunate dislocation in one wrist and perilunate fracture dislocation (Scapho- capitate syndrome) in the contralateral wrist which occurred simultaneously in a young male following a two wheeler accident. The injury was missed initially at the primary treating centre. Upon diagnosis, the patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation along with ligament repair. The patient was subsequently followed up for a period of four years and was found to have very good clinical and radiological outcome."
