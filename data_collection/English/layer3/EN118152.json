  "text": "We present the case of a 56-year-old Chinese female with underlying hepatitis B virus infection, who was found to have multiple hepatic tumors by abdominal ultrasound and an elevated level of serum alpha-fetoprotein. Hepatocellular carcinoma was considered based on the image findings, the elevated level of serum alpha-fetoprotein. and underlying hepatitis B virus infection. Moreover, the subsequent endoscopy revealed gastric tumor. However, the tumor histology of the stomach and liver revealed glandular adenocarcinoma with hepatoid foci. The final diagnosis is hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach with liver metastasis."
