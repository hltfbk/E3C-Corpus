  "text": "A 75-year-old Japanese man with lung squamous cell carcinoma was administered nivolumab as second-line treatment. Two months after treatment with nivolumab, he presented acute paralysis in the bilateral lower limbs, sensory loss. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging showed T2 hyperintense lesions between C5-6 and Th12-L1. He was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) by anti-aquaporin-4 antibody-positive in the serum and other examinations. After treatment, steroid reactivity was poor."
