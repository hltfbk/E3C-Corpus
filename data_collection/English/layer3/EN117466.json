  "text": "A 73-year-old man was found to have a 15-mm nodular shadow in the left lung on computed tomography, and bronchoscopic brush cytology yielded a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Chest computed tomography showed no evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Left lower lobectomy with hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed. Postoperative histopathological examination revealed squamous cell carcinoma and no lymph node metastasis. On the other hand, a lobar bronchial lymph node presented a small lesion showing the dense proliferation of capillary blood vessels with elastic change. Immunohistochemically, the lesion was positive for factor VIII and CD34, leading to a diagnosis of primary hemangioma of the lymph node."
