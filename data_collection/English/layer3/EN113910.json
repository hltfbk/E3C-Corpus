  "text": "We report the case of an 88-year-old male patient presenting to the dermatology clinic for a sharply demarcated, pink, exophytic cutaneous tumour situated in the left inguinal region. The histopathological examination performed after complete surgical excision of the lesion revealed a diagnosis of FeP. A systematic review of the literature was conducted. The terms `fibroepithelioma` and `Pinkus` have been searched in bibliographical databases, including PubMed and Google Scholar, without time limitation up to February 15th, 2017. Seventy-nine articles that fulfilled all the required conditions were identified. Relevant citations and additional articles identified from references have been assessed. The systematic review included a total number of 452 cases of FeP."
