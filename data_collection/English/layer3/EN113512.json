  "text": "A 56-year-old man from Hainan Island (China) with a history of phacoemulsification and type II diabetes mellitus underwent intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. He later presented with progressive endophthalmitis in his right eye. IOL explantation with capsular bag removal and a 23G pars plana vitrectomy combined with a silicone oil tamponade was performed. The infection was cleared without recurrence, and the patient's visual acuity improved from light perception to 20/200 in the right eye. An in vitro culture determined that the causative pathogen was Earliella scabrosa, and this result was confirmed by an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis."
