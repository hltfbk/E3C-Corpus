  "text": "We present the case of an 85-year-old Caucasian woman on warfarin, who developed a massive retropharyngeal haematoma after a fall. She initially presented with pulmonary oedema and Type 2 respiratory failure. She was commenced on treatment for this with a good clinical response. She subsequently deteriorated, developing stridor and bruising to the neck. She was urgently intubated and ventilated. Computerized Tomography scan showed a massive retropharyngeal haematoma. The baseline International Normalized Ratio (INR) was 4.9. The patients was managed conservatively and treated with Vitamin K and Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCCs). The INR was rapidly corrected to 1.1 and the patient made a full recovery."
