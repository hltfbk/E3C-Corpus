  "text": "We report the case of a 61-year-old Caucasian woman who was treated with adalimumab for spondylarthritis and developed injection site reactions after the sixth dose. After a two-month suspension, she recommenced therapy and experienced two systemic reactions. The first occurred after one hour with itching of the palms and soles and angioedema of the tongue and lips. Thirty minutes after the next dose the patient had itching of the palms and soles with diffusion to her whole body, angioedema of the lips, dizziness and visual disturbances. A skin-prick test and intra-dermal tests with adalimumab gave strong positive results at the immediate reading. However, serum-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to adalimumab were not detectable by using Phadia solid phase, especially harvested for this case, in collaboration with our Immunology and Allergy Laboratory Unit. Her total IgE concentration was 6.4 kU/L."
