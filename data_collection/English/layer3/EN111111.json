  "text": "A 17 year-old Tanzanian male with known SCD was admitted to Muhimbili National Hospital, a tertiary referral centre in Dar-es-Salaam, following an attack of malaria. From 2004 to 2007 the patient had lived in USA, and from 2010 to 2016 in France where, on account of hypersplenism and episodes of splenic sequestrations, in 2014 the spleen was removed. After appropriate clinical and laboratory assessment the patient was re-started on hydroxyurea; and anti-malarial-prophylaxis with proguanil was instituted. The patient has remained well and malaria-free for the following 15 months."
