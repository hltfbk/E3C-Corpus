  "text": "A 45-year-old gentleman, farmer by occupation, belong to state of TamilNadu, type 1 diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control, presented to us with complaints of multiple joint spain which includes severe pain over left elbow followed by mild pain over bilateral knee and right ankle for past 3 months and on and off fever for past 10 days. Clinically, patient was toxic (shows features of infection). On further investigation (Magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray left elbow, bilateral knee, and right ankle), it was found to be consistent with multifocal osteomyelitis. On arthrotomy and surgical debridement of the left elbow joint followed by intra-operative pus culture shows Staphylococcus aureus growth and patient was started on intravenous cefoperazone-sulbactam 1.5 g for 2 weeks, following which symptoms reappear. 2-d echo was done to rule out infective endocarditis. Technetium 99-methyl diphosphonate (MDP) whole-body scintigraphy shows increase uptake in the left elbow, bilateral knee, and right ankle. Now heunderwent bilateral knee and right ankle arthrotomy and surgical debridement. Polymerase chain reaction for melioidosis was positive. Gram-stain shows growth of B.pseudomallei. Serial blood cultures grew Gram-negative bacilli, later identified as B. pseudomallei, and diagnosed to have melioidosis, following which he was started on injection ceftazidime 2 g TDS (Q8 hourly) for 4 weeks followed by oral cotrimoxazole for next 6 months. The patient was followed up for a period of 2 years (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) and he was found to be recovered completely with no recurrences.."
