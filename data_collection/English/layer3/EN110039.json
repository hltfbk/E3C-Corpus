  "text": "A 34-year-old woman, without history of trauma, followed for 09 years for a rheumatoid arthritis. The patient presented a chronic nuchal pain. Physical examination found a painful palpation of C1 and C2, without stiff neck and neurologic examination was normal. A lateral view of cervical spine radiograph showed an atloïdo-axoidien diastasis of 04 mm. An atloïdo-axoidien dislocation was suspected, so a computed tomography (CT) of the cervical spine was carried out and revealed calcifications of transverse and alar ligaments, surrounding the odontoid process. The spinal canal appeared normal and no dislocation C1-C2 was detected. The patient used a cervical splint with an anti-inflammatory drug and the nuchal pain decreased gradually."
