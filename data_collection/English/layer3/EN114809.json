  "text": "The authors experienced a case of ICA occlusion with persistent primitive trigeminal artery (PPTA) manifesting only as ischemia of the posterior circulation. In this case, the initial NIHSS score was high (35/42 points). Additionally, cross flow of the anterior communicating artery, ICA occlusion and basilar artery (BA) occlusion were represented on the initial head MRA. Therefore, our first impression was a presumptive diagnosis of BA occlusion. Prior head MRI/MRA performed for screening purposes, had incidentally demonstrated a right PPTA. Based on this understanding, we were able to determine the exact angioarchitectural mechanism of the ICA occlusion. Because of the presence of the PPTA, successful recanalization was accomplished expeditiously."
