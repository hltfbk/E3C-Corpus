  "text": "A 68 year old HIV-positive male presented with a herpetic corneal ulcer which was treated unsuccessfully with acyclovir. Acyclovir sensitivity of herpes simplex virus was tested with a dye uptake assay and we found that the herpes simplex virus isolated was resistant to acyclovir. We started eye drop therapy with NGF and the corneal herpetic ulcer healed in 23 treatment days."
