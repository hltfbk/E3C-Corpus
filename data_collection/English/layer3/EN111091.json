  "text": "A 35-year-old woman, gravida 4, para 1, complained of vaginal bleeding lasting more than 1 mo and amenorrhea lasting more than 2 mo. The patient's serum human chorionic gonadotropin was 4287800 IU/L. Ultrasound showed a 11.5 cm Ã— 7.5 cm mass at the anterior lower wall of the uterus. The patient underwent suction evacuation, and partial grape-like tissue mixed with blood clots was removed. Uterine arterial embolization was performed to control intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. Histological examination confirmed the presence of a hydatidiform mole in uterine scar. After surgery, there was still a mass with heterogeneous intensity near the isthmus of the uterus on magnetic resonance imaging. The patient then underwent chemotherapy. During the 6-mo follow-up period, the mass disappeared and the serum human chorionic gonadotropin level gradually decreased to normal level."
