  "text": "A 42-year-old man presented to our department with bilateral traumatic rupture of the extensor mechanism of the knee. He had no medical history, was not taking any regular medications, and had no significant family history but a 15-year history of anterior knee pain. Both of his legs gave way on landing from a jump. Radiographs demonstrated a knee effusion with normal patella height on the left and a knee effusion with an elevated patella on the right. A diagnosis of quadriceps tendon rupture on the left and patellar ligament rupture on the right was made."
