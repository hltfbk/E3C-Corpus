  "text": "The patient was a 58-year-old man due to work as a field supervisor in the ship construction sector. He had a 40 pack-year smoking history and experienced occasional dyspnea when climbing stairs. He visited this hospital to receive cardiopulmonary function tests and to determine his ability to work. Post-bronchodilator spirometry revealed severe irreversible airway obstruction corresponding to a modified Medical Research Council grade of 2 on the dyspnea scale. His COPD Assessment Test score was 12, placing him in patient group D (high risk, more symptoms) based on the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease classification system. His maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) was determined to be 19.16 ml/kg/min, as measured by the exercise stress test, and his acceptable workload for 8 h of physical work was calculated to be 6.51 ml/kg/min. His work tasks required an oxygen demand of 6.89 ml/kg/min, which exceeded the acceptable workload calculated. Accordingly, he was advised to adjust the work tasks that were deemed inappropriate for his exercise capacity."
