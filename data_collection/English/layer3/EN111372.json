  "text": "A 36-year-old G3P3002 sexually active Cameroonian married woman reported dysuria, dyspareunia, cessation of sexual intercourse and offensive smelling vaginal discharge for 6 months and a 3-year history of a vaginal tumour; she was misdiagnosed despite ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but was corrected by an experienced radiologist. She underwent first look laparoscopy, surgical excision of the tumour through the vagina and histopathology analysis that confirmed leiomyoma."
