  "text": "A femoral lengthening nail was used to achieve goal distraction length over eight weeks and sustained a mechanical failure during progressive weightbearing. Re-distraction was attempted with subsequent non-weight-bearing status. Although the patient was not able to attain the original goal length, radiographs demonstrated stable shortening of the patient's right lower extremity along with early signs of incomplete regenerate bone. She eventually received exchange nailing with bone graft."
