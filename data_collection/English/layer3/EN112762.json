  "text": "A 30-year-old male patient admitted in our institute with complaints of severe pain in the right index finger with inability to extend the distal interphalangeal joint (DIP) for 5 days. There was a history of fall from the bike before this complaint. Radiographs revealed a bony mallet fracture involving more than one-third of the articular surface of distal phalanx. The patient was taken up for delta wiring fixation of the fracture. Radiographic bony union was seen at 7 weeks. At the final follow-up at 1 year, DIP had 75° of flexion and had extension deficit of 5°. According to Crawford's criteria, the patient had good results with a VAS score of 1 with no pain."
