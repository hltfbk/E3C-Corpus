  "text": "A 52-year-old Japanese woman presented with a mass in her left breast. The 10â€‰cm tumor was fixed to her chest wall on examination. A skin biopsy was performed which showed leiomyosarcoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given and the tumor became mobile. A mastectomy and axillary dissection were performed with surgically negative margins. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the amount of necrosis was profoundly influenced by chemotherapy, and the histological effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was assessed in reference to pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy magnetic resonance imaging."
