  "text": "We report about an infant with recurrent episodes of wheezy bronchitis, which persisted despite adequate therapy. Bronchoscopy and computed tomography of the lung with three-dimensional reconstruction revealed a rare bronchial branching anomaly - the so called \"bridging bronchus\". In contrast to previous case reports, this infant showed no additional malformations, which seems to be important for the prognosis."
