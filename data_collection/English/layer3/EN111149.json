  "text": "A 63-year-old man undergoing CAPD was admitted to the emergency room due to general weakness, fever, and abdominal pain with hazy dialysate. Two days before admission, he had eaten raw fish. Initial laboratory tests including peritoneal fluid analysis suggested peritonitis. Despite empirical intraperitoneal antibiotic treatment, his fever did not subside, and multiple vesicles on the extremities newly appeared. The result of initial peritoneal fluid culture and blood cultures reported Vibrio vulnificus as the most likely causative pathogen. Hemoperfusion with polymyxin B immobilized fiber was performed to control gram-negative bacterial septicemia with antibiotics targeting the pathogenic organism. The patient recovered completely and was discharged without complications."
