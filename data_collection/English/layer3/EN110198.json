  "text": "A 66-year-old man was admitted in our outside hospital’s emergency room due to abdominal pain. He reported that in January 2014 he fell on a glass tea table, which shattered, and he landed on the broken glass. His injuries were some superficial lacerations all around the body. An abdominal x-ray was taken in supine position. He was examined by a physician, who could not feel any foreign body upon wound exploration and sutured the laceration. Fourteen months later, he developed progressive pain on left abdominal wall. The physical examination showed an old scar on the left back and a protrusion on the left hypocondrium. Blood tests were unremarkable. A lateral abdominal x-ray revealed an image that made us suspect of a possible glass shard as cause of the pain. A CT scan was made and a very large glass shard was found inside the colon, just next to the pancreas, the left kidney and the spleen. Surprisingly, due to the location of the glass shard in the transverse colon, the patient did not have any obstructive symptoms probably further delaying his presentation. Preoperative broad-spectrum antibiotics along with tetanus immunoglobulin and tetanus toxoid were administered. The patient was taken to the operating room for a laparotomy to remove the foreign body. A left subcostal incision was made. Beneath the muscle we just felt the glass, and extracted it with no difficulty under visual control of the colon. No signs of peritonitis were seen. The perforation was on the antimesenteric edge of the colon and we closed it with a lineal stapler. The postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged home on the ninth postoperative day."
