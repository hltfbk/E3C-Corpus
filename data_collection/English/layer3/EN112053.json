  "text": "Here we report the case of a 63-year old male with a complaint of left shoulder pain. The patient was diagnosed as purulent pericarditis by chest computed tomography scan and ultrasound-guided pericardiocentesis, and the pathogen of E. corrodens was identified in the pericardial fluid culture. The clinical condition of the patient deteriorated quickly, and he died right after the drainage surgery even though the pathogen was sensitive to antibiotics treatment."
