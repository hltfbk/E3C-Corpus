  "text": "We report a 49-year-old male with IMT, which seemed invading the left atrium from preoperative imaging modalities. Serological and pathological examinations from the biopsy specimen revealed high expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase expression in the tumor. On the other hand, IgG4/IgG ration in the tumor was small, where a therapeutic effect of steroid was not expected, leading to surgical treatment rather than a steroid administration. The tumor was completely resected en bloc with the right lower lobe of the lung and a part of the left atrium. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. The patient has remained recurrence free over 5â€‰years from the surgery."
