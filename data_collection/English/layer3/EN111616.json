  "text": "A 70-year-old, 50-pack-year, male smoker was diagnosed with a lung mass on a health examination. A chest CT showed a lung mass in the superior lobe of the right lung and enlarged lymph nodes in the right hilum and mediastinum. Liver and other digestive tumors were excluded. The lung mass was confirmed to be HAC by biopsy with positivity of HepPar-1. Despite erlotinib therapy, the tumor metastasized to the gingiva. Then, docetaxel and nedaplatin therapy, radiotherapy, and bevacizumab therapy were administered successively. The patient died of tumor progression 9 months after presentation."
