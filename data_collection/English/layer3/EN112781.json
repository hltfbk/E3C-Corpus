  "text": "We present a very rare case of a transient harmless anisocoria in a 23-year-old otherwise healthy female patient, who underwent in the traditionally prone position lumbosacral spinal fractures stabilization and calcaneal fracture reduction and external fixation. We describe step by step the diagnosis algorithm and we discuss detaily the differential diagnosis of the unilaterally fixed and dilated pupil. Careful stepwise medical history and examination are mandatory to establish correct diagnosis and avoid unnecessary, expensive, and potentially hazardous or invasive diagnostic testing."
