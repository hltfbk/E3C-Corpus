  "text": "We report four GJB2 and GJB6 negative deaf patients from two Iranian related families who present the associated symptoms of SLC29A3-disorder. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) using Next Generation Illumina Sequencing was used to enrich all exons of protein-coding genes as well as some other important genomic regions in one of studied patients. A novel homozygous frame-shift mutation c.307-308delTT (p.Phe103fs) in exon 3 of SLC29A3 gene was identified in a 35â€‰years old man with profound hearing loss, camptodactyly, rheumatoid arthritis and delayed puberty without any skin changes, short stature and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The mutation found was also confirmed by Sanger sequencing in other studied patients and their healthy parents. In compared to proband, however the clinical manifestations of these patients were different, indicating variable expressivity of mutant SLC29A3 gene as well as possible involvement of other modifier genes."
