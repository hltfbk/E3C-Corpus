  "text": "We report a case of a 25-year-old Sri Lankan woman presenting with features of recurrent upper small intestinal obstruction and biliary obstruction. She had clinical as well as biochemical evidence of intermittent biliary obstruction. Evidence of duodenal intussusception was found in a computed tomography enterogram and a duodenal polyp was noted as the lead point. Marked elongation and distortion of her lower common bile duct with intrahepatic duct dilatation was also noted and the ampulla was found to be on the left side of the midline pulled toward the intussusceptum. Open polypectomy and reduction of intussusception were done and she became fully asymptomatic following surgery. Histology of the resected specimen was reported as a typical \"Peutz-Jeghers polyp\". As there was not enough evidence to diagnose Peutz-Jeghers syndrome this was considered to be a sporadic Peutz-Jeghers polyp."
