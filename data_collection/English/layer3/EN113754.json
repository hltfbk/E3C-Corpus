  "text": "We report the case of a 68-year-old Asian man with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR L858R mutation, which was initially treated with gefitinib. He developed disease progression 1 year later. Re-biopsy of the right lower lobe primary lesion revealed only an EGFR L858R mutation in the absence of a T790M mutation. The patient also experienced persistent confusion and generalized fatigue, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated extensive LM. At this time, a liquid biopsy revealed an EGFR T790M mutation. Following initiation of treatment with osimertinib, the patient exhibited a rapid response with MRI of the brain showing substantial improvement of the LM after 6 months. Unfortunately, the LM recurred after 1 year at which time the patient declined further systemic chemotherapy."
