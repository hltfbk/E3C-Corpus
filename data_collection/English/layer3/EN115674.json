  "text": "A 37-year-old Japanese female was scheduled to undergo a living-donor kidney transplant from her mother. At age 25 years, she experienced renal vein thrombosis, was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus, and was subsequently treated with prednisolone and warfarin. At age 37 years, she was diagnosed with end stage kidney disease, requiring maintenance hemodialysis because of recurrent renal vein thrombosis despite taking anticoagulation therapy. The pretreatment protocol consisted of prophylactic plasmapheresis plus full anticoagulation therapy to counteract the risks of early graft thrombosis. Anticardiolipin and anti-β2-glycoprotein I IgGs were successfully removed by both double filtration plasmapheresis and plasma exchange. The allograft kidney began to function soon after transplantation. No obvious thrombotic complications were observed after transplantation, although anti-β2-glycoprotein I IgG increased to the level observed before plasmapheresis. One year after transplantation, the patient's kidney function remains stable while receiving anticoagulation therapy as well as a maintenance immunosuppressive regimen."
