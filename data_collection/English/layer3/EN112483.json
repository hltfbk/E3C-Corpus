  "text": "A 30-year-old woman with a history of LASIK surgery presented to glaucoma clinic due to uncontrolled IOP despite of maximally tolerable medical treatment. After receiving phacotrabeculectomy, IOP decreased to 3 mmHg on the first postoperative day, but again increased up to 21 mmHg and a diffuse corneal edema with cloudy flap interface was demonstrated by slit-lamp microscopy. Corneal edema was sustained even after the IOP was lowered to 14 mmHg. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography scanning of the cornea revealed a diffuse, thin fluid pocket in the corneal interface. After laser lysis of the scleral flap sutures, IOP was further decreased to 9 mmHg and interface fluid was resolved."
