  "text": "A 31-year-old Caucasian female presented to the outpatient clinic, 5 years after her last surgery, complaining of a left upper quadrant abdominal mass over the last 2 years. She had a history of 2 weight loss operations. She had no significant family history nor smoking. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a retained foreign body. On exploration, the port with 10 cm of the connected tube was found and removed through a small incision without laparotomy. The patient made an uneventful recovery."
