  "text": "A 38-year-old female, with a past medical history of arthritis and recurrent nephrolithiasis, presents with an 8-mo history of 4 firm, asymptomatic, skin-colored nodules on her left and right upper extremities and neck. Needle biopsy and post-excisional pathology report both revealed well-formed, dense, non-caseating granulomas localized to the subcutaneous tissue. Chest computed tomography revealed mild mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A diagnosis of subcutaneous sarcoidosis was made, and the lesions were surgically removed."
