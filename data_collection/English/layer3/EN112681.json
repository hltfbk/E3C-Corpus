  "text": "In this report, we present the case of SR of primary CRC in a 78-year-old man. Preoperative colonoscopy was performed, and a type 2 tumor measuring 30 mm in diameter in the transverse colon was detected. The biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Colectomy was performed 2 months after initial colonoscopy. During the surgery, only a 10-mm ulcer harboring a polypoid lesion measuring 8.5 mm was detected in the resected tissue; no other masses or carcinoma cells were seen on histological examination. Afterwards, the biopsy specimens were reanalyzed, and immunohistological analysis verified this as adenocarcinoma with stroma-infiltrating lymphocytes. Further analysis revealed a loss of two mismatch repair proteins, suggesting sporadic high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI-H)."
