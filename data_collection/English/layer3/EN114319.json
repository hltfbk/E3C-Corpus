  "text": "A 7-year-boy was brought to our department with pain in the right arm after a fall from a height about 3 hours before admission. On examination, the elbow was found to be markedly swollen with restriction of movement of the right arm. A 4-cm-wide wound was also observed on the flexural aspect of the elbow, indicating severe contamination of the fractured site. Neurological examination revealed restriction of hand movement and decreased sensations, which suggested the possibility of nerve injuries."
