  "text": "An 80-year-old woman presented with a chronic, large MH secondary to uveitis. The minimum aperture diameter of the MH was 569 μm and extensive post-inflammatory chorioretinal atrophy was present, which included the juxtafoveal region. Vitrectomy with the inverted ILM flap technique assisted by low molecular weight hyaluronic acid was performed. Three days after surgery, the MH was closed successfully, without excessive gliosis."
