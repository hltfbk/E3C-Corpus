Five months ago the patient had several episodes of hematuria prompting its consultation. The examination for admission did not find a distended bladder or palpable masses or lumbar contact. On digital rectal examination there is a stony suspect prostate being. The rest of the examination is unremarkable. An assessment was requested. An examination of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder (KUB) and CT scan were performed and revealed two prostatic stones replaced the entire gland. The retrograde cystography objectified suspicious urethral stenosis, however, a significant post void urine volume was highlighted. Blood and urine calcium phosphate levels were normal. An urethrocystoscopy showing normal urethra and no evident urethral stenosis, two giant prostatic calculi and bladder with marked trabeculation, biopsy of prostate and bladder revealed no abnormalities. The patient had a cystolithotomy; after a lower midline incision, opening of the bladder wall between two landmark son was put in place the spacers in the Hryntschak, then we have made pericervical incision we tried to extract the 2 calculations employing both prostate lobes, however their extraction through the pericervical incision was impossible, so we used a lithotripsy in situ. Infrared stone analysis revealed that it was composed of calcium phosphates."
