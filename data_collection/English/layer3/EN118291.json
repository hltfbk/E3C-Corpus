  "text": "A 7-year-old boy presented to our clinic with severe short stature. His height was 110.4 cm (-2.4 standard deviation score), with a target height of 177 cm (+0.35 standard deviation score). Height corrected for target height was -2.75 standard deviation score. He presented with mild dysmorphic facial features, hypospadias and postnatal onset of severe growth retardation. Biochemical and endocrine tests were in the normal range. The child was exposed in utero to both carbamazepine and phenobarbital."
