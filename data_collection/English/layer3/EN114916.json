  "text": "The patient was referred to our hospital at 1 month of age and was diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis (AS) by using echocardiography. Cardiac catheterization revealed moderate AS, and subsequent left ventriculography revealed discrete stenosis of the sino-tubular junction and a narrowed proximal ascending aorta. We performed a reconstructive operation for such heart defects involving novel three-sinus and ascending aorta enlargement without aortic root transection in a 6-month-old boy."
