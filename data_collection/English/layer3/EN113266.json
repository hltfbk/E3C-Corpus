  "text": "We present a rare case of gastric glomus tumor in an otherwise healthy 41-year-old female. The patient initially presented with a significant upper GI bleed requiring a 4 U PRBC transfusion for stabilization. An upper endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound identified an ulcerated, submucosal mass thought to be consistent with GI stromal tumor (GIST). Once clinically stable, she was scheduled for elective resection. However, prior to resection she experienced a second hemodynamically significant upper GI bleed and underwent emergent laparotomy with distal gastrectomy. Pathologic examination revealed a 3 cm glomus tumor."
