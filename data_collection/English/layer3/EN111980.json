  "text": "A 68-year-old SinhaleseÂ woman with a palliative self-expanding metal stent placed for an inoperable hilar cholangiocarcinoma presented with worsening obstructive jaundice. Ultrasonography showed intrahepatic duct dilatation with the self-expanding metal stent in situ. Since this was indicative of a blocked stent, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram-guided internal biliary stenting through the self-expanding metal stent was attempted and failed. Therefore, an external biliary drain was left in the dilated biliary system. Post procedure, she developed a high biliary output of 3-4 liters per day and went into oliguric acute kidney injury with metabolic acidosis, most probably due to inadequate fluid replacement and hypovolemia."
