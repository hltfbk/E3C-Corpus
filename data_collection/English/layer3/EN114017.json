  "text": "A 2-day-old neonate born after cesarean section for breech presentation in a twin pregnancy presented with restricted movements of both his arms and right leg. Infantogram revealed bilateral humerus and right femur fracture. Biochemical tests were normal, and there were no other findings on clinical examination. There was no evidence of child abuse or any positive family history. Child was splinted for 3 weeks. X-rays suggested good callus at the fracture site of the right femur and bilateral humerus fracture were united."
