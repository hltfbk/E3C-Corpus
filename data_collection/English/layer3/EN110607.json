  "text": "We report the case of a 16-year-old teenager with a chronic painful wrist and an ulnar positive variance after a post-traumatic epiphysiodesis sequela of the radius. The radius was 11mm shorter than the ulna. An anatomic reconstruction was decided with a lengthening of the radius. Pre-operative planning and patient-specific guide allowed to control an important radial lengthening, to limit the morbidity of the iliac crest bone graft harvesting, to shape the graft precisely, and to maintain a correct radial glenoid orientation despite the important soft tissue tension. Clinical and radiological results at 6 months showed a complete disappearance of pain, optimal objective and subjective functional scores, and an improvement in the distal ulnar variance (7mm). The teenager went back to sport without limitation or pain."
