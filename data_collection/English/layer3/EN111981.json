  "text": "A 54-year old Cameroonian was admitted to our primary healthcare centre with a 6-month history of a painful constriction band developing at the base of her right fifth toe. Her past history was uneventful. Based on the absence of trauma and spontaneous onset of the condition, the diagnosis of ainhum was most suggestive. She was managed surgically by excision of the band, disarticulated at right fifth metatarsophalangeal joint and skin closure. Her post-operative course after 1 year was uneventful."
