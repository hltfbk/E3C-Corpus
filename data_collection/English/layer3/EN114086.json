  "text": "Cocaine was intravenously (i.v.) administered in 16-years old female patient as a homicide attempt. Shortly after that, patient experienced series of generalised tonic-clonic seizures, was highly febrile (40Â°C), somnolent, agitated, presenting with tachycardia, tachypnea and with increased blood pressure 150/90 mmHg. Neurologic status, lumbar puncture and computerised tomography (CT) of the brain were without remarks. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was characterised with signs of diffuse encephalopathy, and acid-base analyses resulted in metabolic acidosis. Urine screening revealed the presence of cocaine and benzodiazepines. The patient presented with signs of the hepatic lesion, acute renal insufficiency (ARI), and increased D-dimers resulting from activated fibrinolysis. The patient was discharged in stable general condition after being hospitalised for 23 days."
