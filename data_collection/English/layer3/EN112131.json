  "text": "A 47-year-old man developed small intestinal obstruction and massive ascites that did not resolve with conservative management. Surgical exploration revealed a fibrous sheath covering the small-bowel, and pathologic assessment of biopsies confirmed intra-abdominal tuberculous infection. After antituberculosis therapy, the ascites has greatly diminished and the patient was functioning normally."
