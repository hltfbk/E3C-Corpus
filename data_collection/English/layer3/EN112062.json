  "text": "A 30-year-old female patient presented to our clinic with a left anterior neck mass for a few months with dysphagia. The lipoma was excised completely along with level II to IV lymphadenectomy. A very small volume chyle leak was noted intraoperatively. The drain was removed 2 weeks later only to recur in one month. A new drain was placed by interventional radiology, and the drainage resolved completely."
