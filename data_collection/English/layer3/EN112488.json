  "text": "Two eyes of two patients underwent phacoemulsification with pre-existing corneal endothelial disorders including Fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy (Patient 1) and endotheliitis (Patient 2). Topical AA was applied to both patients at least one month before and after with a frequency of four times per day. After the surgery, both eyes improved best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and there was limited human corneal endothelial cell loss without signs of corneal endothelial decompensation, such as deteriorated BCVA or persistent corneal edema during the follow-up of at least two years."
