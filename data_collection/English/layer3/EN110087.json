  "text": "A 11 year-old child was referred to our department with a 1 month history of pain in the right chest. In his past history, he had a surgery of hydatid cyst of the liver three years ago. A physical examination revealed a diminution of the breath sound in the upper right lobe without other clinical sign, and the patient was in excellent condition. The chest X-ray realised in our patient showed right upper lobe opacity and the first diagnosis suspected, within his past history and endemic aspect of hydatid disease in our region was a hydatid cyst of the lung. The patient was operated and we discovered tissular mass invading upper lobe with suspect parietal contact, we performed a complete resection of the mass with dorsal right upper lobe segmentectomy and resection of parietal pleural beside the tumour., The diagnosis of askin?s tumor was established histological on the presence of small cells with scant cytoplasm and focal necrosis, the cells were round and had scant cytoplasm with inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitotic figures were numerous. Rosettes were only focally identified, and immunohistochemistry objective that the tumor cells is positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and CD99. Our patient receives adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with good evolution. Two years after the patient died with lung, liver and bone metastasis."
