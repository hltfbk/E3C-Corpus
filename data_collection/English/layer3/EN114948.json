  "text": "A 43-year-old G2P1 Japanese woman with atypical cesarean scar syndrome had a 3-year history of secondary infertility and postmenstrual brown discharge. Laparoscopic and hysteroscopic exploration revealed a cesarean scar defect connected to a small cavity in the myometrium: this was not an endometrial cavity or a uterine diverticulum. After endoscopic excision of the cavity, the brown discharge resolved, and the patient achieved ongoing pregnancy on her third attempt at intrauterine insemination."
