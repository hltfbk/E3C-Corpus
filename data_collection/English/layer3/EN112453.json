  "text": "A 66-year-old man, who complained of upper abdominal pain, was found to have esophagogastric junctional (EGJ) tumor. He was diagnosed as having Siewert type II adenocarcinoma. In a computed tomography (CT) scan before surgery, a 10-mm aneurysm in the splenic artery was found. Thus, we performed laparo- and thoracoscopic proximal gastrectomy and lower esophagectomy for EGJ cancer and splenic artery aneurysm (SAA) resection with spleen preservation using fluorescence imaging. We confirmed sufficient blood supply to the spleen after surgery with a postoperative CT scan. The blood supply to the spleen was suspected to be from the great pancreatic artery via the pancreas and from the omental branches of the left gastroepiploic artery via the omental artery."
