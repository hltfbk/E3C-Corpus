  "text": "We present a case of a 75-year-old with a medical history of colonic carcinoma. She presented with abdominal pain and inflammatory syndrome revealing a colonic mass. Hemicolectomy was performed. Initial diagnosis was fibroblastic tumour. The patient worsened, and diagnosis of a diffuse crystal storing histiocytosis was finally done. Haematological exploration found an indolent IgG-kappa multiple myeloma. The initial treatment with conventional chemotherapy did not permit an improvement of the patient condition. Immunotherapy with anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (daratumumab) was proposed with a clinical and biological response."
