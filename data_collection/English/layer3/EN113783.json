  "text": "An 85-year-old man was brought to the Emergency Department due to vomiting, abdominal pain, and no stool passages for 2 days. His abdomen was markedly distended, and ileus pattern was observed in the plain film of abdomen. Electrocardiogram showed right axis deviation, poor R-wave progression, and diffuse ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, and cardiomegaly was observed by roentgenogram. A ventriculography showed an ejection fraction of 33% and confirmed the apical dilation consistent with TCM. He was treated with medication and discharged without remarkable adverse events. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram 4 months later showed normalization of his left ventricular systolic functions."
