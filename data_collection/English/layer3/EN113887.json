  "text": "A 52-year-old woman underwent an uneventful left THA through a posterior approach. Within 6 weeks of her surgery, she had four dislocations, managed with closed reductions. She then underwent an open revision of her acetabular component with conversion to a DM construct. 5 weeks after her revision, she had another dislocation treated with closed reduction in the operating room, with the resultant eccentric location of the femoral head in the acetabular component. Computed tomography (CT) confirmed intraprosthetic dislocation with the PE liner lodged in the gluteal tissue. She was taken to the operating room with a plan to revise her acetabular component to another DM construct, but with an increase in the anteversion despite initial anteversion being \"appropriate\" on CT imaging. Intraoperatively, the PE liner was embedded in gluteal tissue as depicted on the CT. The abductors were intact. There was no impingement in extension and maximal external rotation when trialed with a conventional head/liner construct. A new DM construct was then implanted."
