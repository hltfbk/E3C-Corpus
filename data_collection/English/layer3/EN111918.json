  "text": "Here we describe two cases, a 72-year-old Sinhalese man and a 47-year-old Tamil woman, from Sri Lanka, presenting with overt hypothyroidism; they were found to have elevated creatinine, proteinuria, and elevated creatinine kinase levels. Due to lack of active sediment in urine analysis, these patients were observed after the initiation of thyroxine therapy. They were investigated in the adult-onset proteinuria pathway, excluding common reasons for proteinuria. Both patients responded to treatment: their serum creatinine, creatinine kinase, and urine protein levels reverted to physiological levels within 6 months of treatment with thyroxine, and with normalization of thyroid-stimulating hormone."
