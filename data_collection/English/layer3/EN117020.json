  "text": "A 48-year-old Sindhi woman from Karachi, Pakistan, presented to our emergency room with a sudden onset headache and was diagnosed as having a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Digital subtraction angiography revealed hypoplasia of her internal carotid artery bilaterally with an associated fusiform aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery. Our patient declined any operative intervention in view of the associated risks. She died of a rebleed six weeks after her initial presentation."
