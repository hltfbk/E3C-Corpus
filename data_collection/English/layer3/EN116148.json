  "text": "A 25-year-old Japanese woman experienced massive atonic bleeding after delivering her second baby. Recovery from hemorrhagic shock was managed by conservative treatments, but she developed decompensated heart failure and refractory hypoxia. Because we could not obtain hemodynamic stability and proper oxygenation even with high doses of catecholamines and maximal ventilator settings, we administered venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, whereupon her hemodynamic status immediately stabilized. After 72Â hours of support without major bleeding, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was successfully withdrawn."
