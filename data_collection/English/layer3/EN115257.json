  "text": "A 75-year-old pseudophakic man with open-angle glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy developed neovascular glaucoma. After two intravitreous injections of bevacizumab and panretinal photocoagulation were administered, the new vessels regressed. However, goniosynechiae were observed over 360° of the angle. An Ahmed glaucoma valve model FP7 was implanted with the tube in the posterior chamber with adequate intraocular pressure control. Nineteen years after cataract surgery, when the IOL-CB complex became dislocated, they were sutured transclerally to the sulcus without Ahmed glaucoma valve modification. After a coughing episode, the vitreous pushed the IOL-CB complex forward and the tube was behind the IOL-CB complex. A 25-gauge posterior vitrectomy was performed, and the tube was returned to in front of the optic of the IOL using a forceps tip through a sclerotomy."
