  "text": "We present a case of a 24 year old male arrived at our hospital with dyspnea and unusual computed tomography (CT) findings of sarcoidosis. Chest X-ray and CT scan revealed multiple masses in both lungs suggesting lung metastasis. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage did not reveal any malignant cells. None of the laboratory examinations revealed any primary extrapulmonary tumor. The patient underwent CT-guided core needle biopsy. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of sarcoidosis."
