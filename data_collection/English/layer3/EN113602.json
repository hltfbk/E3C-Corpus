  "text": "We present a 51-years-old woman with relevant clinical history for breast cancer. The patient was admitted in the emergency department with jaundice, dark urine and pale stools. She was on the 10th day of hormonotherapy for recurrence of breast cancer, diagnosed 7 years previously. Usual causes of acute liver failure were excluded, all drugs were stopped and the imaging studies performed were positive only for steatosis. Nonetheless, ALF progressed and the patient died 4 days later. Autopsy demonstrated a massive intrasinusoidal infiltration of the liver by breast cancer cells."
