  "text": "We present a 47-year-old female patient with thigh pain that was diagnosed with Cowden syndrome 20 years ago and developed multiple and different skeletal metastases which became resistant to radio-chemotherapy. A percutaneous plate fixation of the distal femur with an intralesional excision and cementoplasty of the metastasis was performed initially. This was combined with a cemented total hip arthroplasty using an Exeter long revision stem and a cementoplasty of the femoral canal for the proximal lesions."
