  "text": "We present a 46-year-old female suffering from achondroplasia with severe pain in both knees. Severe varus deformities of both femurs and degeneration of both knee joints became apparent on clinical and radiological examination. On each femur, we performed one-staged, lateral closed-wedge osteotomy, and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Subsequently, the patient was relieved of knee joint pain and gained a greater range of motion."
