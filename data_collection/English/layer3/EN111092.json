  "text": "We describe the case of a 37-year-old woman who presented with a 2-year history of a tough swelling below the umbilicus, which presented periodical pain during menstruation. The patient had undergone laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy 4 years prior, and we theorized that the umbilical nodule was a complication of that laparoscopic surgery. Histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of abdominal umbilical scar endometriosis secondary to previous laparoscopic surgery. Surgical removal of the nodule followed by three cycles of leuprorelin was curative."
