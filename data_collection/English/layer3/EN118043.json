  "text": "The patient referred to our center with loin pain and progressive abdominal distention from 4 years ago. In the previous published literature, four cases of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of renal origin have been published. Abdominal CT showed complete replacement of left kidney by a large multiloculated cystic mass accompanied with multiple large nephrolithiasis. Nephrectomy was performed and histopathology revealed covering of epithelium of renal pelvis by columnar epithelium and scattered goblet cells and mucous gland."
