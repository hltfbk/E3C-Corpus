  "text": "A 39-year-old Arab man presented to our fertility clinic for fertility treatment. He was diagnosed with primary infertility, which had been present for 20â€‰years at the time of presentation. Our patient had nonspecific morphological features of an abnormally wide neck with front slouching neck posture, clinodactyly of the third finger, and had moderate hypoandrogenemic features. A semen analysis revealed azoospermia. Genetic tests for azoospermia, including sex-determining region Y (SRY) detection and chromosome Y microdeletion, revealed no deletion present on the Y chromosome. Karyotyping was used and our patient was diagnosed with 48,XXYY syndrome."
