  "text": "Here we describe a man affected by polycythemia vera (PCV) that was treated with hydroxyurea (HU) and developed PML. The initially PML presentation included ataxia as one of the main features. Brain MRI displayed widespread supratentorial and infratentorial lesions. Immunological analysis revealed absence of reactivity to a wide range of antigens. The course of disease was rapidly progressive with fatal outcome - autopsy ruled out leukemic transformation."
