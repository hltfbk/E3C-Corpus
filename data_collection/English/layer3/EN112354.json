  "text": "A 5-year-old Chinese girl exhibited exotropia in her right eye for 2 years and had been losing her vision for 6 months. The visual acuity in the right eye revealed no light perception. A fundus examination showed a large, yellowish-white, elevated, subretinal mass lesion in front of and inferior to the disc, with hemi-inferior-quadrant retinal detachment. The retina was greyish-yellow with scattered yellow spots. A vitrectomy with neoplasm resection was performed. A histopathologic examination revealed a GCT. The tumor cells were positive for CD68, NSE, S-100, and CD163 expression but negative for GFAP, Syn, and CD123 expression. The Ki-67 index was 1%. The right eye remained stable with visual acuity of no light perception at a 2-years follow-up."
