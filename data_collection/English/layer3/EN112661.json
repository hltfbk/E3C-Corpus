  "text": "A 41-year-old white woman, gravida 3, para 0, received low molecular weight heparin to reduce the risk of abortion after five unsuccessful intracytoplasmic sperm injections and two miscarriages. She autonomously discontinued the medication with low molecular weight heparin at 12 weeks and 2 days of gestation and took aspirin instead until 24 weeks and 2 days of gestation as preeclampsia prophylaxis. However, the pregnancy ended with an urgent cesarean section at 27 weeks and 4 days of gestation due to a fast progressing hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme levels, and low blood platelet count syndrome, a potentially life-threatening variant of preeclampsia."
