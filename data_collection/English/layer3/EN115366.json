  "text": "A 10-year-old, 12.3-kg, castrated male Shih Tzu presented with severe pruritus and anorexia. The diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus was made based on its history, physical examination, and histopathology results of a skin biopsy. Treatment with prednisolone and combination therapy of other immunosuppressive drugs had failed; therefore, immunosuppressive gene, CTLA4 overexpressing ATMSCs (CTLA4-ATMSCs) and/or naive ATMSCs administration was performed with the consent of the owner. ATMSCs were administered 21 times over a period of 20 months with intervals of 2 to 8 week. Prednisolone was gradually tapered concurrently and no relapse of the clinical signs was observed. After the termination of CTLA4-ATMSCs and/or naive ATMSCs treatment, the skin lesions had improved and could be managed with a low dose of prednisolone for 12 months."
