  "text": "Herein we report a case of a 64 years old patient, with a history of eumycetoma occurring ten years ago treated with oral terbinafine coupled with surgery. A complete remission was seen after 2 years. He presented a relapse on the previous scar 6 months ago. There wasn't any bone involvement in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient was put under oral terbinafine with a slow but positive outcome."
