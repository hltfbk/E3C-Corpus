  "text": "A 55-year-old female with EGFR mutation (L858R) was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma, who was responsive to first-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Afterwards, she developed acquired resistance accompanied with a ROS1 rearrangement. A NGS assay showed that the tumor had a novel ROS1-ADGRG6 rearrangement generated by the fusion of exons of 1-33 of ROS1 on chr6: q22.1 to exons of 2-26 of ADGRG6 on chr6: q24.2. The patient was obviously responsive to crizotinib."
