  "text": "The patient was a 24-year-old woman with previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis and repeated attacks of biliary colic. The postoperative course was uneventful, but computed tomography revealed a remnant cystic duct calculus. Ten months after surgery, the patient returned to our department for right hypochondriac pain. Laparoscopic remnant cystic duct resection was performed with intraoperative near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence cholangiography to visualize the common bile duct and remnant cystic duct. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 3 after surgery. At the 6-month follow-up, she had no recurrence of pain."
