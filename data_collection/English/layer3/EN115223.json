  "text": "A 76-year-old Caucasian woman presented with dilated epibulbar vessels with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP, >30 mmHg) as well as glaucomatous excavations of the optic disc in both eyes. Cerebral digital subtraction angiography revealed a CCF with bilateral orbital communication. Preoperative diurnal pressure profiling showed an average IOP of 25.8 mmHg (right eye) and 26.6 mmHg (left eye). Transluminal intervention and fistula occlusion led to a decrease in IOP of about 9 mmHg. A post-operative oculomotor nerve palsy regressed spontaneously."
