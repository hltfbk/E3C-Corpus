  "text": "A 45-year-old female underwent vaginal hysterectomy for uterine prolapse. The resected specimen showed a bluish-colored area in the non-dependent part of the ectocervix. Microscopic sections from this area showed dense lymphocytic infiltrate at the junction of mucosa and submucosa causing disruption of the basal cell layer. On immunohistochemical examination there was predominance of CD8+ T lymphocytes at the junction with scattered CD4+ T lymphocytes, characteristic of lichen planus. Based on the history and negative serum antibody titers, other differential diagnoses including lupus erythematosus and drug reaction were excluded. The patient did not have any cutaneous or oral lesions of lichen planus."
