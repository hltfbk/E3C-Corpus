  "text": "A 4-year-old boy with a history of recurrent wheezing was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of asthma based on his past medical history, persistent cough, wheezing, and airway hyperresponsiveness by lung function test. Double aortic arch was diagnosed with computed tomography angiogram. After surgery, the respiratory infection improved strikingly. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent chronic, irreversible complications."
