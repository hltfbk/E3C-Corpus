  "text": "60 years old male, known case of hypertension and diabetes was brought to the emergency department with disturbed level of consciousness and right sided hemiplegia which was progressive over four days. There were no witness's seizures. On examination, he was afebrile, conscious, not oriented to time, person or place and his mouth deviated to left side but vitally stable. The blood picture was normal besides hemoglobin level which was initially 11g/dl (13-17g/dl) but rapidly came to a low level of 8 g/dl. The power and sensation could not be assessed due to aggressive behavior of the patient. On plain CT scan of the head, there was a complex lesion with cystic and solid components and calcification along left parieto-occipital lobe associated with florid vasogenic edema. A midline shift of 0.6 cm was noted without any evidence of hydrocephalus. MRI findings showed left occipitoparietal space occupying lesion with multiple linear projections measuring approximately 5.2x4 cm. The mass was heterogeneous with a prominent peripheral rim and vasogenic edema, a cystic component anteriorly; low and bright signal intensity in T1 along with focal hemorrhagic areas in T2. The mass lesion was seen displacing the occipital horn anteriorly and inferiorly with questionable extension into the lateral ventricle. No associated midline shift or definite herniation was evident. The impression of MRI was likely glioblastoma multiforme. Presence of probable ventricular extension raised the possibility of an alternative differential diagnosis of ependymoma that was however considered less likely. The surgical intervention consisted of left occipito-parietal craniotomy with almost complete tumor resection. No complications were encountered in the post-operative period. In histopathology, the biopsy was received in neutral-buffered 10% formalin and consisted of multiple fragments of firm, tan-white tissue with lobulated surface, homogenous consistency, measuring in aggregate 4 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm. The specimen was totally submitted for histopathological evaluation. Microscopically a biphasic highly cellular neoplasm, comprising a glial component showing anastomosing islands of cells with large round to oval cells with eosinophilic, abundant cytoplasm and large atypical nuclei and prominent nucleoli was seen. This was alternated by a sarcomatous part revealing fascicles of spindle cells with atypical, highly pleomorphic nuclei (some bizarre nuclei). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the glial component to be Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) positive and the sarcomaÂ¬tous component as diffusely positive for reticulin and vimentin but negative for GFAP Figure 3."
