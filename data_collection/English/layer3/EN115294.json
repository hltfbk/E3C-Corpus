  "text": "A 28-year-old female sustained an unusual common peroneal nerve palsy manifesting contralateral drop foot after prolonged femoral nailing. Although the initial presentations were similar to the notorious well-leg compartment syndrome, a benign course with complete recovery in functions was observed 3Â months later. After neurophysiologic exam and review of pertinent literature, this iatrogenic and transient dysfunction was delineated to be position-related neuropraxia."
