  "text": "Here we report a case of osteoblastoma of talus in eighteen year old male patient from Bijapur with complaints of pain and difficulty in walking for one year. Relevant investigations and radiographs were taken. It was treated with wide excision and bone grafting from ipsilateral ilium and talo-navicular fusion with cannulated cancellous screw fixation. Histopathology of the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Patient was immobilized with below knee plaster cast for six weeks later with gradual mobilization. Guarded weight bear was allowed after three months. Patient achieved satisfactory range of movements and full weight bear mobilization after six months. Symptoms relieved with no evidence of any recurrence in one year follow up."
