  "text": "A 52 year old right electrician presented to the emergency department following a fall from a push bicycle. Plain radiographs identified a left first metacarpal (MC) fracture and a bipolar fracture of his right clavicle. Following Fracture Clinic review, significant deformity of the medial clavicle was noted and a CT scan showed anterior dislocation of the medial fragment. Given the degree of deformity and this functional requirement we felt that operative treatment was most appropriate for his unstable medial clavicle fracture dislocation."
