  "text": "A 50-year-old male patient with type 2 diabetes was observed air filling in mediastinal drainage tube, 12 days after esophagectomy for esophageal squamous carcinoma. Based on the results of computed tomography, bronchoscopy and pathology, the diagnosis of intermediate bronchial fistula caused by mediastinal drainage tube compression and fungal infection was made. Anti-fungal drug and temporary covered metallic stent was used. After stent removed, the fistula was healed with some granulation hyperplasia. He was free from respiratory symptom during 1 year follow-up."
