  "text": "We report the case of a 35-year-old woman who experienced a firm mass over the left midfoot for 5 years causing pain and numbness in the foot. Radiographs showed a geographic osteolytic lesion involving calcification of the base of the 2nd and 3rd metatarsals, cuneiforms bones and surrounding soft tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lobulated mass in the midfoot containing tangles of tortuous blood vessels and dark foci characteristic of phleboliths. Wide resection of the 2nd and 3rd cuneiforms, metatarsal bones and surrounding tissues with a curved iliac bone graft reconstruction were performed. Histological assessment revealed a lesion composed of a vascular channel containing endothelial cells with smooth muscle but without cellular atypia. The definite diagnosis was spinal cell hemangioma. The pain resolved within 4 months. The foot was stable, and no recurrence was found at the 48 months follow-up."
