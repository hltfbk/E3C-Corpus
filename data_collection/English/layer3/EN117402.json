  "text": "A 44-year-old Hispanic woman developed a non-anion gap hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis consistent with type 4 renal tubular acidosis while being treated in the hospital for recently diagnosed systemic lupus erythematosus with multi-organ involvement. She responded well to treatment with corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil. Normal renal function was achieved prior to discharge and remained normal at the patient's one-month follow-up examination."
