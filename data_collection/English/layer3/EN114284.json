  "text": "A 65-year-old lady presented to us with symptomatic gall stone disease. Investigations revealed a distended gall bladder with multiple stones. Patient was taken up for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, during surgery a stony hard structure was found at cystic duct-common bile duct junction which was not amenable for clear dissection. Procedure was converted to open, and the patient underwent cholecystectomy with resection of common bile duct with Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy and regional lymphadenectomy. Histopathological findings revealed it to be moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the cystic duct."
