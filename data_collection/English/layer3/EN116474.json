  "text": "A 63 year-old male presented in 2006 with dyspnoea on exertion having quit smoking in 2003. Clinical examination, together with high resolution computed tomography, bronchoalveolar lavage, and echocardiographic assessments, suggested a diagnosis of CPFE without PH. In 2007, the patient received intravenous cyclophosphamide, N-acetylcysteine, and short-term anticoagulation treatment. Due to remission of acute exacerbations, the patient received triple combination therapy (prednisone, N-acetylcysteine and azathioprine). Upon progressive clinical worsening, long-term supplemental oxygen therapy was initiated in 2009. Repeated right heart catheterisation in 2011 confirmed PH and worsening pulmonary haemodynamics, and off-label ambrisentan therapy was initiated. Dyspnoea remained at follow-up, although significant haemodynamic improvement was observed."
