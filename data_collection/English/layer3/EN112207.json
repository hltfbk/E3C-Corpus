  "text": "In the current report, we describe two middle-age patients who were originally diagnosed with diabetes mellitus with no classical symptoms of lung cancer. The patients were eventually diagnosed with SCLC, which was confirmed by bronchoscopic biopsy and histopathology. SCLC-associated diabetes was related to EAS, which was an endogenous ACTH-dependent form of Cushing's syndrome with elevated ACTH and cortisol levels. Multiple organ metastases were found in Patient 1, while Patient 2 retained good health at 2 years follow-up. EAS symptoms including thyroid dysfunction, hypercortisolism and glucose intolerance were all resolved after anticancer treatment."
