  "text": "A 59-year-old woman presented to our ED (emergency department) complaining of acute chest pain and dyspnea. During her presentation in ED she experienced a sudden syncope and soon developed CA (cardiac arrest). Laboratory studies showed a increase of CK-MB,troponin T,myoglobin and D-dimer. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) showed no large central or segment pulmonary emboli but increased RV (right ventricle)size,enlarged main pulmonary artery and invisible peripheral pulmonary artery. She was diagnosed with acute PE and alteplase was delivered intravenously. After thrombolytic therapy she remained hypotension and developed worsening anaemia. Detailed examination for anaemia revealed AIHA. She was discharged in a stable condition after 5â€‰weeks with methylprednisolone and warfarin. Hb, D-dimer and transthoracic echocardiography showed complete recovery at 3-months follow up."
