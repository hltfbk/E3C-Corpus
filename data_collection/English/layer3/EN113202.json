  "text": "A 26-year-old man who developed a severe abdominal pain at high altitude, found to have a tender splenomegaly. However, further inquiry revealed he is from an area where sickle cell disease is prevalent. Screening for sickle cell disease was positive. Radiological investigations confirmed a massive splenic infarction keeping with a diagnosis of splenic syndrome. Patient was managed conservatively."
