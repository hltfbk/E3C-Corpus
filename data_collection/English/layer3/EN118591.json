  "text": "A 40-year-old man presented with painful right-sided groin swelling of 1-week duration. The area was explored, with presumpted diagnosis of inguinal abscess. At exploration a femoral hernia was found which contained a mildly inflammed appendix. Appendicectomy and hernia repair was done. Post surgical course was uneventful. We present this case with brief summary of literature pertaining to such lesions."
