  "text": "We describe a case of a 60-year-old patient who was on oral bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis and developed ONJ, AFF, recurrent ONJ, and subsequent mandible fracture with delayed AFF union - this is a very unique and extremely rare case. For the same, she underwent multiple surgeries - sequestrectomy in the mandible, proximal femoral nailing for femur fracture and plate fixation for her jaw. The delayed union needed teriparatide administration. At 1 year follow-up, the patient had a complete radiological union for AFF and on recent follow-up the patient is asymptomatic as regards the femur as well as the jaw. This unique sequence of events has not been described previously."
