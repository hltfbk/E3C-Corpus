  "text": "We report the case of a 33-year-old male patient with GQ1b-seronegative BBE-GBS after two prior episodes of MFS-GBS. Our patient showed ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia and a weakness of the extremities (MFS and GBS symptoms) in all episodes. In the episode reported here, our patient showed disturbed consciousness and an extensor response to cutaneous plantar stimulation was observed (BBE symptoms), with severe disability and requirement for artificial respiration management. GSC-Abs detected in previous episodes were also detected in the subsequent episodes, while new GSC-Abs emerged in each episode. Interestingly, whereas antibodies to GA1/GQ1b and GA1/GT1a, which are commonly identified in patients with GBS, MFS or BBE, appeared in all episodes, antibodies to GD1a/GD1b and GD1b/GT1b, which are predominantly associated with severe disability and the requirement for artificial respiration management in GBS, emerged for the first time in this episode."
