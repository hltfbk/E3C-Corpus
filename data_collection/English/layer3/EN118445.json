  "text": "We report a case in a 60-year-old man. Computed tomography revealed a large, homogeneous, retroperitoneal mass with 14.8 x 11.5 cm size arising from the right kidney. An ultrasound guided percutaneous biopsy was performed and the tumour was diagnosed histopathological as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient was treated by systemic chemotherapy and thereafter a nephrectomy was performed."
