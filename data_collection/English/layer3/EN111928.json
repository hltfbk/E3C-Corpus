  "text": "The patient is a 38-year-old female with bloody discharge from the left nipple. Microscopically, the terminal-duct lobular units were enlarged and filled with tumor cells. The tumor cells were arranged in cystic, microcystic, solid and papillary pattern and formed a honeycomb-like appearance. The presence of intracellular and extracellular eosinphilic PAS-positive material was the most remarkable feature. Immunohistochemically, myoepithelial markers highlighted the complete presence of myoepithelial cells around the tumour nests. Tumour cells were strongly positive for S-100 and CK5/6, negative for ER, PR and HER2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed ETV6-NTRK3 fusion."
