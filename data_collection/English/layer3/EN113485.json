  "text": "We report the case of a 62-year-old Moroccan man diagnosed as having chondrosarcoma of his right scapula, who was irradiated 10 years ago for stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. This case was managed by a complete resection of the tumor with good functional and oncological outcomes. To the best of our knowledge, the scapular location of radiation-induced sarcoma after irradiation for lung cancer has never been described in the literature."
