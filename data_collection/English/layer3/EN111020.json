  "text": "A 30-year-old woman was treated by veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to catastrophic cardiopulmonary dysfunction after prolonged and unexplained nausea, vomiting, and cough. Myoclonus on the limbs developed afterward. Taken with suspicion of area postrema syndrome (APS), the brain MRI showed a demyelinating lesion in the medulla oblongata. APS and severe heart failure by stress cardiomyopathy were completely resolved by ECMO and hydrocortisone therapy. However, the CNS demyelinating lesion recurred after 1Â month. The patient was diagnosed with NMO evident by the presence of aquaporin-4 antibody; Steroid therapy improved her symptoms."
