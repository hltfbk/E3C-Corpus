  "text": "We present the case of a 30-year-old Hispanic woman with recurrent intracranial bleeds, in whom multiple lines of treatment had failed. She was treated with a combination of bortezomib and rituximab based on previously published data that suggested this therapy effectively blocks all antibody-producing cells. Our patient's platelet counts rapidly improved and subsequently normalized following this treatment."
