  "text": "A 30-year-old male admitted with a history of accidental fall followed by pain, swelling over his left elbow. Clinical, radiological, Doppler investigations revealed anterior dislocation of the elbow with brachial artery injury with posterior interosseous nerve palsy without any bony injury. Immediate closed reduction, primary vascular repair with fasciotomy was done following which elbow function improved."
