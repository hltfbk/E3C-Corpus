  "text": "A 60-year-old man had been suffering from longstanding right lower quadrant pain. Abdominal computed tomography showed a slight swelling of the appendix as the possible cause of his pain. Laparoscopic appendectomy with partial resection of the cecum was performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. An 18 Ã— 10-mm lesion located on the tip of the appendix was found in the resected specimen. Pathological examination showed that the lesion was covered with normal mucosa and consisted of adipose tissue, smooth muscle fibers, small vessels, and neural fibers. These findings were consistent with neuromuscular and vascular hamartoma of the appendix."
