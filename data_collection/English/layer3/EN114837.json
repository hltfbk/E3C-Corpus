  "text": "A 54-year-old woman presented with weight loss, jaundice, and pain in the epigastric and right upper quadrant of the abdomen. With extensive radiological imaging, the patient was diagnosed with periampullary tumor and Whipple's procedure was performed. The immunohistochemical analyses supported the diagnosis of primary squamous cell carcinoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged, and adjuvant chemotherapy was recommended."
