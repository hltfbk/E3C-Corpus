  "text": "A 78-year-old woman was diagnosed with a metastatic non-small-cell-lung-cancer. Following the lack of response to two lines of systemic chemotherapy, she was treated with the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab, obtaining a prolonged stable disease. Under nivolumab treatment, the patient developed a basal cell carcinoma of the nose. The latter was surgically resected. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue showed a PD-L1 expression < 1% and lack of human leukocyte antigen class I subunit (i.e. heavy and light chain) expression on tumor cells. In addition, a limited number of T cells (CD3+) was present in the tumor microenvironment, with a higher number of regulatory T cells (Foxp3+) and macrophages (Cd11b+) as compared to a low infiltration of activated cytotoxic T cells (CD8+/ Granzyme B+). Two months following the surgical removal of the tumor, while still on nivolumab treatment, the patient relapsed with a basal cell carcinoma in the same anatomic site of the previous surgical excision. The tumor displayed the same pathological characteristics."
