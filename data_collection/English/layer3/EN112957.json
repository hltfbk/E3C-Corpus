  "text": "A 19-year-old male patient presented progressive deterioration of the vision of right eye due to the presence of exudative macular detachment associated with JRCH. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) had decreased from 1.0 to 0.02. The JRCH was treated with two sessions of full-fluence PDT at an interval of 3 months. After the first PDT, the subfoveal fluid was reduced, albeit not completely disappeared. After the second PDT, the subfoveal fluid was successfully displaced. At the 1.5-year follow-up examination, no subfoveal fluid was observed at the macula, and VA improved from a pretherapy level of 0.02-0.8 at 18 months post-treatment."
