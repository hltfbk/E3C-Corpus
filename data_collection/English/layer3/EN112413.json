  "text": "A 68-year-old Japanese woman, previously diagnosed as having large AVMs, sustained a right femoral shaft fracture due to a fall. At the time of admission, she presented with massive swelling and venous varicosities of the right thigh. Plain radiography of the right thigh revealed femoral shaft fracture with bony erosion and calcification of soft tissue. We planned closed reduction and intramedullary nailing with a unilateral external fixator following embolization of the feeding artery. However, closed reduction using the fracture table was difficult. When we attempted open reduction, massive bleeding (1000 mL) after incision of subcutaneous tissue occurred. Finally, we carefully applied a Taylor Spatial Frame. Fracture displacement was corrected successfully and bony union was obtained with administration of teriparatide 15 months after the initial surgery. The patient is able to walk using 1 cane."
