  "text": "A 70-year-old Japanese man with type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed as having ST-elevation myocardial infarction. His clinical course after an urgent percutaneous coronary intervention was uneventful, but he developed electrical storm that was refractory to antiarrhythmic medications on day 11 of hospitalization. We used sedative medications and performed ventricular overdrive pacing and transferred him to a university hospital for further treatment, which included electrical ablation and cardioverter-defibrillator implantation."
