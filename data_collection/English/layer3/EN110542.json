  "text": "A 23 year old female patient presented with the chief complaint of discolored maxillary right central incisor. Patient gave the history of malaligned maxillary right central incisor and subsequent orthodontic treatment that was finished two years ago. The response to vitality tests was negative. On percussion and palpation test, patient reported mild pain. Digital periapical radiograph revealed right maxillary central incisor with obliterated canal and diffuse periapical radiolucency. The tooth had yellowish grey crown. Periodontal pocket depth was normal. A diagnosis of pulp necrosis and calcific metamorphosis was reached. After giving anesthesia and isolation, an endodontic access cavity was prepared at upper right central incisor with number 2 round diamond bur (Mani, Inc. Japan). The slit of the pulp chamber became visible and calcification was removed by using ultrasonic tip. Canal orifice was located with the help of endodontic explorer (DG-17). Patency of the canal was achieved with 08 K-hand file (Mani, Inc. Japan). The working length was measured with the radiographic method. After preparation of glide path canal was cleaned and shaped to size 30/.04 by using hyflex© CM file system (coltene). Irrigation was done by utilizing 3% sodium hypochlorite (septodont) and EDTA 15% (septodont), alternatively, with rinse of saline in between. The 27 gauge closed end side vent needle was used for irrigation. The canal was dried with sterile paper points. Obturation was done with Gutta Percha (GP) points and calcium hydroxide based sealer (sealapex, sybron endo) by using cold lateral condensation technique. Subsequently, GP was removed 2-3mm apical to canal orifice and restorative glass ionomer cement (GIC) was applied on the obturating material to minimize leakage of bleaching agent. After placing rubber dam 35% hydrogen peroxide (opalescence® endo® ultradent gel) was injected into the chamber for the management of yellowish grey crown, followed by the placement of cotton pellet and sealing of access cavity with restorative GIC (vitremer, 3M). The process was repeated three times after the interval of five days. Desired results were achieved after the third visit and patient was satisfied. Subsequently, the tooth was permanently restored with resin composite after 7 to 10 days."
