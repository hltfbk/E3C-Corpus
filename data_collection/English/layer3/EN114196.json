  "text": "A 62-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of recurrent umbilical region infection for the preceding 20 months with no symptoms of ileus. Preoperative CT and fistulography revealed an incarcerated Richter's hernia complicated by an ECF. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a loop of the distal ileum adherent to the umbilical region that was retrieved back into the abdominal cavity. Side-to-side ileo-ileal anastomosis was performed using a 75 mm linear stapler to remove the affected ileum segment. The internal hernia ring was closed using plication sutures instead of via mesh repair due to the patient's small defect and infection risk."
