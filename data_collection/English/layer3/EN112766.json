  "text": "We report a case of 22-year-old female with post-traumatic MO following head injury. The patient developed extensive MO in iliopsoas and brachialis muscle leading to complete extra-articular ankylosis of hip and stiffness of elbow which lead to severe functional disability to the patient. Hematological parameters were normal. Surgical excision of the bony mass was done in two stages- hip followed by an elbow. The patient had marked functional improvement in hip and elbow."
