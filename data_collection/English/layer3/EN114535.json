  "text": "We describe a case of a 49-year-old man with lung adenocarcinoma harboring L858R point mutation at the exon 21 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). During the maintenance treatment with EGFR-TKI, the patient presented with a right breast mass, which was accompanied by elevated serum neuron specific enolase (NSE) level. The histological examination of biopsies from the breast mass and enlarging lung mass revealed SCLC that was less sensitive to standard SCLC treatment. The breast tumor was positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), consistent with a lung primary cancer."
