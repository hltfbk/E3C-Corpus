  "text": "We report a 28-year-old HIV-uninfected Ugandan woman who had previously been well and presented with chronic bilateral panuveitis; symmetrical vitiligo patches on the head, trunk, and upper limbs; tinnitus; and poliosis of the scalp hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows. A flu-like syndrome preceded this. Several weeks of prednisolone and azathioprine therapy resulted in remarkable improvement of the ocular and inner ear symptoms."
