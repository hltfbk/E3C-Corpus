  "text": "A 57-year-old female had been diagnosed as having HCV infection in 2008. The inosine triphosphatase gene showed one single nucleotide polymorphism (rs1127354) C/C (major homozygous) and the IL28B gene showed single nucleotide polymorphism (rs8099917 T/T, rs11881222 T/T) (major homozygous). The patient was treated with pegylated interferon 180 μg once a week combined with ribavirin 600 mg per day from April 2011. The hepatitis c virus ribonucleic acid turned negative 9 weeks after treatment with pegylated interferon combined with ribavirin. During the therapy, the platelet count remained above 8.0 × 10(4)/μl for about 9 months. In January 2012, the platelet count was 6.8 × 10(4)/μl. In February 2012, the 44th week from the beginning of the treatment, a sudden decrease in the platelet count to 0.8 × 10(4)/μl was observed. After prednisolone was administered, the platelet count increased. Finally the platelet count had risen above normal range."
