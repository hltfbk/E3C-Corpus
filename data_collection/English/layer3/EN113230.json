  "text": "We report the case of a 39-year-old previously healthy male patient who presented with paraneoplastic pemphigus in the setting of a large intraperitoneal mass with no associated lymphadenopathy. The biopsy results showed a cellular proliferation of mildly to moderately atypical oval-to-spindle-shaped cells admixed with a variably dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate suggestive of FDCS versus inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. A pathology review following total resection of the abdominal mass confirmed the diagnosis of FDCS. The tumor cells showed positivity for CD35, CD21, CD45, and CD68, negative ALK staining, and limited smooth muscle actin immunoreactivity. The surgery was complicated by severe pneumonia and acidosis, resulting in a prolonged ICU stay and death."
