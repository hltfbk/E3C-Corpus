  "text": "A 46-year-old man complained of four hands 7 d after SCI. He was diagnosed with SPL complicated with actual limb neuropathic pain. Following a period of treatment with neurotrophic agents and Chinese traditional and analgesic medications, SPL symptoms and actual limb pain did not improve. However, his symptoms gradually lessened after combined treatment with high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a promising neuromodulation technique, over the M1 cortex and visual feedback. After 7 wk of this treatment, SPL disappeared completely and actual limb pain was significantly relieved."
