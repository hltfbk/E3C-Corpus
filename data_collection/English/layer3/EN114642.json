  "text": "A 40 years old gentleman presented withfracture distal end of the radius (left). On clinical examination we observed that he had anterior dislocation of his left shoulder which was confirmed on radiographic evaluation. He had history of seizures 3 years back, which may be the cause of dislocation which went unnoticed. On examination he had good range of motion without any pain. Patient could perform all routine activities with no major functional limitation. At three years after dislocation CT Scan showed neocavity formation."
