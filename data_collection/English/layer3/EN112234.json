  "text": "We describe a patient with advanced MCC successfully treated with avelumab who developed acute onset diffuse lichen planus-like keratoses (LPLK) at sites of existing seborrheic keratoses (SK) and lentigines. Histopathology of an affected SK revealed papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia with lichenoid interface changes, numerous dyskeratotic keratinocytes and intermittent hypergranulosis. The findings resembled lichen planus (LP) arising in an SK. Onset of the skin symptoms corresponded with an inflammatory cancer response (clinical pseudo-progression), and the eruption improved as overall tumor burden decreased. The patient's pruritus was treated with topical steroids and cyrotherapy for individual symptomatic lesions."
