  "text": "A rare case is reported of a 54-year-old woman who suffered from suprascapular nerve entrapment syndrome. The patient was subjected to arthroscopy of the left shoulder, where a compression of the suprascapular nerve due to an ossified superior transverse scapular ligament was diagnosed. The arthroscopic release of the suprascapular nerve brought relief from pain, weakness and atrophy of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles."
