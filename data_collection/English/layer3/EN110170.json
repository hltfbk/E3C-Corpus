  "text": "It was Mr. B P. Age from 44 years, admitted to the Emergency Department for injuries knees following an accident at work. It is a moving worker who allegedly received while working on his knees, a cab office heavy mode of injury has a direct impact on the knees at 20 degrees of flexion. Review painful swelling of the knees with a patellar shock at the level of the knees (hemarthrosis), more intense pain sitting at the level of the internal compartments of the knee.\nNo there was no vasculonervous, but important lesions of varying degrees of complications.\nThese skin lesions were at the level of medial and lateral sides of the knees. Because of the pain we had sought signs of laxity.\nThe initial AP and lateral x-rays showed a bilateral Coronal fracture of the medial condyle (left and right knee: Figure 2, Figure 3). The scanner showed Coronal fractures type Hoffa of the two medial condyles left and right associated with a fracture of the left tibia plateau. According to AO classification [2] the lesion of condyles was Type 33 -B3 and the lesion of left tibia plateau was type 41-C1.\nThe patient support was primarily a functional method by a strict bed rest; knees were immobilized in knee braces.\nLocally we had carried out regular dressings and cry therapy. Also a treatment medical was associated with painkillers, of the anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant.\nPhysiotherapy and maintains it muscle was carried out at the patient's bed.\nControl scanners were regularly (J8 and J15) made, they did not show secondary displacement.\nAfter the healing of skin lesions, we had immobilized knees by the cruro-pedious resins for 04-week. At the end of this period, we proceed with the removal of the resin. The fact of removing is able to thaw the resumption of physical therapy for a period of 6 weeks.\nNote that the patient kept splints of knees outside the rehabilitation sessions. The market and on the members support him were banned until bony healing.\nOne followed radio-clinic was undertaken externally every month until consolidation. The fuse was acquired in 3 half months.The control scanner is highlighting a perfect consolidation of bone lesions.\nAt final follow-up of 8-month functional assessment of the patient score was excellent with normal flexion, an absence of laxity, an absence of pain and an unlimited market."
