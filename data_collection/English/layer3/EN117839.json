  "text": "We present the case of a 74-year-old Greek man who was diagnosed with osteosarcoma 10 years after he had been diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder from which he had been free from recurrences for the past three years. Our patient was treated for the osteosarcoma with transurethral resection of bladder tumor and external beam radiation therapy. He died eight months after the diagnosis, suffering poor quality of life in the last months."
