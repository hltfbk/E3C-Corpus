  "text": "A 69-year-old Filipino man presented with hematuria for 1 month. A computed tomography scan demonstrated a large left kidney mass with biopsy demonstrating small cell carcinoma. Within 2 months he developed dizziness and was found to have a metastatic lesion to his brain. He was hyponatremic due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. He did not receive chemotherapy due to his poor functional status. He died within 8 months of presentation."
