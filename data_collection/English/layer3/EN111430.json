  "text": "We performed NOSE gastrectomy in a male patient. Tumor resection, digestive tract reconstruction, and lymph node dissection were performed totally laparoscopically; the specimen was extracted from the natural orifice of the rectum-anus. This procedure reduced damage to the abdominal wall and decreased postoperative pain. We successfully performed radical gastrectomy without conversion and complications. Total operative time and blood loss were 176 min and 50 mL, respectively. The patient resumed normal activities of daily living on day 1 without pain, and passed flatus within 48 h. Postoperative hospital stay was 10 d. The number of resected lymph nodes was 0/43. During the follow-up, no stricture or anastomotic leakage was detected. Three months postoperatively, colonoscopy showed full recovery of the rectum without stricture or scar contracture. Computed tomography and laboratory test results showed no signs of tumor recurrence. There was no visible scar on the abdominal wall."
