  "text": "We describe a Caucasian male baby who presented in the first months of life macrophage activation syndrome, followed by intractable colitis, recurrent episodes of fever and mild splenomegaly. After several immunological, genetic and clinical investigations, subsequently a therapeutic attempt with colectomy, analysis of VEO-IBD-associated genes, revealed a causative mutation in XIAP. The genetic diagnosis of a primary immune deficiency allowed curing the boy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."
