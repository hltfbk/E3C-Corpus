  "text": "This is a method of osteotendinous suturing that could lead to reestablishing the functional continuity of the gluteus minimus, medius muscles, and the anterior capsule through drill holes in the greater trochanter, and thereby preserve the integrity of the hip abductor musculature. This is a simple and easily reproducible technique of soft tissue approximation and reattachment that results in early mobilization and ambulation of the patient with no additional complications and have several advantages over the other methods used for closure."
