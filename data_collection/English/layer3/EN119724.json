  "text": "A 54-year-old male with an epithelioid sarcoma of the palm was treated with neoadjuvant radiation, wide excision, and two-stage reconstruction. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was used to stage the patient's axilla. Sentinel node biopsy results were negative. The patient has remained free of local, regional and distant disease for the follow-up time of 16 months."
