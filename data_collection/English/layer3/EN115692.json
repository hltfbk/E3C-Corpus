  "text": "We present a 30-year old male with prolonged multisystem organ failure after bilateral lung transplantation, in whom during a period of 254 days the cumulative difference between expected and actual need for calcium infusion was 14.25 mol, representing an estimated calcium loss of about 571 g. Comparison of computed tomographic imaging of the lower thoracic vertebrae over this period depicts a radiographically discernible decrease in bone density from 238 to 52 Hounsfield Units. The first spontaneous fracture occurred after 6 months of immobilisation. Despite subsequent treatment with bisphosphonates and androgen therapy resulting in an increase in bone density to 90 HU a further fracture occurred."
