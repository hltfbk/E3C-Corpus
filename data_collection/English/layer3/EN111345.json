  "text": "A 63-year-old female patient presented with the classical triad of symptoms for Meniere's disease (fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss in the right ear, tinnitus and fullness in the same ear and rotary vertigo), two years later complained of brief episodes of vertigo linked to changes in head position relative to gravity. Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre showed a classical response in the head-hanging right position. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in the same ear was diagnosed in this patient. After treatment with Epley's canal repositioning manoeuvre for a few days, the symptoms of positional vertigo resolved."
