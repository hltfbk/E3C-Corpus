  "text": "A 50-year-old Caucasian American man with history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was admitted status post fall and loss of consciousness for an unknown duration. Initial work-up revealed severe rhabdomyolysis, opioid abuse and acute renal failure. Inspite of three days of intensive therapy his condition did not improve and his renal failure worsened. On improvement of his condition three days later, he indicated some discomfort in his right hip. Physical examination was significant for swelling of the right gluteal region, which was tender and firm on palpation. A non-contrast CT scan showed evidence of gluteal compartment syndrome and emergent surgery resulted in significant improvement of his condition."
