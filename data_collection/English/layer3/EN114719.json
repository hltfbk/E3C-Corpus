  "text": "Herein, we present a rare case of a 40-year-old woman with ICVT and type II protein S (PS) deficiency, who experienced a stroke. She initially presented with generalized convulsions. A CT scan showed intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the left temporoparietal region. However, her condition rapidly deteriorated and she went into a coma approximately 20Â h after admission. A second CT scan revealed significant ICH expansion and transfalcine herniation. Decompressive hemicraniectomy with duraplasty was performed, and ICVT was confirmed owing to abnormal vascular tone and black appearance of the cortical vein. She underwent anticoagulation therapy and rehabilitation, and gradually recovered."
