  "text": "We report a case of a 71-year-old white French man with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia who presented with acute renal failure and hyperviscosity syndrome. His Waldenström's macroglobulinemia was refractory to first-line treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone. Because of his hemorrhagic syndrome and medical history of recent myocardial infarction, we decided to treat him with idelalisib 150 mg twice daily instead of ibrutinib. We observed a very quick improvement in the patient's clinical status without need for dose adjustment."
