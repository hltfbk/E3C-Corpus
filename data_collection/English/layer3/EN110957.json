  "text": "Here, we present the case of a patient with a three-year history of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia. The patient most recently visited the hospital with abdominal distension and swelling of the left leg. His mother told us that she was diagnosed with TSC one year previously, which alerted us because the patient had multiple regions of pigmentation. To evaluate the condition of the child and make a definite diagnosis, multiple imaging examinations were performed, as was TSC gene analysis. The results met the diagnostic criteria for TSC. The patient was discharged after symptomatic treatment. Through a review of the literature, it can be seen that changes at the molecular gene level of TSC can lead to abnormal lymphatic vessels."
