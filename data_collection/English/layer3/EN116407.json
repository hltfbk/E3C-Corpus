  "text": "We report a 39-year-old woman with primary Sjögren's syndrome presenting with intracranial hemorrhage. The diagnosis of primary Sjögren's syndrome was based on the presence of ocular dryness, salivary gland secretory and excretory dysfunction confirmed with dynamic tracer emission CT, and positive anti-Sjögren's syndrome A and anti-Sjögren's syndrome B antibodies."
