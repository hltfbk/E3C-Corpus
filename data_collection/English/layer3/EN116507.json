  "text": "A 56-year-old Caucasian woman was referred for interventional treatment of an advanced local recurrence of endometrial cancer (11.9 × 11.6 × 14.9cm) with infiltration of the sacral bone and nerve plexus. Due to the immediate proximity to the sacral plexus, the patient could neither undergo surgical therapy nor a second radiation therapy. Due to its ablation mechanism irreversible electroporation was deemed to be the best therapy option."
