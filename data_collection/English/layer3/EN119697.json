  "text": "A 51-year-old female presented with a pancreatic mass incidentally found on the abdominal computed tomography. She underwent distal pancreatectomy. The sectioned surface of the pancreas revealed a circumscribed, whitish gray ovoid firm mass with some cystic spaces. Microscopically, glandular or small cystic structures were scattered in the predominant stroma creating a solid appearance. The subepithelial stromal component was composed of cytologically bland looking spindle cells, which resembled ovarian stroma. The stromal cells were reactive to CD 34, vimentin, progesterone receptor and calretinin. The microscopy was consistent with mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas."
