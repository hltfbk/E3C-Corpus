  "text": "In 2011, a 91-year-old woman presented a thick melanoma of her cheek. The lateral sections revealed persisting in situ melanoma, which were again excised. She presented for follow-up and a recurrent MIS was evidenced centered on the previous scar. She refused further surgery and ingenol mebutate (0.015% gel) was administered on three consecutive days. One month later, a complete clinical resolution was observed. Histology and immunohistology revealed no residual MIS."
