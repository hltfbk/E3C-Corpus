  "text": "A 30 year - old male patient presenting with pain to the upper abdomen due to a large FNH was managed with TAE. Routine radiographic control on post-intervention day one was within normal limits. Imaging due to right upper quadrant pain with fever and elevated inflammatory markers and liver enzymes on day two after TAE revealed a marked reduction of the FNH accompanied by the presence of a large volume of gas collection without signs of abscess formation. This change of state from solid to gas without sign of abscess formation within 2 days after TAE was described as hepatic tissue sublimation. The patient was managed conservatively and discharge 12 days after TAE."
