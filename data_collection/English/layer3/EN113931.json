  "text": "A 25-year-old nulligravida woman presented with malodorous vaginal discharge and was diagnosed to have an exophytic cervical SCNEC. A magnetic resonance image scan showed no evidence of parametrial invasion or distant metastasis. Clinical staging allocated her to stage IB1 disease. She underwent radical abdominal trachelectomy for reproductive purpose. Preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy with ifosfamide/etoposide/cisplatin combining gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist were administered. She had a spontaneous, uneventful pregnancy and successfully delivered a term baby via cesarean section 7Â years after treatment."
