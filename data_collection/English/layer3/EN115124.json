  "text": "A 58-year-old left-handed man with a history of refractory CD who had fever of over 38 Â°C, progression of CD symptoms, and Gerstmann's syndrome consulted our hospital. Laboratory data showed elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP) and hypoproteinemia. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a right parietal high-intensity lesion. Catheter angiography showed segmental multiple narrowing and occlusion in the distal part of the middle cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery. Angiography also revealed multiple venous occlusions in the affected parietal area. To confirm the diagnosis, the patient underwent open biopsy, and histological examination revealed cerebral vasculitis. The patient was then started on high-dose prednisolone (60 mg/day) in addition to his previous therapy, which included mesalazine, adalimumab, and azathioprine. CRP elevation, hypoproteinemia, and gastrointestinal symptoms immediately improved after starting this treatment. Neurological status improved simultaneously with CD symptom improvement, and follow-up brain MRI revealed a reduction in the size of the right parietal lobe lesion. He returned to normal status and was discharged from our hospital 5 weeks after admission."
