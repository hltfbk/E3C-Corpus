  "text": "A 70-year-old man with rectal cancer was presented to our hospital. He had an ALTA injection 2 months before presentation at a clinic due to hematochezia with internal hemorrhoids. The rectal tumor was located 7 cm above the anal verge, and Rob-LAR with the da Vinci Xi system was performed. The patient had sclerosis on the stump of the anal side, which made it difficult to transect the rectum with linear staplers. This required multiple repeats of compression through the SmartClamp feedback. After anastomosis with the double-stapling technique, we constructed a diverting ileostomy."
