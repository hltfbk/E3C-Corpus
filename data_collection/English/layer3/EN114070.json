  "text": "We report six consecutive patients, presented with distal biceps tendon rupture (4 acute; 2 chronic cases) between June 2013 and March 2015, who underwent single-incision, anatomical distal biceps tenodesis procedure with bicortical EndoButton and tenodesis screw using tension slide technique. Radiographs were taken immediate post-operative to document for displacement or loosening of EndoButton if any."
