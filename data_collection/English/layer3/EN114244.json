  "text": "A 74-year-old woman presented with a right thyroid mass. The nodule was approximately 2 cm in size and was diagnosed as an indeterminate lesion by fine needle aspiration cytology. She was treated with thyroid lobectomy. The histopathological and immunohistochemical findings indicated an EHE of the thyroid. At the latest follow-up, 3 years postoperatively, the patient showed no signs of recurrence."
