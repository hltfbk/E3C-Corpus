  "text": "Both individuals presented as neonates with unexplained, marked lactic acidosis suggesting a primary mitochondrial disorder. Within the first weeks of life, elevated blood lactate levels normalized. Their clinical and developmental outcomes were normal. Biochemical studies in the proband showed multiple abnormalities consistent with a complex IV respiratory chain defect. Cultured skin fibroblasts showed an elevated lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, deficient complex IV activity, and normal pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase activities. Whole-exome sequencing of the proband and both parents did not identify a causative mutation."
