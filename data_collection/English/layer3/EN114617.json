  "text": "We present the case of a 29 years old man who was diagnosed with melorheostosis affecting his left foot. The patient presented to the outpatient department of our tertiary care referral hospital with complains of pain in the left ankle and foot with imaging and evaluation done at a primary center. The radiograph revealed an irregular, longitudinal extraosseous hyperostosis along the body of the calcaneum and the metacarpals which was consistent with the classical radiological description of melorheostosis. The CT, MRI and bone scan findings corroborated our primary diagnosis."
