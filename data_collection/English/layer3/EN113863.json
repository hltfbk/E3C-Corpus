  "text": "A 66-year-old female underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction and an intrathoracic anastomosis for esophageal cancer. Three years later, she had hematemesis and was diagnosed with a gastro-aortic fistula due to a gastric ulcer. She underwent endovascular aortic repair urgently at another hospital. Two days later, she underwent total resection of the gastric tube, during which time an injury to the trachea occurred; it was repaired by patching the stump of the esophagus to the injury site. Two months later, descending aortic replacement was performed due to infection of the stent graft. Six months after the first operation, a TEF developed. The patient was referred to our hospital for further treatment. The fistula was ligated and divided via a cervical approach, and a pectoralis major muscle flap was used to cover the defect. Esophageal reconstruction with the pedunculated jejunum was performed via a subcutaneous route. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged after 6Â months of physical and dysphagia rehabilitation."
