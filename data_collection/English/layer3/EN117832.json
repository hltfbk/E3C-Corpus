  "text": "The author reported a male patient aged 56 years presented to the emergency department with acute upper abdominal pain. Widespread variable sized serosal intestinal air cysts were seen at the first look involving long segment of jejunum and ileum. Perforated duodenal ulcer, as the cause of generalized peritonitis, was repaired with direct closure and omental patch. A second laparotomy, was done and exploration was systematically performed and denoted hugely distended stomach with cicatrisation at the site of previous closure of perforated duodenal ulcer and the whole length of small gut was completely free from the already described pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis."
