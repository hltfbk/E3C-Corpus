  "text": "Here we present a case in which pneumothorax occurred as a first manifestation of lung cancer. The chest x-ray of a 68 year old man revealed a right partial pneumothorax. VATS was then performed: the visceral pleura lying over segment S3 was destroyed and air leaks were found in this section. Pathologic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed non-small cell carcinoma. Thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis was performed."
