  "text": "A 43-year-old Sinhalese woman with a history of anovulatory subfertility for 5 years presented with heavy menstrual bleeding and secondary dysmenorrhea of 6 months' duration. Imaging (pelvic ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis) revealed a hemorrhagic cyst (6 × 4 cm) on the right side and a multilocular cyst with solid areas (10 × 7 cm) on the left side. Her cancer antigen 125 level was 2715 U/ml. Following a multidisciplinary team meeting, a fertility-sparing staging laparotomy was performed, which included right cystectomy, left oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy, and peritoneal washings. Histology revealed a mucinous cystadenoma of the right ovary and a mature cystic teratoma on the left ovary. No malignant cells were observed in peritoneal washings. The patient's cancer antigen 125 level dropped to 74.8 U/ml 1 month after surgery."
