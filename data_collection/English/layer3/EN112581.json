  "text": "We report on a 15-year-old girl suffering from MPS IVA. At the age of 5 years, hip pain and a reduced walking distance were described for the 1sttime. At the age of 9 years, acetabulofemoral dysplasia associated with genuavalga was diagnosed. After pre-operative assessment of the hips including plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and arthrography with dynamic testing a valgization osteotomy of the proximal femur in combination with a shelf acetabuloplasty was performed. The patient was followed for 6 years with a stable hip joint and without any sign of redislocation."
