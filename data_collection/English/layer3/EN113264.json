  "text": "We present a 71-year-old man complained of cough and fever. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed the aneurysmal dilated CS with the band medium-echo mobile structure. A sinus venosus atrial septal defect has been detected. He had a persistent left superior vena cava which drained the right atrium via the aneurysmal dilated CS. Blood cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. After intravenous antibiotic therapy, he had the symptom of dyspnea. The suspicious diagnosis is recurrent septic lung emboli which was confirmed by thoracic contrast enhanced computed tomography. The thoracotomy was performed to repair the atrial septum and remove the CS vegetation. Ten days later, the patient was discharged with only mild cough."
