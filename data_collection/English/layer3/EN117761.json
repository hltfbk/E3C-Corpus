  "text": "A 55-year-old Caucasian man presented with symptoms of pyelonephritis with an obstructing ureteral stone. A nephrostomy was performed. During an injection of contrast agent in his left caliceal system, his left renal vein was visualized. A repeat pyelography with an injection contrast material at low pressure failed to show the same finding. This radiological finding is due to the occurrence of \"pyelovenous backflow\"."
