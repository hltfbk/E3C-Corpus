  "text": "A 60-year-old man with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure and dyslipidemia was admitted for a right shoulder rotator cuff tear. He underwent right-shoulder arthroscopy and rotator cuff repair. About three weeks later, he developed pain, swelling and purulent drainage from his right shoulder. Arthroscopic irrigation and drainage was then performed. Intraoperative fluid revealed the presence of Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus spp. and Serratia marcescens. The patient had no known allergies. After reviewing his antimicrobial susceptibility, he was started on vancomycin 1500 mgs intravenously every 12 hours (to treat both Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp) and ciprofloxacin 750 mgs by oral induction every 12 hours. The patient's condition improved following antibiotic treatment. He was discharged and allowed to go home on IV vancomycin and oral ciprofloxacin. The patient's platelet count on the day of starting vancomycin therapy was 253 x 10(3)/mm(3). At weeks one, two and three, the counts were 231 x 10(3)/mm(3), 272 x 10(3)/mm and 6 x 103/mm(3), respectively. The patient was admitted for further work-up of the thrombocytopenia. He was later shown to have vancomycin-induced platelet-reactive antibodies, causing significant thrombocytopenia, and then reversal after his vancomycin medication was discontinued."
