  "text": "A 32-year-old male presented with a symptomatic right intrathoracic mass, which was confirmed to be a lipomatous tumor using computed tomography. A penduculated tumor originating from the mediastinal pleura was resected through the conventional right posterior thoracotomy. Pathological examination indicated a diagnosis of fibrolipoma."
