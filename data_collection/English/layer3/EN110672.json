  "text": "We report the case of a 53-year-old heavily pretreated patient with melanoma who developed Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) 19 days after ACT using autologous TILs, given in the context of a phase I trial. He presented with dorsal back pain, unsteady gait and numbness in hands and feet. Lumbar puncture showed albuminocytological dissociation, and nerve conduction studies revealed prolonged distal motor latencies in median, ulnar, tibial and peroneal nerves, compatible with a GBS. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and intensive neurological rehabilitation, with progressive and full recovery at 21 months post-TIL-ACT. Concomitant to the onset of GBS, a cytomegalovirus reactivation on immunosuppression was detected and considered as the most plausible cause of this neurological side effect."
