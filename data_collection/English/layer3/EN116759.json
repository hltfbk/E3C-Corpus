  "text": "A 53-year-old Spanish woman who had undergone a laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis for the correction of myopia in her right and left eye (10 years ago) was referred to our department with a complaint of decreased visual acuity in both eyes. A fundoscopy and optical coherence tomography examination revealed a bilateral full-thickness macular hole. A 23-gauge sutureless pars plana vitrectomy was performed in both eyes, and 1 month after surgery her visual acuity improved and the hole closed."
