  "text": "In this case presentation, we demonstrated a rare case report describing the accidental discovery of a right atrial mass-like structure in a 54-year old Asian man without physical discomfort during an echocardiographic examination. These findings naturally caused some concern as the differential diagnosis such as right atrial myxoma or thrombus and further examination were organized. The subsequent positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) differentiated a true right atrial mass from a strip extending into the atrium in accordance with prominent crista terminalis."
