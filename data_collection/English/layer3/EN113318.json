  "text": "One patient with detention of fish bone stuck in the esophagus developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Computed tomography results revealed that two high-density foreign bodies migrated extraluminally and caused abscess confined in the mediastinum. Multidisplinary collaborative efforts of anesthesiology, gastroenterology and thoracic surgery were made to optimize the therapeutic process. By taking advantages of wide working channel and better exposure of video-mediastinoscopy, two sharp fish bones were removed with minimal risk of injuring adjacent important tissues, furthermore, complete debridement of the abscess and precise drainage tube indwelling was achieved simultaneously. Postoperative comprehensive therapy including anti-infection and nutrition support guaranteed a smooth transition of perioperative period."
