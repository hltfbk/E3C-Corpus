  "text": "We report a rare association of bilateral keratoconus and unilateral essential iris atrophy in a 38-year-old man. Diagnosis of bilateral keratoconus was confirmed by corneal topography. Slit-lamp examination showed extensive iris atrophy with corectopia and policoria in one eye. Corneal specular microscopy revealed an abnormal endothelium morphology in the same eye with extensive peripheral anterior synechiae and closure of the drainage angle at gonioscopy. Intraocular pressure was 26â€‰mmHg, despite maximal topical therapy. Optic disc examination showed severe glaucomatous cupping. Surgery by glaucoma drainage device implantation was performed."
