  "text": "A 46-year-old woman with anemia for two years was frequently admitted to the local hospital. Upon examination, anemia was attributed to gastrointestinal tract bleeding, which resulted from duodenal variceal bleeding detected by repeated esophagogastroduodenoscopy. At the end of a complete workup, IPH leading to duodenal varices was diagnosed. Portal venography revealed that the remarked duodenal varices originated from the proximal superior mesenteric vein. TIPS plus embolization with coils and Histoacryl was performed to obliterate the rupture of duodenal varices. The anemia resolved, and the duodenal varices completely vanished by 2 mo after the initial operation."
