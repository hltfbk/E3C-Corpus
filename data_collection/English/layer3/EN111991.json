  "text": "A 13-year-old Oromo girl presented with a progressively increasing right upper abdominal mass of 3 years' duration. She had dull dragging pain and an occasional low-grade fever. On examination she had 20 × 20 cm mass with well-defined medial and inferior border. Both ultrasound and computed tomography scan showed a highly vascularized mass arising from her right adrenal gland but she had neither the constitutional symptoms of a functional adrenal tumor nor an abnormal biochemical test. Surgical resection showed a vascularized mass with attachments to the right lobe of the liver with a weight of 1900 g. It was found to be a giant solitary fibrous tumor of her right adrenal gland with infrequent mitosis. She stayed for 5 days after surgery and was discharged. She showed remarkable recovery at follow-up at 3 months."
