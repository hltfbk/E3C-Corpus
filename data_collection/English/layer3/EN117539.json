  "text": "A three-week old African-American male neonate was diagnosed with acute liver failure secondary to neonatal hemochromatosis. Living-related liver transplantation was considered after the failure of intensive medical therapy. Intra-operatively a non-anatomical resection and transplantation of segments II and III was performed successfully. The boy is growing normally two years after the transplantation."
