  "text": "A patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura had a previous history of interrupted pregnancy due to severe thrombocytopenia, and was unresponsive to high doses of corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. Immediately following pregnancy, our patient had a marked elevation in plasma levels of fibrinogen degradation products, D-dimer, and platelet factor 4, with a decrease in platelets, suggesting platelet activation and thrombogenesis. Combined treatment with an anticoagulant agent could prevent exacerbation of thrombocytopenia throughout pregnancy. Although the underlying causes leading to the series in her pregnancy course were uncertain, there were notable serological abnormalities, such as weakly positive antinuclear antibody and anti-U1-RNP antibody."
