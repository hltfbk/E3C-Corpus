  "text": "A healthy young woman presented with initially unilateral sciatic nerve palsy, which manifested and worsened during the early phases of two successive pregnancies. Electrophysiology revealed axonal lesion of the sciatic nerve with predominant affection of the peroneal part. Extensive laboratory examination including cerebrospinal fluid examination was unremarkable. MR imaging was compatible with bilateral intraneural perineurioma. Recurrent occurrence during two pregnancies and an anamnestic relationship between intermediate worsening of the paresis and the menstrual cycle suggested hormone-dependency of the tumor. However, response to repeated intravenous immunoglobuline (IVIG) therapy during pregnancy and shortly after childbirth resulted in partial reversion of foot drop. This was also indicative of an immunoneuropathy. Nerve biopsy was not performed because of clinical improvement. The precise underlying neuropathological mechanism remained unclear."
