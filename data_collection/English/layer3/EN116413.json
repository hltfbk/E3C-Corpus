  "text": "An 18-year-old woman with lower extremity muscle weakness was admitted due to decreased vision of both eyes for two weeks. Ophthalmic examination revealed violaceous eruption on eyelids with swelling. Ocular fundus examination revealed multiple cotton wool spots and Purtscher flecken, and intra-retinal haemorrhages with pseudo-cherry red spot. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase was measured and found to be increased. A diagnosis of Purtscher-like retinopathy associated with dermatomyositis was made and the patient was treated with corticosteroids."
