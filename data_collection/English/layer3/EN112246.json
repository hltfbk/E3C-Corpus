  "text": "A 50-year-old man with a history of mood disorder and progressive cognitive decline for 20 years as well as well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension presented with recurrent generalized seizures and acute right-sided weakness. An MRI of the brain showed acute infarction of the left pons, a large number of cerebral microbleeds throughout the brain and white matter abnormalities without classic anterior temporal lobe lesions. Molecular genetic testing identified a homozygous pathologic variant, c.1672C > T (p. Arg558Cys), in the NOTCH3 gene. The diagnosis of CADASIL was confirmed. His clinical symptoms deteriorated, and he died of tracheobronchitis with secretion obstruction."
