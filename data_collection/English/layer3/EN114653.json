  "text": "21 years male student presented with anterior midline painless progressive swelling over right knee joint of one year duration which was hard, non-tender, fixed to patella but mobile with patella. X ray showed midline heterogeneously radio-opaque swelling attached to inferolateral aspect of the anterior surface of patella. Patellar out line is fully maintained except the narrow site of tumour attachment. After exposing through midline incision, the swelling was found to incorporate the patellar tendon completely and an anterior vertical midline cleavage was found. The mass was deliberately detached along the cleavage and from intact patellar tendon. Almost full range of knee movement is obtained in operation table. Immediate post operative 10Â° quadriceps lag was corrected with quadriceps setting exercises in two weeks time. Histopathological examination demonstrated thin layer of cartilage cover, irregular lamellar bone in deeper zone and spindle cells between them without cytoplasmic atypia. Plenty of cartilage cells in different stages of maturation are seen without column formation. Marrow elements are absent. Periosteum could not be demonstrated and there was no other evidence of malignancy. Features simulate 'bizarre parosteal osteochondromatous proliferation'. There is no recurrence in five years of follow up."
