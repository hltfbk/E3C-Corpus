  "text": "The authors studied the case of a 24-year-old caucasian pregnant woman, with a past medical history of acute pancreatitis, combined dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus. At 7 weeks of pregnancy she was referred to the outpatient endocrinology and obstetrics clinic for diabetes care. A physical examination revealed that she presented a loss of fat from the extremities and trunk and also had an excess of subcutaneous fat in the chin. Triglyceride levels were persistently high, and glycaemic control was only achieved through the administration of high doses of insulin (1.8 U/Kg/day). Dunnigan lipodystrophy was suspected and thus a genetic study was requested, which revealed the presence of c.1444C > T (p.Arg482Trp) heterozygote mutation in the lamin A/C gene."
