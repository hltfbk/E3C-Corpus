  "text": "The patient was brought to hospital by family reporting a one week history of sudden deterioration, cognitive decline, and lethargy. The patient presented with reduced arousal, cognitive function (Glasgow Coma Scale: 10, Abbreviated Mental Test Score:CS, 0 AMTS), and no history of trauma. Computed Tomography (CT) imaging was ordered and identified a significant pneumocephalus with no cranial defect. Further investigations acknowledged possible sinus or middle ear disease, which was highlighted by the discovery of S. salivarius by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and potentially exacerbated by the use of nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The patient made a complete recovery by eliminating likely causative factors and long term regimental antibiotics administration."
