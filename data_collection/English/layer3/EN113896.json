  "text": "We evaluated slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography in a 66Â years old man suffering visual loss. Fundoscopy showed serous neuroretinal detachment of the fovea accompanied with white spots surrounding the fovea in both eyes. Although therapy with Trametinib and Dabrafenib was stopped uveitis anterior was seen 2 weeks later. After a year, the therapy was started again and the serous neuroretinal detachment appeared once more, however without inflammatory reaction of the anterior chamber."
