  "text": "A 30-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of lower urinary tract reconstruction with an ileal pouch and a continent umbilical stoma was admitted to our department with pouch urolithiasis in the urinary reservoir. We employed a minimally invasive approach to extract the stone using flexible ureteroscopy via a modified access sheath and laser lithotripsy. No analgesia is needed with this procedure and it can be performed in an out-patient setting."
