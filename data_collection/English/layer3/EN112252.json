  "text": "A 72-year-old gentleman presented with postural hypotension, hallucination, Parkinsonism and recurrent falls. He also had rapidly progressing cognitive impairment. CT and MRI brain showed atrophy of the frontal lobes with preservation of the hippocampi. FDG-PET was suggestive of DLB. He was subsequently treated with Rivastigmine, with significant improvement of his symptoms."
