  "text": "A 25-year-old female presented to the emergency department with acute worsening of abdominal pain that began four weeks earlier. She was found to have peritonitis, leukocytosis, severe lactic acidosis, and a pronounced anemia and imaging was consistent with nontraumatic renal rupture with retroperitoneal abscess, perforation of the colon, and severe necrotizing fasciitis of the right lower limb. She underwent a right nephrectomy, a right hemicolectomy, surgical debridement of the retroperitoneum, and an upper thigh amputation. Due to severe septic shock and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure we performed a combined treatment of hemoadsorption using a Cytosorb hemoadsorber and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD). Subsequently the patient recovered and was discharged home with no signs of infections and with normal renal function."
