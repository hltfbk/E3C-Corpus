  "text": "One 57-year-old female patient and one 69-year-old male patient presented with pancreatic lesions incidentally detected by US; CT and MRI revealed a 2.9-cm cystic and solid lesion and a 1.4-cm solid lesion, respectively. US showed a hypoechoic well-defined mass in the pancreatic head. The plain CT indicated that the internal density was uneven, and the lesions showed obvious progressive enhancement. The MRI-T2WI showed iso- to high-intensity, the DWI showed iso-intensity, and the masses also all showed obvious progressive enhancement. Histopathological studies confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatic hamartoma."
