  "text": "A 59-year-old woman was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and local radiation after surgery for left breast cancer. She presented with a rapidly growing mass in the right breast at 20 months after surgery. Mammography and computed tomography revealed a massive tumour. She was diagnosed with primary breast lymphoma by aspiration cytology, and surgery was performed. Histopathological and immunohistochemical findings confirmed a diffuse large B-cell type primary breast lymphoma."
