  "text": "A 47-year-old female presented with an 8-year complaint of difficulty falling asleep and waking up in the morning. The patient was diagnosed with major depressive disorder at the age of 35 years and was treated with various antidepressants since that time. At the age of 40 years, the patient's sleep-wake cycle began to extend without exacerbation of depressive symptoms. The patient was diagnosed with N24SWD at the age of 43 years. Ramelteon 8 mg/d and then melatonin 1 mg/d were administered, but these did not provide effective treatment. In January 2016, after treatment with aripiprazole 3 mg/d in the morning for 4 weeks, the patient's sleep-wake cycle became markedly synchronized to the environmental light-dark cycle. Her sleep-wake cycle remained synchronized when the same dose of aripiprazole was administered for at least 6 months."
