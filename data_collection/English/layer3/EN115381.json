  "text": "The samples were collected from a 57 year-old Hong Kong gentleman who diagnosed to have undifferentiated type of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. He was treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and then received a second-course radiotherapy with IMRT. 18S rDNA sequencing revealed that the isolates belong to Exophiala dermatitidis which was susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole. Interestingly, E. dermatitidis isolates were resistant to caspofungin and one isolate was resistant to amphotericin B. Both isolates formed biofilms comparable to that of Candida albicans. Single isolate of E. dermatitidis showed hemolysin and proteinase ability comparable to C. albicans whilst the other isolate was not."
