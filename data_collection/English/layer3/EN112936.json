  "text": "A 76-year-old woman presented with right breast cancer (T1N0M0, stage I) 9 years ago. She had undergone breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy and was receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy for the malignancy. Six years after presenting with the tumor, she developed pigmented skin and was diagnosed with a RAAS; this angiosarcoma recurred three times within 2 years. The angiosarcoma was resected each of the three times, after which adjuvant radiation therapy was performed. At 76 years old, the patient developed a new mass on her chest skin in the vicinity of the scar. Angiosarcoma was diagnosed following a pathology report, which resulted in a second diagnosis of recurrent RAAS again since the diagnostic criteria were met. After extensive resection of the irradiated area, the patient has remained free of angiosarcoma for the last 3 years."
