  "text": "A 73-year-old man with stage IV malignant melanoma underwent nivolumab therapy. The patient presented to our hospital because of a progressing abdominal pain. Radiological evaluation revealed evidence of free intraperitoneal air. Therefore, we diagnosed the patient as having an intestinal perforation, which was successfully resolved after surgical treatment."
