  "text": "A 65-year-old woman was admitted with right hypochondrial pain and high fever. A diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis was made by radiological imaging. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed that the confluence of the right and left hepatic duct was unclear. Intraoperatively, the procedure was converted from a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to laparotomy because of unclear anatomy of the cystic duct with severe inflammation at Calot's triangle. Furthermore, intraoperative cholangiography from Hartmann's pouch showed the main right hepatic duct entering the cystic duct. Subtotal cholecystectomy was performed to avoid injuring the right hepatic duct."
