  "text": "This is a 37-year-old Bangladeshi man who sustained a comminuted calcaneal fracture and a Lisfranc fracture of the left foot. Initial radiograph showed a joint depression-type fracture, excluding a surgical emergency. Nevertheless, the patient developed skin necrosis over the posterior aspect of the heal that improved after open reduction and internal fixation of the calcaneus. Pre-operative computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a bony fragment that was displaced posteriorly causing the skin necrosis."
