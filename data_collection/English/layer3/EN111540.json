  "text": "We admitted a case of a 64-year-old man with type 1 neurofibromatosis, GISTs, and ascending colon cancer. This case was characterized by caf√©-au-lait macules, discrete cutaneous neurofibromas, nodular neurofibromas, multiple jejunal tumours, and ascending colon cancer. Laparoscopic exploration revealed ascending colon cancer and multiple jejunal tumours. Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy and local excision of the jejunal tumours were performed successfully. The pathological results confirmed moderate differentiated adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon with multiple jejunal GISTs (low risk, very low risk). Moreover, the immunohistochemistry results of multiple jejunal GISTs suggest that NF1 is positive. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) of colon cancer revealed mutations in more than 20 genes, including KRAS, PIK3CA, APC, SMAD4, etc. The results of whole-exome sequencing (WES) of jejunal GISTs revealed an NF1 mutation and no KIT or PDGFR gene mutation."
