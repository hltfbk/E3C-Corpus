  "text": "A 29-year-old man with presumed acute KD history at the age of 5 suddenly lost consciousness while jogging and was diagnosed a sudden cardiac arrest by an emergency doctor. After about 10 min cardiopulmonary resuscitation, return of spontaneous circulation was achieved, and the patient was transferred to our hospital. A coronary computed tomography angiogram and coronary angiography revealed extensive calcifications of left anterior descending and right coronary artery aneurysms. The patient was an active individual who took exercise regularly and claimed no previous symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath on exertion. The most possible cause of his sudden cardiac arrest could be presumed as a thrombus within the coronary artery aneurysms. After that, a thromboembolism induced extensive ischemia, and this ischemia-induced arrhythmia led to a cardiac arrest."
