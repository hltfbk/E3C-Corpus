  "text": "We describe a case of a maternal diaphragmatic hernia diagnosed at 31Â weeks gestation in the setting of acute upper abdominal pain. Due to no evidence of visceral compromise and a stable maternal condition, the patient was conservatively managed, allowing for further foetal maturation. Delivery by caesarean section occurred following concerns of malnutrition and partial bowel obstruction. This was followed by immediate surgical repair of the hernia. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery."
