  "text": "A 17-year-old female presented to our outpatient clinic complaining of a sensation of a lump in her throat. Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination identified a swelling of the base of the tongue in the glossoepiglottic area. Thyroid scintigraphy showed a single contrast enhancement in the sublingual region, instead of in the normal anatomical position of the thyroid. She was treated surgically after failed hormone-suppressing therapy. An arteriography performed before the surgery showed vascular anomalies and was useful in surgical planning."
