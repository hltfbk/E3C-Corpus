  "text": "In this article, we report a patient with nephrotic syndrome as the only initial manifestation. Membranous nephropathy was confirmed by renal biopsy, but without any renal interstitial lesions. The nephrotic syndrome completely resolved after treatment with immunosuppressants but recurred after drug withdrawal, which was accompanied by acute kidney injury. Ultimately, IgG4-related interstitial nephritis with membranous nephropathy was confirmed by a second renal biopsy. After routine administration of steroids and cyclophosphamide, renal function returned to normal after 2 months, and nephrotic syndrome was ameliorated after 5 months."
