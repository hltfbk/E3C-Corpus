  "text": "A 62-year-old Asian man from China presented with a 13-year history of a right shoulder mass with recent ongoing pain. A desmoplastic fibroma located in the posterior muscles of the neck was suggested by magnetic resonance imaging, and extended local excision was performed. A biopsy, however, revealed large, isolated rhabdoid cells in a diffuse pattern with mild atypia and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Clustered lymphoid cells were interspersed among these cells. The diagnosis was initially suggested to be adult rhabdomyoma. The final diagnosis of lymphoma was made after immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and molecular studies."
