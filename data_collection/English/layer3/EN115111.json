  "text": "A 12-year-old Japanese girl with no history of systemic illness was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus and concomitant primary cytomegalovirus infection. Her anti-cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G antibodies were elevated during diagnosis and treatment. Further, the patient's cytomegalovirus pp65 antigenemia level was slightly elevated (1 cell per 5 Ã— 10(4) cells). Treatment included the administration of ganciclovir, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, and cyclophosphamide, none of which prompted adverse effects. The patient was in good condition at the most recent follow-up."
