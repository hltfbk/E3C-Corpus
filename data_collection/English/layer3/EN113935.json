  "text": "We encountered an 18-year-old Chinese woman who had mild dull pain on the left side of back. The following chest computed tomography (CT) showed a heterogeneous mass deeply situated in the posterior mediastinum with compression of the lung and invasion of the adjacent rib. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the tumor exhibited predominantly slight hyperintensity on T2-weighted images and intensely heterogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. The whole body bone scan showed a mildly increased radiotracer uptake in the proximal portion of the left fifth rib, suggestive of local infiltration by the tumor. Surgical resection of the tumor was performed; subsequently, the tumor was histopathologically proved as GCT-ST. Three months after the operation, the patient developed a local recurrence. A brief discussion about the radiological findings, histopathological features, clinical behavior, and a detailed review of the relevant literature are presented."
