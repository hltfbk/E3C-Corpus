  "text": "An 80-year-old Saudi male came with a history of simultaneous bilateral vision loss 5â€‰days prior to presentation. The exam showed dilated non-reactive pupils, no light perception in both eyes, and normal fundus exam. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels were high Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain showed a right posterior optic nerve lesion and absence of flow in both ophthalmic arteries respectively. A left temporal artery biopsy confirmed giant cell arteritis."
