  "text": "A 66-year-old woman presented with epistaxis and haemorrhage of the left ear without any obvious inducement for a period of one week. The patient has a 7 year history of hearing loss, mastoiditis, left tympanic membrane perforation and cervical necrotizing fasciitis which prompted a surgical debridement. A pseudoaneurysm was not observed during that time. The coagulation profile revealed that the haemoglobin level on admission was 60 g/L. An otoscopic examination revealed a blood-stained left external auditory canal. The tympanic membrane was intact. A laryngoscope examination revealed blood stained secretions in the posterior pharyngeal wall. Left pharyngeal oedema and a swollen uvula was observed. Neck contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a slightly high-density shadow visible in the left parapharyngeal space, pharyngeal space and internal carotid artery area measuring 2.9 cm x 3.7 cm. Oropharynx and laryngopharynx were compressed and narrowed. The patient underwent ICA coil occlusion. The angiogram was obtained to confirm the pseudoaneurysm and check the flow. With the help of a 5F catheter and a guide wire, the pseudoaneurysm was successfully embolized using coils. Postembolization angiography revealed a complete exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm. The patient was given a blood transfusion. Follow-up evaluations revealed no recurrent episodes."
