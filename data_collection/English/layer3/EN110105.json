  "text": "We report a case of multiple facial injuries of a 13 day old neonate who was well until 90mins prior to presentation when mother's attention was drawn to the patient by the older sibling who noticed she was crying. She noticed blood on the left side of the face of the child and on cleaning observed complete loss of the left upper and lower eyelids, partial loss of the nares and an ulcer on the left cheek. No eye witness account of the exact cause of the incident. About 30 minutes prior to the incident, she was breastfed, wrapped in a shawl and put in a zipped up net that was placed on a bed about 60cm from the floor. She was alone in the room after breastfeeding while her mother was attending to other domestic needs in the backyards. Patient is a second set of a preterm twin and the fourth children of the second wife in a polygamous family setting. Father is a primary school dropout and he is a lorry driver. Mother is a secondary school dropout and she is a sewing mistress by profession. The patient lives with her other siblings in a single room in a rented apartment which has no fence. Mother also reported free mobility and navigation of rats within and around the house before the incidence. No similar incidence in the other siblings. Patient is a second set of a preterm twin and the last of the four children of the second wife in a polygamous family setting. Father is a primary school dropout and he is a lorry driver. Mother is a secondary school dropout and she is a sewing mistress by profession. The patient lives with her other siblings in a single room in a rented apartment which has no fence. Mother also reported free mobility and navigation of rats within and around the house before the incidence. No similar incidence in the other siblings. Examination revealed an acutely ill looking child with complete loss of the left upper and lower eyelids, partial loss of both nares, 2 by 3cm ulcer on the left cheek and left central corneal ulcer. Her weight was1kg, occipitofrontal circumference was, left arm circumference was 37cm and cranial caudal length was 22cm. She was neither pale nor febrile. The right eye with and the adnexae were intact. Systemic examinations were not contributory. She was admitted into special baby care unit (SCBU) of the hospital and was reviewed by the pediatrician who recommended that she should be in the incubator, and was given subcutaneous ante tetanus toxoid 750 IU stat after negative test dose, intramuscular TT 0.5ml stat, intravenous (IV) Unasyn 150mg/kg/dy in 3 divided doses, IV Gentamicin 5mg/kg/day. She was also fed with EBM at 120kcal/kg/day. The wound was cleaned daily with normal saline after review by the plastic surgeon. Generous chloramphenicol ointment was applied over the ocular injury while the globe was protected by Catellar shield during her sleep and at night. She was also commenced on artifial eye tear hourly. Two weeks after the injury she was noticed to have developed left central microbial keratitis. Examination at this time revealed a deeply stained central corneal ulcer with circum-corneal injection. The care giver was offered a referral to a corneal specialist at an outside facility but they declined due to financial constraint. Patient was to have corneal scrapings done for microscopic, culture and sensitivity but the care giver could also not afford it. She was commenced on hourly Lomefloxacillin (3%) eye drop which was procured through voluntary donations from the physicians. The corneal ulcer and infiltrates have resolved and the care giver has been informed of the need for penetrating keratoplasty and lid reconstruction as soon as possible. The child is currently doing well under routine follow-up at ophthalmology, pediatrics and plastic surgery departments."
