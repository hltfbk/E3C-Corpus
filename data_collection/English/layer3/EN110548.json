  "text": "A 24-year-old primigravida woman was referred to the emergency department at 35 weeks of gestation with a complaint of sudden abdominal pain. Perinatal examination was unremarkable. The patient had no history of abdominal surgeries, trauma or pelvic inflammatory diseases. The uterus was nearly term sized, and the fetal heart sounded normal. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with decreased bowel sounds. Additionally, the abdomen was tympanic to percussion with right upper quadrant tenderness. Vaginal examination revealed a closed cervical opening. The patient's blood pressure was 130/90mmHg, the pulse rate was 84/min, and the body temperature was 37.3Â°C.\nFetal ultrasound (USG) showed no abnormalities in the fetus or the placenta. Biometric measurements were compatible with 35 gestational weeks, and the estimated body weight was 2.5 kg. A nonstress test showed reactive patterns, and no uterine contraction was observed. Plain abdominal X-ray showed mechanical obstruction of the small intestine. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multiple loops of dilated small intestine of the distal jejunum. The point of transition was identified in the distal jejunum. T2-weighted images identified dilated loops of jejunum, and extraluminal compression of the bowel caused by a visible adhesive band.\nThe patient's symptoms did not improve after over an hour of observation, and the well-being of the fetus could not be guaranteed. The decision was made to proceed with a Cesarean delivery and to explore the abdomen to determine the cause of the small bowel obstruction. Cesarean section began with a lower midline laparotomy incision. A 2,680-gram male baby with a 7/9 Apgar score was delivered. Following repair of the uterine incision, abdominal exploration was performed. One adhesive band was identified in the distal jejunum. Occlusion due to these bands resulted from the trapping of the intestines between the band and mesentery. A fibrotic band between the jejunal mesentery and the distal jejunum caused the small bowel obstruction. The constricted portion of the bowel appeared dark and congested initially. Meticulous adhesiolysis was performed to free the bowel loops. After release of the adhesive band, the bowel regained its color and was viable. Mesenteric artery pulsations were palpable, and bowel peristalsis was also observed. The patient was discharged 7 days postoperatively. After 1 week in the neonatal intensive care unit, the male baby (now 2,700 grams) returned home with the mother. No adverse event developed in the mother or baby during a 1-year period."
