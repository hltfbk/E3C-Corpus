  "text": "We report a case of spontaneous idiopathic omental haemorrhage with no evidence of trauma, neoplasm or presence of anticoagulation. This was identified on the imaging studies performed for the purpose of diagnosis of the cause of the patient's right iliac fossa pain. The patient required urgent laparotomy and omentectomy to achieve haemostasis."
