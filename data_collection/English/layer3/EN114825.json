  "text": "We report a case of SLOS at the mild end of the clinical spectrum, presenting with bilateral pelvis ectasia, mild dysmorphic features and mild intellectual disability. The case is compound heterozygous for a known pathogenic mutation (c.724C > T, p.Arg242Cys) and a mutation that has only been reported once in a Portuguese patient (c.521 T > C, p.Phe174Ser) whose pathogenicity has not been yet assessed. We compared the two patients carrying the p.Phe174Ser variant and concluded that this variant is associated with mild forms of SLOS."
