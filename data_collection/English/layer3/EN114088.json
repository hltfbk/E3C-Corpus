  "text": "The patient was an 81-year-old man. Following cataract surgery on his left eye, his decimal best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was markedly reduced from 0.2 to 0.02. A large number of asteroid bodies (ABs) was observed to be concentrated on the posterior surface of the implanted intraocular lens. Ultrasound B-mode images showed turbidity of the vitreous that was denser in the anterior vitreous where the ABs were concentrated. During vitrectomy, the ABs were observed to be concentrated in the anterior vitreous cavity, and a complete posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) was present. After vitrectomy successfully removed the ABs, the visibility of the fundus improved and the BCVA recovered to 1.0."
