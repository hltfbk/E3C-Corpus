  "text": "A 13-year-old athlete presented to our orthopedic department because of persistent pain after an acute ankle injury 2months before. She was diagnosed with a Tillaux fracture that eventually progressed to nonunion after conservative treatment. Surgery was performed to treat the nonunion, and the fracture fragment was fixed using a soft suture anchor."
