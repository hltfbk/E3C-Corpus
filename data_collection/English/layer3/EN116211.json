  "text": "A six year old girl presented with fixed flexion deformity of interphalangeal joints of both thumbs and Notta's nodules. It is diagnosed as trigger thumb and release of bilateral A1pulleys is done. But we found another constricting annular pulley just distal to A1. Only after splitting the distal pulley, we could get complete extension of interphalangeal joints. At two years follow-up, the child is free of complications."
