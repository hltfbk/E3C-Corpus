  "text": "A 62-year-old Chinese woman presented to the First Hospital of Jilin University with abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody stool. Preoperative computed tomography imaging indicated intussusception. The intraoperative diagnosis was consistent with postoperative pathology. Our patient was diagnosed as having an inverted colonic diverticulum near the ileocecal valve with intussusception and intestinal necrosis."
