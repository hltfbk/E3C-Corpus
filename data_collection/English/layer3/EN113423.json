  "text": "A 62-year-old female, without any systemic disease, trauma, or history of surgery, presented with a unique case of a large intramuscular chondrolipoma ofthe scapula. This protruding lump over the right shoulder was present for 3 months in the patient without pain or limited range of motion. A sonographic evaluation revealed a homogeneous hypoechoic lesion in the posterior right shoulder. MRI showed that the chondrolipoma measured 7.5 x 4.6 x 3.9 cm, without remarkable bony invasion, with high signal intensity over the mass in T1- weighted images, indicating cystic changes, and mild signal enhancement within the cyst in T2-weighted images. Surgical marginal excision was performed. We identified yellowish, greasy, and firm soft tissue and two cartilaginous nodules inside the lipomatous tissue. Pathological findings revealed mature adipose tissue with a fibrous capsule and true cartilage inside. Post-operative outpatient follow-up found no recurrence after 2 years."
