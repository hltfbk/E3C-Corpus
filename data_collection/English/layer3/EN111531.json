  "text": "A 64-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presented for allogeneic HSCT and passed away from intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to mucormycosis infection 13 days following her transplant. On autopsy, it was found she had angioinvasive mucormycosis in her frontal lobe leading to cerebral edema which eventually led to tonsillar herniation and brainstem infarction. Her lungs were the likely source of infectious dissemination."
