  "text": "A30-year-old man came to emergency department after falling on the outstretched palm. After first physical examination and radiologic searches, elbow joint posterolateral dislocation was diagnosed. Together with sedoanalgesia, elbow dislocation was reduced, and instability evaluation by applying varus and valgus stress tests was performed. Positive valgus stress test and palpation sign which indicated soft tissue damage on the medial side of elbow were determined. Control roentgenograms showed no osseous pathology. By magnetic resonance imaging, elbow dislocation diagnosis accompanying MCLR and FGOR without fracture was confirmed. Using medial approach, ruptured MCL and elbow FGO repairing procedures were performed."
