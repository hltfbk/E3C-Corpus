  "text": "A 64-year-old Chinese woman with high myopia was diagnosed as having a macular hole-related retinal detachment with vitreo-retinal traction in her right eye by optical coherence tomography. Thirty-three months later, the macular hole closed, with formation of a lamellar hole and decreased retinal detachment. Twelve months later, retinal reattachment was found to have occurred, accompanied by the development of macular retinoschisis. Fifty-four months after initial examination, the retina remained attached with a lamellar hole and retinoschisis in the macular area. The vitreo-retinal traction persisted during the follow-up period."
