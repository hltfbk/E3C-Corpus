  "text": "A 48-year-old Japanese man with a slow-growing desmoid tumor on his chest wall was treated with an oral administration of tranilast (300 mg per day, three times a day). Two years and two months after the commencement of his therapy, the tumor became impalpable. At this time, the oral administration of tranilast was discontinued. Two years after discontinuation of the treatment, a physical examination showed no recurrence of the tumor and he continued in a state of remission. We were successfully able to reduce the size of the tumor and thereafter maintain the reduced size."
