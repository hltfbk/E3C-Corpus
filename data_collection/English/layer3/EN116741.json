  "text": "We report a case of a 56-year-old Chinese woman who presented with bilateral asymmetric visual loss secondary to optic neuritis. She was subsequently found to be seropositive for neuromyelitis optica immunoglobulin G (NMO-IgG) (anti-aquaporin-4 antibody) and was diagnosed with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. She also fulfilled the international criteria for Sj√∂gren's syndrome. Despite initial high dose immunosuppressive therapy, she failed to regain vision in one eye."
