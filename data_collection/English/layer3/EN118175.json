  "text": "We report a 51-year-old Iranian woman who presented with back pain and paraparesis. MR imaging study of her spine showed an enhancing cystic lesion at the level of conus medullaris. Despite detailed investigation, no specific aetiology was found till a bone scan obtained to evaluate an agonizing pain on the dorsum of the left hand revealed photon deficient area within the left kidney in addition to oseoblastic bony lesions. After thorough imaging investigation she underwent radical nephrectomy which confirmed renal cell carcinoma."
