  "text": "A 72-year-old Caucasian (white) man diagnosed with monoclonal immunoglobin M kappa lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia monitored without treatment for 2 years, presented with dyspnea and a left pleural effusion. At presentation, computed tomography scans of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed layering left pleural effusion and para-aortic lymphadenopathy. Pleural fluid cytology demonstrated B-cell lymphoma of the lymphoplasmacytic subtype, with monoclonal kappa B-cell population on flow and a positive MYD88 L265P mutation. The pleural effusion recurred post-thoracentesis and he achieved a lasting complete remission as defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline with 240â€‰mg ibrutinib."
