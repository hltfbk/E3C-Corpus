  "text": "The authors present a case of a 59-year-old Caucasian man with a primary gastric adenocarcinoma that had been surgically removed 10 years before he developed bladder metastasis. He presented with low abdominal pain after 10 years without any symptoms. Cystoscopy and an abdominal computed tomography scan showed a bladder tumor. A transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed. A histological examination revealed an adenocarcinoma, which turned out to be a metastasis of the primary gastric tumor. One year later, abdominal surgery revealed peritoneal metastases."
