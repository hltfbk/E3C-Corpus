  "text": "The patient was a 43-year-old woman with maxillary molar vertical crown-root fracture. She underwent flapless immediate implant placement into the fresh molar socket with PRF. At the follow-up visit 15 d post procedure, the vascularization of soft tissue was visible. There was no swelling or pain after the surgery. Six months postoperatively, the regeneration of bone and soft tissues was visible. Subsequently, the definitive restoration was placed. The patient was satisfied with the aesthetic outcomes."
