  "text": "The proband was a 4-year-old boy. He accidentally fell, following which luxation of the bulbus oculi occurred immediately. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging clearly revealed ocular proptosis. Upon physical examination, the proband, his father, and grandfather had ocular proptosis, shallow orbits, and mid-face hypoplasia. However, their hands and feet were clinically normal. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood through a polymerase chain reaction performed for the target sequence. Genetic assessments revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (c.1012G > C, p.G338R) in exon 10 of the human FGFR2, cosegregated with the disease phenotype in this family. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of CS."
