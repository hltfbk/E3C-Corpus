  "text": "A 70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of hepatic disorder. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed irregular thickening of the wall within the gallbladder fundus. Because the lesion might have been malignant, we performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy and liver bed resection. Macroscopic findings showed the mucosal surface of the tumor was smooth, and its form was similar to that of a submucosal tumor. Histopathological examination revealed papillary tumors within the mass with low-grade dysplasia; therefore, we diagnosed ICPN."
