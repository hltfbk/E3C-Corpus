  "text": "In these cases, series, we reported four cases of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma in children and one case in an elderly patient. The diagnosis was made by history taking, physical examination and Cerebral MSCT Angiography, as well as Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA). After identification of the Feeding artery, we performed transarterial embolisation using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foam particles."
