  "text": "We present a case report of a 10-year-old girl of Chinese Han ethnicity who presented with renal Fanconi syndrome, infantile hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, and transient cholestasis. In addition, she presented with bilateral severe hearing loss. Gene analysis showed a heterozygous p.R63W mutation in the HNF4A gene that is responsible for Fanconi syndrome and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia."
