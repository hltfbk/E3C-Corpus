  "text": "A 39-year-old female visited our hospital complaining of intermittent abdominal pain for the previous 3 months. CT revealed a 3.4 cm slight homogeneous enhancement in the lesser curvature of the stomach; the mass was nodular soft tissue, which was removed by radical surgery. Two solid tumors with different volumes were located in the stomach. Histologically and immunohistochemically different, the larger tumor consisted of spindle cells surrounded by a peripheral lymphoid cuff, and was positive for S-100. The larger tumor was therefore classified as a gastric schwannoma. The smaller tumor was composed of medium-sized round, oval cells with amphiphilic granular cytoplasm; vacuolization was also observed. The tumor cells were positive for DOG1 and sporadically positive for CD34 and CD117. Hence, the smaller tumor was diagnosed as epithelioid GISTs. Sanger sequencing revealed that the GIST tumor cells contained a deletion mutation (c.2527_2538 del12,843-846del4), which was located in exon 18 of PDGFRA."
