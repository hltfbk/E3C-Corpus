  "text": "We present the case of a 53-year-old woman with long-standing immune thrombocytopenia who underwent repair of a symptomatic ventral hernia. On post-operative day one the patient developed hemoperitoneum, requiring exploratory laparotomy and massive transfusion of blood products. The patient's recovery was complicated by consistently low hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelets, prompting frequent transfusion of additional blood products. Shortly after activation of the massive transfusion protocol, the patient developed TRALI. Compounding the situation, on post-operative day sixteen the patient's serum started to show hemolysis: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels rose to 1,845 IU/L, with haptoglobin at less than 5.8 mg/dL and with a high reticulocyte count (4.38%). Previous testing had shown that the patient was positive for most major antigens implicated in antibody formation and was only producing anti-E and anti-K antibodies (considered for all transfusions). Initial pre- and post-transfusion direct antiglobulin tests (DAT) were indeed negative. However, repeat DATs in the days following the noted serum changes were consistent with new allo-antibody formation. These findings prompted immediate withholding of all blood products and a thorough blood bank work up. Despite strong evidence for new allo-antibody formation, no specific known antibody could be identified. The patient recover well when blood products were withheld."
