  "text": "We present the case of a 23-year-old female patient suffering, since the age of 14 years, from a fluctuating paranoid-hallucinatory syndrome with formal thought disorder, fear, delusions of persecution, auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations, as well as negative and cognitive symptoms. Laboratory measurements showed increased titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) in the context of ulcerative colitis. While there was no clear history or evidence of epileptic seizures, the EEG showed generalized 3 Hz polyspike wave complexes. Under treatment with levetiracetam, the symptoms disappeared and the patient was able to complete vocational training."
