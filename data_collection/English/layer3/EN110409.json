  "text": "A 42-year-old man consulted the neurosurgery department complaining of slight back pain and right drop-foot. His physical examination showed paresis of the tibialis anterior, lateral peroneal and extensor digitorum muscles with a muscle strength grade 2. Diagnosis was thought as a lumbar disc herniation and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was carried out. It showed bulging of L4-L5 and L5-S1 and no disc extrusion. Electromyographic investigation showed that the common peroneal nerve was affected at the knee level. The patient was referred to our orthopedic department. He had neither knee pain nor history of trauma to his knee. Physical examination of right knee showed no abnormality other than tenderness around the fibular head. He had no palpable mass. The radiography was normal. MRI of the knee revealed a 48×20×12mm soft tissue mass with clear borders localized at the anterior of proximal tibiofibular joint with poor visualization of the common peroneal nerve. Intraoperatively, the cystic mass had infiltrated the common fibular nerve with dissociation of its fibers and without any real visualization of pedicle with the proximal tibiofibular joint. Resection was minitious to avoid nerve injury. Histopathological investigation had revealed as a synovial cyst. Unfortunately the cyst recidivated four months later with reappearance of a larger mass of about 5cm at the same localization. Surgical resection removed the entire cyst and the pedicle was found and cut, the nerve appears continuous but its fibers are dissociated. Neurological status of the patient at 18 months after the second operation showed a slight improvement despite continued rehabilitation. We found no recurrence of the synovial cyst on MRI at the last 18-month follow-up. The second case is about a 29-year-old woman who was admitted to the orthopedic department complaining of swelling and pain at her left knee and total loss of ankle active dorsiflexion. She had symptoms for 2 months and no history of trauma. Physical examination of the knee showed slight swelling at the fibular head but no palpable mass. In neurological examination, all motor functions of common peroneal nerve were lost. MRI showed an 85×24×10mm multi-compartmental cystic formation at the anterolateral side of fibular head and communicating at its superior pole with the proximal tibiofibular joint by a thin 2mm pedicle. Intraoperatively, cystic mass that adhered to and compressed the common peroneal nerve was totally excised and the pedicle was found and cut. Anatomopathology confirmed the synovial type of the cyst. Peroneal nerve palsy was completely improved 12 months after operation. No recurrence was seen at 2 years of follow-up."
