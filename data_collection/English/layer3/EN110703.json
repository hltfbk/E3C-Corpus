  "text": "When this male patient was 55â€‰years old, he underwent laparoscopy-assisted anus-preserving total proctocolectomy, the creation of a J-type ileal pouch, ileal pouch-anal canal anastomosis (IPAA), and creation of ileostomy for intractable UC. Three months later, ileostomy closure was performed. The first onset of SBO was observed 5 months after ileostomy closure. SBO occurred repeatedly, and the patient was hospitalized nine times in approximately 2 years. Each SBO was improved by non-surgical treatment. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the afferent limb was narrowing and twisted, and gastrografin enema confirmed narrowing at the proximal portion of the pouch inlet. Endoscopy showed a sharp angulation at the pouch inlet. We suspected ALS and decided on a surgical policy and performed pouchopexy and ileopexy to the retroperitoneum by suturing with excision of the remaining blind end of the ileum. Endoscopy 3 days after surgery showed neither twist nor stricture in the fixed ileal pouch or the afferent limb. At the time of writing, the patient remains free of SBO symptoms."
