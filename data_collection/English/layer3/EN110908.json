  "text": "A 69-year-old man with history of retinal detachment treated with vitrectomy and subsequent cataract surgery presented with traumatic corneal laceration while cutting grass. Appropriate repair of corneal laceration and intravitreal antibiotics (vancomycin, ceftazidime) injection was performed. S. dysgalactiae which was sensitive to the conventional antibiotics (Ampicillin, Ceftriaxone, Levofloxacin, etc.) detected by aqueous culture. One day following primary closure, the patient developed a complete hypopyon and vitreous membranes. Despite vigorous systemic and intravitreal antibiotics administration with vitrectomy, endophthalmitis was not controlled and patient's ocular pain was increased. The vitreous culture was also positive for S. dysgalactiae. Finally, total enucleation was performed 9â€‰days after trauma due to fulminant endophthalmitis with severe scleritis."
