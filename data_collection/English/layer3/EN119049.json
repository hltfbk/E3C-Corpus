  "text": "An otherwise healthy 4 year-old female developed chronic pancreatitis and was diagnosed with pancreas divisum. Sphincterotomy was performed without resolution of her pancreatitis. Sweat test was negative for cystic fibrosis, but measurement of nasal potential differences suggested possible cystic fibrosis. These results prompted extended Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator Conductance (CFTR) mutational analysis that revealed a compound heterozygous mutation: DeltaF508 and L997F."
