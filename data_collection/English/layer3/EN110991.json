  "text": "We present two cases of thoracic aortic graft infections that had undergone surgical graft replacement for acute Stanford type A dissection. Their clinical manifestation of infection was atypical, with computed tomography suggesting infection of the grafts. Both patients were successfully treated with debridement, laparoscopic omental transposition, and antibiotics. The first case, a 55-year-old male, was found to have an infection at the aortic arch. The second case is a 52-year-old male who was found to have infection at the ascending aorta and arch. Surprisingly, both intraoperative cultures were negative. The infections were brought under control and the patients recovered steadily after surgery. Early follow-up results showed no signs of graft infection."
