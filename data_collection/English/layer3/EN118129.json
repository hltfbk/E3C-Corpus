  "text": "The case of a 74-year old caucasian male, complaining of slight dyspeptic symptoms (post-prandial fullness and bloating) is referred. The routine blood tests were all normal. Abdominal ultrasound showed a large, roughly round-shaped lesion (diameter 14 cm) in the VIII hepatic segment diagnosed as hepatic angiocavernoma, which turned unexpectedly in a cystic like lesion one year later."
