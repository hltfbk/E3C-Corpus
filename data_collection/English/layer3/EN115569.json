  "text": "Here we describe a case of an 11-year-old Tunisian boy who was referred for syncope. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large mobile mass attached to his right ventricle, obstructing his right ventricular outflow tract. Complete surgical excision of the mass with preservation of the pulmonary valve was performed. The diagnosis of myxoma was histologically confirmed."
