  "text": "A 74-year-old male presented with sudden onset of ocular pain, upper eye lid swelling, proptosis and diplopia after a commercial flight. After complete ophthalmic ocular examination including pupillary light reflexes and laboratory examinations; computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of orbit revealed a subperiostal mass-like lesion in the right retrobulbar-extraconal region which was compatible with intraorbital haematoma. Visual acuity was not compromised so we planned a conservative approach with close observation. We administered systemic corticosteroid and topical dorzolamide/timolol combination therapy. At the first month follow-up, intraorbital haematoma resolved without significant sequelae."
