  "text": "A 24-year-old man who wanted to donate a kidney to his 28-year-old brother with end-stage renal disease of unknown cause was evaluated. The 24-year-old man underwent percutaneous renal biopsy because of an accidentally found proteinuria. Electron microscopy of his renal biopsy showed numerous electron-dense multi-lamellar inclusions in the epithelial cytoplasm, typical for Fabry disease. Clinical and laboratory evaluation including the assessment of GLA enzyme activity and direct DNA sequencing in four members of the family were performed. Renal biopsy findings in the two affected male patients were described. Re-evaluation of a renal biopsy specimen of his 28-year-old brother obtained when he was diagnosed with renal failure revealed a very focal area of suspicious multilamellated structures in the Bowman's space. DNA sequencing on the young man, his brother, and his mother revealed a novel GLA gene mutation, c.263A > G (p.Tyr88Cys). The three all showed decreased α-galactosidase A activity."
