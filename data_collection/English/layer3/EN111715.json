  "text": "A 26-year-old woman with recurrent attacks of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, ataxia and dysarthria presented for a possible diagnosis of vestibular migraine. Unique to her attacks was if she could fall asleep for as little as 15â€‰min the spells would subside. If however she remained awake the attacks would continue unabated. A presumed diagnosis of episodic ataxia type 2 was made and she became attack free on acetazolamide without recurrence. Genetic testing demonstrated a novel pathogenic variant in CACNA1A on chromosome 19. This pathogenic variant has not been previously reported in the literature and is suggested to truncate the CACNA1A polypeptide by introducing a premature stop codon."
