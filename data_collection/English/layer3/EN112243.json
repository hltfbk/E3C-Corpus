  "text": "A 48-year-old woman with progressing symptoms of dyspnea and palpitations for over 2 months was referred to a cardiologist. With the help of echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance cardiac sarcoma was suspected. Open biopsy and cytoreductive surgery were performed, complete resection of the tumor was not possible. Histology revealed undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Seven cycles of chemotherapy with Doxorubicine and Ifosfamide were completed. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance revealed a complete response - only signs of fibrosis without any signs of tumor were visible. Follow ups with echocardiography, cardiovascular magnetic resonance and chest, abdomen and pelvic computed tomography is performed every 3 months. Twenty-six months from initial diagnosis the patient is still free of recurrence of tumor with no compromises of the quality of life."
