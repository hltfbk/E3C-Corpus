  "text": "A 48-year-old female presented to the emergency department after an acute ingestion of 6 g of lamotrigine. The patient suffered from bipolar disorder, and she was taking lamotrigine and olanzapine. At that point, she had a major depressive episode, and she wanted to commit suicide. Activated charcoal was administered in the emergency department. Her vital signs were still normal, and she entered the Medical clinic, where she had been there for 2 days in a good condition. The hematological and biochemical results were normal. On the fourth day, the levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) showed remarkable increase (2500 IU/ml). Fluid and bicarbonate intravenous administration was performed, and CPK levels returned to normal after 3 days."
