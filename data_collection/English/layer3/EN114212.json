  "text": "A 25-year-old male presented with a history of trivial fall from a ladder and landing on the right heel. He complained of pain and swelling. On examination, he had swelling over the medial aspect of the right heel. The skin over the swelling was stretched, and it was soft in consistency and tender. Curettage and bone grafting was done. The patient was pain-free and was bearing weight fully on the operated limb, 12 weeks postoperatively."
