  "text": "We present here a case of a 51-year-old man presenting with a 2-day history of melena. Gastroscopy showed fresh blood, as well as a mass lesion and cavity at the fundus. Biopsies of the mass edge reported the occurrence of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and mild chronic gastritis. Computed tomography imaging showed a 5.1Ã—6.5 cm cystic mass in the gastric greater curvature. The patient received six cycles of epirubicin, capecitabine, and oxaliplatin, followed by uncomplicated total gastrectomy."
