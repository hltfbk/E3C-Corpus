  "text": "A 48-year-old male with adult onset citrullinemia type II was scheduled for urethral scrotal fistula repair. During the first operation, spinal anesthesia with conscious sedation using dexmedetomidine was used, a second operation was performed after confirmation of infection control and a stable neurologic condition. In this patient, dietary planning with close monitoring of serum ammonia level and close observation of neurologic conditions might lead to successful perioperative care."
