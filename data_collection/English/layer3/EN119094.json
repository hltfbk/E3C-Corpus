  "text": "We report an uncommon case of an angiolipoma found in the lower portion of the small bowel of an 80-year-old man who was undergoing evaluation for chronic anaemia. A standardised diagnostic pathway was followed. Endoscopic and radiological findings were negative. The diagnosis was finally established with the aid of capsule endoscopy. The case we report is the first in the literature of an angiolipoma without specific painful symptoms. In fact, the patient did not complain of abdominal pain or alvus changes, and abdominal examination did not suggest an expansive process. The endoscopic study performed with the capsule identified the lesion as the cause of the ingravescent anaemia. Intra-operative histological examination of the lesion made it possible to avoid a major surgical procedure and assured a short postoperative course for the patient."
