  "text": "Herein, we describe a patient with nephrotic syndrome related to treatment with an anti-PD1 antibody for Hodgkin lymphoma. Following the third dose of anti-PD1 antibody, the patient developed massive proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. Kidney biopsy showed diffuse podocyte foot process effacement upon electron microscopy, which was consistent with minimal change disease. Corticosteroid treatment yielded full and rapid remission of nephrotic syndrome in 1Â month."
