  "text": "We describe a patient suffering from extra- and intradural myxopapillary ependymoma with perisacral spreading. He was treated with subtotal resection and postoperative radiation therapy. After treatment, he experienced slight sphincter disorders and lumboischialgic pain with no motor or sensory disturbances. Eight months later, a tumour regression was documented. The patient is still followed-up regularly."
