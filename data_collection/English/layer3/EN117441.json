  "text": "A 69-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for an operation concerning umbilical hernia. Subsequent imaging examinations before an operation indicated the presence of primary cardiac malignant tumor due to its atypical shape. And then, it was surgically removed. Histopathologically, tumor cells consisted of two different types: spindle and polyhedral cells. Immunohistochemically, it is interesting to note that 2.1% of spindle cells and 23.1% of polyhedral cells showed positive reactivity for myogenin. Furthermore, we performed double-immunostaining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and myogenin. The rates of alpha-SMA and myogenin double negative, alpha-SMA single positive, myogenin single positive, and alpha-SMA and myogenin double positive in spindle cells were estimated as 69.1%, 28.8%, 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively. In contrast, the rates in polyhedral cells were estimated as 76.9%, 0.0%, 23.1%, and 0.0%, respectively."
