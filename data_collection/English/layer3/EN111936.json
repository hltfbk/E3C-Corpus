  "text": "In this study, we report a female child with POLR3-related leukodystrophy manifesting as cognitive decline, moderate dysarthria, motor decline, cerebellar syndrome, short stature, dysphagia, hypodontia, and mild delayed myelination by brain imaging. Interestingly, polytrichia and bronchodysplasia were first observed in a POLR3-related leukodystrophy patient. Medical exome sequencing with high coverage depth was employed to identify potential genetic variants in the patient. Novel compound heterozygous mutations of the POLR3A gene, c.1771-6C > G and c.2611del (p.M871Cfs*8), were detected. One of them is an uncommon splice site mutation, and this is the first report of this mutation in a Chinese family. The father was determined to be a heterozygous carrier of the c.2611del (p.M871Cfs*8) mutation and the mother a heterozygous carrier of the c.1771-6C > G mutation."
