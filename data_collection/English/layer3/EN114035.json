  "text": "We present a 10-year-old muslim Cameroonian child from an enclaved rural area, brought to the hospital 12Â h after a snake bite to the face, with signs of severe envenomation. Despite the suboptimal anti-venom dose administered to this patient due to a stock out of this medication, supportive therapy was beneficial in ensuring a positive outcome and satisfactory recovery."
