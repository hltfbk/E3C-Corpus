  "text": "We report the case of a 38-year-old Bulgarian homosexual man who was coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis. His skin contained multiple extensive necrotic lesions with abundant purulent secretion that covered his face, lips, scalp, and torso. Initial clinical diagnoses included varicella pustulosa and staphylococcal dermatitis. Human immunodeficiency virus infection in our patient had been established 2 years earlier in prophylactic studies, but had not been treated. Due to lack of penicillin, he was successfully treated with ceftriaxone, and the skin lesions underwent complete reversal. He also began antiretroviral therapy, which resulted in a significant effect on his immune status. Three months after the onset of antiretroviral therapy, he also achieved optimal viral suppression."
