  "text": "We present the case of a 57-year-old Albanian man with prolapses of his gallbladder and other abdominal organs into the thoracic cavity through the herniation of his right hemidiaphragm due to trauma. The diaphragmatic hernia and gallstones seen in the thorax computed tomography scan were diagnostic. The organs herniated to the thoracic cavity were placed back into the abdominal cavity, a cholecystectomy was performed and the defect in the diaphragm was repaired with a prolene mesh graft during the operation. The patient was discharged 10 days after the surgical procedure, and no complications were reported."
