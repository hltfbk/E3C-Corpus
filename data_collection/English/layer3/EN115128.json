  "text": "We present a case of a 66 year old Sinhalese Sri Lankan female, who is a strict vegetarian, presenting with one month's history suggestive of Sub-acute combined cord degeneration in the absence of haematological manifestations of anaemia. Her Serum B12 levels were significantly low, after which she was treated with hydroxycobalamine supplementation, showing marked clinical improvement of symptoms, with normalization of serum B12 levels. Hence, the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency was confirmed retrospectively."
