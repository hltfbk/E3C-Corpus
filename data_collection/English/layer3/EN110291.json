  "text": "In November 2013, a healthy 42-year-old non smoker woman with a history of secondary infertility unexplored, presented in the emergency department with a spontaneous right sided chest pain associated with dyspnea occuring one week after menses. The X-ray chest revealed a right pneumothorax. The initial treatment consisted on the insertion of an intercostal chest drain. Because of a persistent air leak under chest tube after 10 days, Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) was performed and revealed multiple diaphragmatic fenestrations with an upper right nodule. A large part of the diaphragm was resected, removing the defects associated with a wedge resection of the nodule. Pleural abrasion was then performed over the diaphragm. The patient's recovery was uneventful and she was discharged home few days later. Samples of the pulmonary and the diaphragmatic nodules were performed. Microscopically, the latest one showed a small endometrial focus including siderophages dues to former hemorrhages. The pulmonary nodule corresponds to a fibrous scar tissue. Two months after surgery, the patient was followed and was not symptomatic at the time of her menstruations. Pelvic and chest MRI were performed as part of the assessment of the lesions of the disease. Chest MRI revealed no other diaphragmatic foci. Pelvic MRI revealed in both axial and sagittal sequences suggestive lesions of pelvic endomtriosis. Medical treatment with GnRH agonists was prescribed. After recovery, the patient has been symptoms free for 20 months."
