  "text": "A 64-year old female was diagnosed with MacTel 2, four years prior to the current presentation on the basis of an OCT demonstrating bilateral ILM drape sign. Fluorescein angiography showed bilateral dilated, ectatic capillaries and late phase dye leak. At the current presentation there was bilateral gradual visual impairment over two months due to bilateral foveal detachments. Treatment with intravitreal Bevacizumab resulted in unmasking of the pre-existing ILM drape sign at 12â€‰weeks. Visual acuity was reduced to counting fingers in the left eye with the neovascular membrane as a consequence of sub-retinal fibrosis, while the right eye maintained a vision of 6/12. A difference in the stage of the disease at presentation determined the long-term visual outcome after seven years of observation."
