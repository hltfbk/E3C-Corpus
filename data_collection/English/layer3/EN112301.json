  "text": "Here we are reporting a case of SMAS in a 6-year-old girl with the complaint of chronic abdominal pain since 3 years. She suffered from growth failure, while different workups were negative. Ultimately, imaging investigations detected superior mesenteric artery syndrome as an etiologic background. In the additional investigations, it is found that she suffered from celiac disease."
