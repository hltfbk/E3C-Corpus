  "text": "We treat 2 children both girls (one was of 4 years and other was 7 years of age). In both cases dislocation was unilateral and was not associated with any facture. Both cases were of posterior dislocation. in both cases open reduction and internal fixation was done by k wires. Hip spica was applied post operatively in both cases. The k wire was removed at 3 to 4 weeks. Patients were allowed to bear weight from gradual to full weight bearing after 6 weeks."
