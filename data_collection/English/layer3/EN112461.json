  "text": "We present a case of chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis with radial nerve injury, in which radical surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotic administration were done. A 12-year-old boy with a history of falling from the three-meter-high tree had swollen, deformed, and neglected humerus bone exposed. After stabilisation in the emergency room, surgical limb amputation was scheduled, yet the family refused this medical care and chose debridement instead."
