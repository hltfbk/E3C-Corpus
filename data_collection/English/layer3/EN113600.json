  "text": "A 53-year old man with a history of asthma and nasal polyposis presented with acute chest pain and elevated troponin; a percutaneous coronary intervention was performed. The left ventricle was described as hypertrophic. After 20Â days the myocardium had markedly increased in thickness of both the right and left ventricle. Evaluation revealed hypereosinophilia in the blood and nasal mucosal tissue, which confirmed the diagnosis of EGPA. He presented with signs of active vasculitis including weight loss, tiredness, intracerebral hemorrhage, and increasing serum creatinine. After 6 days of corticosteroid treatment, the myocardium returned to its initial thickness."
