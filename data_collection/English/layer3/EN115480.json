  "text": "A 42-year-old male patient was seen at consultation presenting with a pulsatile, warm and slightly painful right latero-cervical swelling extending to the supraclavicular fossa with the presence of collateral venous circulation for three weeks prior to presentation associated with a mild headache. There were oral and genital ulcerations and erythematous skin lesions associated with a history of inflammatory recurrent arthralgia. Chest computed tomo-angiography showed cruoric internal jugular vein thrombosis extending to the superior vena cava with significant venous collateral circulation. The patient was treated with prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) and colchicine (2 mg/day), as well as anticoagulation with heparin and vitamin K antagonist (Acenocoumarol) with regular INR monitoring. Clinical evolution was favorable during hospitalization, with residual discrete right supraclavicular swelling. There was no bleeding associated with anticoagulants use."
