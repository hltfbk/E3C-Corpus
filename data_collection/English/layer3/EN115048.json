  "text": "We describe the case of a 54-year-old woman from Kosovo admitted to our emergency department with dyspnea. A transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a giant mass localized on her left atrium. Our patient underwent emergent total surgical removal of the mass. The mass extended between her left superior pulmonary vein, and extended to her left atrium and the posterior mitral valve leaflet. We formulated a surgical plan for total separation of the mass from the endocardium. Total removal was performed and her left side pulmonary veins were entirely freed from the mass. We then performed a mitral valve replacement. The differential diagnosis included other masses of the left atrium, including thrombi, vegetations, and cardiac tumors. Postsurgical histopathologic results showed a pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Six monthly follow-up cardiac and abdominal sonographic examinations revealed no tumor recidivism."
