  "text": "A 46 year old man presented to hospital with massive hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes and increased lactate three weeks following resection of a malignant melanoma from his shoulder (Clark level 5). Initially stable, he decompensated 24 to 48 hours subsequent to presentation with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, distributive shock requiring high dose vasopressor infusion, coagulopathy refractory to plasma infusion, progressive rise in liver enzymes and severe metabolic abnormalities including hyperkalemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia and hypocalcemia. Refractory to aggressive physiologic support he received palliation. Autopsy revealed >80% liver infiltration by metastatic malignant melanoma."
