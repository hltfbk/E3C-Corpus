  "text": "A case report of a 41-year-old female who presented with an obstructive, bleeding, pedunculated left nasal mass arising from the nasal septum in the anterior nasal cavity. An initial diagnosis of squamous papilloma was made and she had excision of the mass done under local anaesthesia. Tissue histology revealed lobular capillary haemangioma. The patient has been followed up for over 15 months and is still free of the lesion."
