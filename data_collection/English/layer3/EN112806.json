  "text": "A non-smoking 58-year-old female patient was initially diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion and clinically responded to initial gefitinib treatment. The patient progressed on gefitinib after >1 year and a T790M mutation was detected in tissue biopsy by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Osimertinib treatment was administrated for several months and an acquired rare EGFR G724S mutation was detected via NGS blood sample after osimertinib resistance."
