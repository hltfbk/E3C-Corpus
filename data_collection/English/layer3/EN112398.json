  "text": "An anomaly was observed in a 9-mo-old male child who was subsequently diagnosed with crossed fused renal ectopia and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). In this condition, recurrent febrile urinary tract infection can be a serious problem, and can easily cause renal damage due to relatively short ureters and high pressure in the kidney."
