  "text": "We report the case of a 14-year-old mentally challenged female patient with lymphedema of the left leg, motor difficulties, and impaired speech and sight. According to the caregiver, lymphedema was present at birth; however, the patient had not been submitted to specific treatment. Thus, only one technique, an adapted low-stretch grosgrain compression stocking, was proposed as it could be used during daily life activities. The adaptation involved the grosgrain stocking, fastened using eyelets and cord up to the thigh, being sewn onto a pair of cotton shorts. The result was a clinical improvement with reductions in the perimeter and volume due to the compliance of the patient and the family to treatment."
