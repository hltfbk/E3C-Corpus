  "text": "A 26-year-old, 9-month female patient, with no significant past medical history (the patient denies medication intake, herbs like aconite, trouble during delivery, any heart issues or family history of sudden death or cardiomyopathies) who presents to the emergency room due to 11 days of dyspnea, exacerbated by daily activities, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She presented with ventricular bigeminy and systolic dysfunction with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <20%. The patient later developed a stable ventricular tachycardia (VT) treated with amiodarone, which resulted in hemodynamic instability and BVT rhythm with VT paroxysms. Without the possibility of ablation, the use of high dose beta blockers and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator resulted in the same rhythm with a lower heart rate, better NYHA functional class, and less episodes of VTs."
