  "text": "A 19-year-old Chinese boy was referred to our urgent surgery for a week-long melena and abdominal pain. In the past four years, he had persisted iron-supplement orally for unexplained recurrent episodes of hypochromic anemia. Physical examination revealed dark bluish, compressible and refillable, multiple papules with definite boundary on trunk and extremities, as well as fixed tenderness in lower abdomen without guardness. Abdominal computed tomography on admission demonstrated the presence of intestinal intussusception according to the typical sign of concentric circle, thus an exploratory laparotomy was determined. After the upper mid-line incision, a 30-centimeter-long jejunojejunal intussusception without apparent necrosis about 150cm beyond the ligament of Treitz was identified. During the course of tentative manual reduction, two serosal hemangiomas on the incarcerated intestinal was detected, which necessitated the following removal of incarcerated intestine. So far, the diagnosis of BRBNS was defined according to distinct multifocal dermatic and intestinal hemangiomas. To exclude the potential gastrointestinal venous malformation anywhere else, intraoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and then a wedge gastrectomy was carried out because of a isolated angioeoplasm found in gastric lumen. Subsequently, an innocent colon was confirmed via intraoperative transanus colonoscopy. Because there was no disinfected enteroscope available during operation, the scheme of intraoperative transparietal enteroscopy was abandoned. Postsurgery, skull and chest CT scanning was utilized and no further lesion was observed. The postoperative course was uneventful and pathological examination revealed multiple cavernous hemangiomas in the resected gastrointestines and eventually the patient recovered uneventfully."
