  "text": "We report the case of a patient who developed progressive weakness of the limbs in his fifties, until he was confined to a wheelchair. At that time, he developed acute behavioural changes including irritability, severe anxiety and major depression, which led to him being hospitalised in a psychiatric hospital. He also suffered from aphasia and executive function impairment, which helped us to diagnose a behavioural form of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The diagnosis of IBMPFD due to a mutation in the VCP gene was confirmed by a genetic study of the VCP gene (R155H mutation)."
