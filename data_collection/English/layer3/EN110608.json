  "text": "We report a case of a 64-year-old woman with bilateral Charcot knees. Her knee joints had become increasingly unstable with severe deformity over 1 year, and she has been unable to walk for1 month before hospitalization. We performed the first TKA of the right knee using rotating hinge prosthesis with a combination of autologous bone graft and metal tibial block augmentation; lateral release and patellar replacement were also performed. Three months after the first surgery, we performed the second TKA for her left knee using a constrained condylar prosthesis with a combination of lateral retinaculum release and patella replacement. At the 6-month follow-up, both knees were stable and in good alignment. There were no signs of loosening or fracture. The patient experienced no pain and was able to ambulate in her household using a walker."
