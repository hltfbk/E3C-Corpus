  "text": "A 25-year-old male patient presented to our center with complaints of the right buttock and groin pain for 8weeks. He had a history of an unstable thoracolumbar fracture treated by a short segment posterior stabilization 5years back. On examination and investigations, we found that the right-sided rod migrated into the posterior sacrum and partly into the pelvis. The fracture had united well in kyphosis. Anticipating complications, the rod was removed through an incision over buttock. The other implants were also removed. The patient was asymptomatic at 2-year follow-up."
