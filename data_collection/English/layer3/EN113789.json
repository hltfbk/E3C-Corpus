  "text": "A 65-year-old male presented with progressive back pain and right S1 radiculopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a right-sided posterolateral intradural/extramedullary lesion at the L5-S1 level. It was hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2-weighted images; on the short TI inversion recovery sequence it was hyperintense. The lesion was excised through a right L5 hemilaminectomy, and the patient was neurologically intact postoperatively. Histopathology revealed a chronic subdural hematoma."
