  "text": "A newborn female, diagnosed prenatally with hydrocephalus, is presented at birth with increasing head circumference and Parinaud's syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging scans demonstrated a huge posterior fossa tumor with obstructive hydrocephalus. At surgery, through a suboccipital craniotomy, complete excision was achieved of a histological-proven immature teratoma. The infant received adjuvant chemotherapy for 1â€‰year. She had normal neurological development and remained tumor-free through her 20-year follow-up."
