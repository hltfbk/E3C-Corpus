  "text": "A 66-year-old female presented after cardiac arrest in which return of spontaneous circulation was achieved within 7 minutes after the initiation of CPR. She was intubated on the scene and found to have coffee ground emesis in her bathroom when found unresponsive. Due to the hemodynamically significant GI bleed, patient was started on IV proton pump inhibitor, octreotide, and levophed. Subsequent endoscopy showed diffuse severe mucosal changes characterized by blackness, erythema, friability, granularity, inflammation, and decreased vascular pattern in the middle third of the esophagus and in the lower third of the esophagus."
