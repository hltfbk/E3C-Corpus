  "text": "We present a case of a 16-year-old Caucasian boy with a massive arterial and venous thrombosis in his lower limbs as well as in his central nervous system with clinical symptoms such as headaches and chorea. He did not present any clinical or laboratory signs of a systemic inflammatory connective tissue disease, including systemic lupus erythematosus. Based on the clinical picture and results of the diagnostic tests (positive antibodies against Î²2-glycoprotein and a high titre of anticardiolipin antibodies) we finally diagnosed primary antiphospholipid syndrome. During a 9-month follow up after the acute phase of the disease, he was treated with low-molecular-weight heparin. Neurological symptoms were relieved. Features of recanalization in the vessels of his lower limbs were observed. After a subsequent 6 months, because of the failure of preventive treatment - an incident of thrombosis of the vessels of his testis - treatment was modified and heparin was replaced with warfarin."
