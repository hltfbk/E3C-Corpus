  "text": "We report the case of a 34-year-old woman with a 2-year history of relapsing pustular eruptions mainly affecting the abdomen, gluteus region, elbows, and the extremities. Four years after the onset of subcorneal pustular dermatosis (SPD), she developed pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) on her right hand. In literature, the coexistence of SPD and PG in the same patient has already been described. This co-occurrence might indicate a certain predisposition for immune dysregulation."
