  "text": "We describe two cases of non-traumatic acetabular and vertebrae fractures following seizures without history of epilepsy. They occurred in two male patients, 18 and 48 years old suffering respectively from hypercorticism and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Seizures, occurring inside hospital, were secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy crisis with hypokaliemia in the first case and severe hypoglycaemia in the second one. Fracture was promoted by a decrease in mineral bone density caused respectively by hypercorticism and diabetic chronic renal failure."
