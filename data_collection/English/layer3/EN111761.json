  "text": "A 52-year old previously healthy woman underwent resection of a large intraventricular meningioma. A small fragment of residual tumor with no obvious enlargement of the temporal horn was observed 3 mo after surgery, and she was referred for GKS. Two months after GKS, she complained of headache and progressive paralysis of the left limb. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed enlargement of the temporal horn. There was a second procedure to resect the residual tumor 8 mo after GKS. After the second procedure, she recovered smoothly. As of the date of this writing, she has remained in good condition."
