  "text": "This study reports the case of a wandering spleen attached to the omentum (with blood supply from the omentum) in the pelvic area, with ectopic appendix (located in the right upper quadrant), ectopic liver (located in the abdominal midline), and ectopic stomach (located in the right upper abdominal region), in a 15-year-old male complaining about abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and lack of appetite, who was referred to the hospital. The patient underwent laparotomy with the diagnosis of acute abdomen; the twisted ectopic spleen in the pelvis was removed and appendectomy was also performed. The clinical manifestations of wandering spleen vary extensively, and its presurgical diagnosis is difficult in the absence of radiological studies. Therefore, spleen torsion has to be considered as a diagnosis for acute abdomen in order to prevent necrosis of the spleen and other related complications."
