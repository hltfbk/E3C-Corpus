  "text": "A 24-year-old Moroccan man presented a malignant ameloblastoma of the mandible. The tumor was entirely resected. Five years later, a local recurrence occurred. Our patient was treated by exclusive radiotherapy with persistence of a residual disease. After two years he developed multiple lung metastases. Our patient received a combination chemotherapy using doxorubicin and cisplatin."
