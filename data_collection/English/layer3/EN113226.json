  "text": "We report a case of concomitant C3GN and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) after pulmonary infection in a young male receiving kidney transplantation. Genetic assessment revealed two missense variations in compound heterozygous form in CFI gene (complement factor I). These two variations are segregated with disease in the core family member of this patient. Plasma CFI levels of the patient and family members were all in normal range. We considered that these two variations only impair CFI function rather than its quantity in the serum."
