  "text": "A 42-year-old woman was found to have a mass in the left flank during her annual medical checkup. Computed tomography examination revealed a submucosal tumor of the descending colon. Surgeons and radiologists suspected that the lesion was a GIST, and left hemicolectomy was performed without biopsy. Microscopic examination showed that the lesion was composed of spindle and epithelioid cells, which were immunohistochemically negative for c-kit and positive for platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α. Initial diagnosis of PDGFRα-positive GIST was made. However, gene analysis did not reveal mutations in PDGFRα. Additional immunohistochemistry showed that tumor cells were positive for human melanin black 45 (HMB45), melanA, and the myogenic marker calponin. A final diagnosis of PEComa was made."
