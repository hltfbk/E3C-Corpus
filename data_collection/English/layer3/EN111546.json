  "text": "We describe a patient with relapsed refractory CTCL (Sézary Syndrome) who underwent allo-HCT with persistence of disease post-transplant. The patient additionally developed a progressively worsening lesion on the right shoulder which was biopsied and showed poorly differentiated carcinoma (cSCC). Pembrolizumab was started for the treatment of cSCC. After second cycle of treatment, the cSCC lesion responded dramatically to the use of immune checkpoint inhibitor. Also, the patient experienced significant resolution of pruritus and generalized erythema. During 24 months of follow up after initial treatment with checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy, the patient showed durable response of both cSCC and CTCL, as well as restoration of full donor chimerism, without obvious worsening of graft versus host disease (GVHD)."
