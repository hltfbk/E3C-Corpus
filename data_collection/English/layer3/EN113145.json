  "text": "We found out that the etiologic agent was Brucella in our two cases admitted with acute hepatitis presentation in the investigations conducted. Liver transaminases were as follows for case 1 and case 2; AST: 306/187U/L, ALT: 368/312U/L, ALP: 355/264U/L, GGT: 116/197U/L, LDH: 887/549U/L, respectively. Sacroiliitis also accompanied the clinical picture in our first case. Our patients showed clinical and laboratory improvement with rifampicin, doxycycline, (additional streptomycin for 21 days in the patient with sacroiliitis) treatment."
