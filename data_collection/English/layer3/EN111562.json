  "text": "A 50-year-old woman was hospitalized for angina, angiography revealed triple vessel disease, CTO accompanied with stent fracture in right coronary artery (RCA). Treatment using conventional coronary intervention was expected to be difficult. Therefore, we performed RASER technique, which was a combination of excimer laser coronary atherectomy (ELCA) with rotational atherectomy (RA), followed by the deployment of drug-eluting stents. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) revealed well attachment of the stents, the patient was discharged 3 days after the procedure and no recurrent chest discomfort was reported in a follow-up time of 10 months."
