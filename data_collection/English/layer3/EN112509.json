  "text": "Our patient presented with a history of hypercholesterolemia and referred asthenia and heaviness in both legs. She was born from healthy and non-consanguineous parents and her development was normal. She had not familiarity for early cardiovascular disease, and did not report personal history of hypertension, chronic kidney or liver diseases. Clinical laboratories results showed critically reduced value of albumin whereas other serum proteins were elevated. Main causes of hypoalbuminemia (proteinuria, inflammatory state and insufficient hepatic synthesis) were ruled out by normal procedures and laboratory tests. So the hypothesis of a CAA was tested through mutation analysis of the albumin gene that revealed a homozygous CA deletion in exon 12, at nucleotide positions c1614-1615. This finding brought to the diagnosis of CAA. Currently the patient receives Atorvastatin 20 mg od and undergoes clinical and laboratory follow-up every six months. She never needed albumin infusions."
