  "text": "Herein, we report a case of acute intestinal obstruction secondary to ingestion of large pebbles and IDA in a 5-year-old Nigerian boy. The patient was managed conservatively with the use of laxatives and a rectal wash-out, and the pebbles were excreted over 3 days. Oral iron therapy was also commenced with cessation of pica."
