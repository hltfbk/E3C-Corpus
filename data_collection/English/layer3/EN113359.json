  "text": "A 27-year-old Sri Lankan male, with history of heavy alcohol use, presented with progressive abdominal distension following an episode of acute pancreatitis. Contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen showed a large multilocular cystic lesion almost occupying the entire abdominal cavity and displacing the liver medially and the right dome of the diaphragm superiorly. The largest locule in the right side measured as 30 cm × 15 cm × 14 cm. Endoscopic ultrasound guided drainage of the cyst was performed. The cyst was entered into with an electrocautery-assisted cystotome and a lumen-opposing metal stent was deployed under fluoroscopic vision followed by dilatation with a 10 mm controlled radial expansion balloon. Repeat endoscopic ultrasound was done a week later due to persistence of the collection and a second stent was inserted. Then 10 French gauge × 10 cm double ended pigtails were inserted through both stents. The cysts were not visualized on subsequent Ultra sound scans. Stent removal was done after 3 weeks, leaving the pigtails insitu. The patient made an uneventful recovery."
