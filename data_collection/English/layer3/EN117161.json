  "text": "A 59-year-old African-American man was incidentally found to have a bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma involving the bilateral lower lobes of his lungs. In addition, bone marrow involvement was discovered. His course was indolent with only some mild respiratory symptoms. He received single agent treatment with rituximab. No evidence of progression was seen at the end of receiving this regimen. Two years after treatment our patient presented with B symptoms. Imaging now showed significant increase in the size of the lung masses with cavitation of the right lower lobe mass. A repeat transbronchial biopsy suggested transformation to an aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma."
