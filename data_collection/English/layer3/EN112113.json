  "text": "A 35-year-old male patient was presented to the ER with an occupational craniofacial injury because of an IOFB. The patient underwent an extra-dural orbitocranial craniotomy procedure to remove the foreign body. Interestingly, a plastic foreign body (a piece of a plastic pipe) was removed from the orbital cavity, which was suspected to be a fractured orbital bone, at first place."
