  "text": "This report describes 10 unrelated cystic fibrosis cases with phenotypic features of cystic fibrosis and abnormal or intermediate sweat tests. The most common phenotypic features in this sample of symptomatic patients were persistent or recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, failure to thrive and Pseudo-Bartter syndrome. Altogether 7 cystic fibrosis causing mutations were identified in 10 patients. Except delta F508 which is the commonest mutation worldwide all the other mutations detected in Sri Lankan patients are rare mutations. 1161delC and V456A detected in our patients are South Asian mutations. The other mutations such as [C.1282C > G; C.2738A > G], C.53 + 1G > C, 2184insA and a deletion encompassing exons 4 to 11 have been reported previously from European patients with cystic fibrosis."
