  "text": "A 66-year-old female presented for a pre-implant CBCT with no history of other complaints or signs/symptoms. CBCT imaging depicts a large, well-defined, low-attenuation/soft tissue density lesion with an undulating appearance extending from the posterior left pharyngeal wall and occluding two-thirds of the airway from C2 to C4. The lesion extends laterally into the left parapharyngeal space and inferiorly beyond the field of view of the study. Evidence of faint internal septations was noted. The patient was immediately referred for an ENT consult. Laryngoscopy, MRI, and contrast-enhanced MDCT imaging were conducted to determine the full extent and nature of the lesion, as well as to potentially plan for biopsy and/or surgical resection. Removal of the lesion was successful, and histopathologic evaluation confirmed lipoma. Periodic follow-up was recommended to monitor for possible recurrence."
