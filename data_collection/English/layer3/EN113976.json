  "text": "A 61-year-old woman was diagnosed with minimal change-type nephrotic syndrome in October 2012. She received prednisolone (PSL) and cyclosporin A (CyA), but she experienced several cycles of relapse and remission and was hospitalized in May 2016 due to relapse. However, in spite of steroid pulse therapy and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration, her urinary protein level did not improve. We started her on evolocumab with the expectation of equivalent LDL-lowering effects as seen with LDL apheresis. After that, the LDL cholesterol level and UP/UC were concomitantly decreased, and the serum albumin was increased. This was maintained even when we reduced the PSL dose. This suggests that evolocumab clinically improves the nephrotic condition."
