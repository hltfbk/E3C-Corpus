  "text": "A 71-year old Caucasian male, diagnosed with IPF three years earlier, presented with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. ANCA were found both in current and historical sera. A kidney biopsy sample was taken, which revealed a pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, but also areas of glomerular fibrosis, hence strongly suggesting unrecognized flares of an indolent vasculitis in his past. This made the diagnosis of \"idiopathic\" pulmonary fibrosis very unlikely."
