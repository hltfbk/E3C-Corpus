  "text": "We present the case of a 62-year-old Japanese man with double cancers: a tongue SCC and a cutaneous SCC. Swelling of the finger lesion developed gradually around the entire remaining middle finger after accidental amputation at the proximal interphalangeal joint. Histopathological examination of the tumor on the stump of the amputated finger indicated a well-differentiated SCC. The past history indicated surgery for SCC of the tongue 3 years earlier; with histopathology of moderately-differentiated SCC."
