  "text": "A 47-year-old female, native from Congo and resident in France, was admitted in hospital for uncomplicated falciparum malaria with parasitaemia of 0.5%, after travelling in Congo (Brazzaville and Pointe Noire). She was treated with atovaquone-proguanil (250 mg/100 mg) 4 tablets daily for 3 consecutive days. On day 5 after admission she was released home. However, many weeks after this episode, without having left France, she again experienced fever and intense weakness. On day 39 after the beginning of treatment, she consulted for fever, arthralgia, myalgia, photophobia, and blurred vision. She was hospitalized for uncomplicated falciparum malaria with a parasitaemia of 0.375% and treated effectively by piperaquine-artenimol (320 mg/40 mg) 3 tablets daily for 3 consecutive days. Resistance to atovaquone-proguanil was suspected. The Y268C mutation was detected in all of the isolates tested (D39, D42, D47). The genotyping of the pfdhfr gene showed a triple mutation (N51I, C59R, S108N) involved in cycloguanil resistance."
