  "text": "A 52-year-old Japanese man with lower abdominal pain underwent lower endoscopy, revealing a type 2 lesion in the rectosigmoid colon. He was diagnosed with rectosigmoid colon cancer with multiple lung metastases and a horseshoe kidney on computed tomography (CT) scan. Three-dimensional (3D)-CT angiography showed an aberrant renal artery at the isthmus from 3Â cm under the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) branch of the aorta. Laparoscopic anterior rectal resection was performed. During the operation, the inferior mesenteric artery, left ureter, left gonadal vessels, and hypogastric nerve plexus could be seen passing over the horseshoe kidney isthmus and were preserved. The left branch of aberrant renal artery that was close to IMA was also detected and preserved."
