  "text": "A 14-year-old German girl from South Africa came to the surgery with painful swelling in the right clavicle. The condition had first appeared two months earlier. The patient was unable to identify a trigger. In addition, the patient exhibited painless swelling in the area of the 5th metatarsal of the left foot. Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis was diagnosed based on characteristic clinical symptoms and imaging. Treatment with ibuprofen had caused the symptoms to regress rapidly."
