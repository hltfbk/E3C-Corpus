  "text": "Case 1: a 66-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with a rupture of an aneurysm of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. Because of the difficulty of endovascular therapy, we performed an emergency operation. We chose an abdominal operation, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Case 2: a 75-year-old Japanese man presented at our hospital with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and cold sweat. Our experience of treating MAL syndrome in case 1 enabled us to diagnose the disease accurately. We chose laparoscopic surgery, and the postoperative course was uneventful."
