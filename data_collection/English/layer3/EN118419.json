  "text": "A confused 89-year-old man with back pain secondary to metastatic prostatic carcinoma was prescribed soluble paracetamol. Ten days later, his serum sodium concentration had increased from 142 mmol/L to 165 mmol/L. Soluble paracetamol was withdrawn shortly before he died, and was believed to have contributed to his hypernatremia."
