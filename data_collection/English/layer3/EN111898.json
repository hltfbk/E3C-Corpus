  "text": "A 20-year-old woman presented with worsening pain in her left ankle. Imaging studies showed multifocal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid [maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), 15.95] osteolytic lesions in the bones of her left lower extremity. While waiting for the definitive pathologic diagnosis of PMHE, denosumab, a human immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody against RANKL, was initiated to treat progressive bone absorption after curettage of one of the lesions. Denosumab induced osteosclerosis around the lesions and pain relief and was discontinued 4â€‰years after its initiation. Although all of the multifocal lesions remained, they all became less FDG-avid (SUVmax, 2.6), and the patient developed no signs of new lesions or distant metastasis."
