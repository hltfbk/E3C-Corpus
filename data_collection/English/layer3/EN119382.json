  "text": "A 6-year-old Native American boy hospitalized for treatment of lymphadenitis and aseptic meningitis had an incidental brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding of effusions in the TMJs, as well as the atlanto-occipital and C1-C2 articulations. Repeat TMJ and cervical spine MRI four weeks later showed resolution of effusions. Reactive TMJ arthritis has been previously reported in adults but not in children."
