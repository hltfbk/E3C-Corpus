  "text": "A 60-year-old Caucasian man was referred for persistent infection of the right maxillary sinus. A maxillary sinus benign cyst had been removed three months before. Computed tomography showed a sinus opacity evoking a cyst recurrence. A new operation was planned to remove the cyst by a Caldwell-Luc approach. After excision of very thick fibrous tissue, a compress was discovered in the maxillary sinus. The patient did not present with any sinus infection after the operation."
