  "text": "Here, we present a case of multiple cavernous hemangiomas of the skull with dural tail sign in a 24-year-old man. No abnormalities were observed in the right orbit by craniography, but frontal bone destruction was unintentionally discovered. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated multiple intraosseous lesions that destroyed the surrounding bone and intracranial extension. Total resection of the two lesions and cranioplasty were performed. Histological examination confirmed the lesions as a cavernous hemangioma."
