  "text": "A 75-year-old wheelchair-bound Caucasian man with bilateral above-knee amputations presented to our hospital after a fall. Plain radiographs showed an intertrochanteric fracture of the femur, and operative fixation with a dynamic hip screw was planned. His positioning on the table posed a particular problem, and therefore we developed a technique to overcome this problem."
