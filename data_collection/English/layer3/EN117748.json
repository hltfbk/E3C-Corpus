  "text": "A 52-year-old Caucasian woman presented with right-sided abdominal pain, ascites and jaundice. An MRI scan revealed a tumor mass located in the gallbladder wall and involving the liver. A partial hepatectomy and cholecystectomy were performed. Histology revealed a neuroendocrine tumor, which showed scattered Grimelius positive cells and immuno-expressed epithelial and endocrine markers. Our patient is undergoing chemotherapy treatment."
