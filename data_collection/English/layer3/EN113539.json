  "text": "We report a rare case of multiloculated thymic cyst in an 8-year-old boy on the right side of the neck. Perioperative diagnosis was a cystic hygroma. Macroscopic examination showed a cystic mass measuring 6.5Â cm in total length. Histopathology of the excised specimen revealed thymic tissue with prominent Hassall's corpuscles associated with multiloculated cyst. The cyst wall is bordered by a flattened or multilayered epithelium, often abraded."
