  "text": "We present a 17-year-old girl having mirror foot with dysplastic trapezoid shaped tibia. She had mild equinovarus deformity of the right foot with three pre-axial extra digits that represent a mirror foot. There was also a gross shortening of the right leg with 20Â° fixed flexion deformity of the knee, but she could walk around with limited disability. Her chief complaint was difficulty in outdoor ambulation and poor cosmesis of the foot. Limb reconstruction may not have a predictable outcome with so much of shortening and she was also reluctant for amputation. A course of therapy was given with a treatment objective of improvement of knee flexion deformity and quadriceps control. She was fitted with an extension prosthesis which accommodates the deformed foot and also corrected the limb length discrepancy."
