  "text": "A 30-year-old female patient was admitted to General Surgery outpatient clinic with complaints of abdominal pain which lasted for about 10 days and worsened during last 2 days. Abdominal pain was on both upper quadrants, especially on the right upper quadrant. Apart from abdominal pain, there was not any significant complaint (nausea, vomiting, absence of bowel movements, dysuria, etc). The patient's physical examination revealed normal blood pressure, pulse and body temperature and no abdominal distension. Tenderness was present on right upper quadrant, however, there was no rebound and bowel sounds were normal. Cardiac and pulmonary examination revealed no pathology.\nLeukocyte count (9.46x109/L), hemoglobin, hematocrit values and CRP (C reactive protein) and all other biochemical parameters were within normal limits in the laboratory tests performed. Whole abdominal ultrasound revealed an increase in the diffuse wall thickening of the 10 cm-intestinal segment in the right upper quadrant, presumably belonging to colon and an intraabdominal echogenic mass related with this segment in the upper quadrant, midline level. Upon this finding, intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination was performed. Iliocecal junction was observed in the upper abdomen by CT scan. The colon was the herniated towards the ascending colon pouch. Intussusception at the ileocecal junction and a heterogeneous mass with fat density measuring 40x53x55 mm were observed in this region. There were dense septal appearances in the mass. According to CT scan, lipoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma were considered among the differential diagnosis. Upon these findings, the patient was operated. There was no free fluid in the abdominal cavity during surgery. A luminal mass lesion measuring 4x6 cm was found in the right colon, approximately 5 cm proximal to caecum. It was observed that the mass caused proximal invagination in the proximal colon and the lumen was severely narrowed. No other pathology was detected by inspection and digital examination in the other intraabdominal organs within the field of view. With these findings, right hemicolectomy and end-to-side ileotransversostomy was performed. In the pathological examination of the removed colon segment, the lesion was diagnosed as submucousallipoma in the colon."
