  "text": "This article describes a case of AOT in a 10-year-old girl who presented with gingival enlargement in relation to the maxillary left central incisor. Interestingly, intraoral periapical radiography did not show any significant findings. However, cone-beam computed tomography of the site revealed significant bone loss in the area. A surgical excision was done. Histopathological examination revealed features of AOT. Based on clinical, radiographic, and histological evidence, a diagnosis of peripheral AOT (PAOT) was made."
