  "text": "Two males, in their mid-twenties, were involved in a head-on motorcycle collision. Both patients sustained open fractures to their lower extremities. A large piece of bone was ejected from one patient's femur and impaled the other patient's tibia, causing an open tibial plateau fracture. The patient who provided the bony projectile underwent retrograde intramedullary nail fixation. The segmental piece of bone was not replanted, and he went on to heal without negative sequelae at 2-year follow-up."
