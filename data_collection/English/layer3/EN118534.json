  "text": "We describe the case of a Mediterranean 32-year-old man, recently returned from a trip to a Brazilian beach, which presented with a 2-week history of pruritic cutaneous lesions that had not resolved after treatment with oral antihistamines and topical fluocinolone ointment. Physical examination showed a serpiginous, erythematous and slightly elevated lesion of 2-mm wide and 7-cm long located on the posterior aspect of his left knee. Patient affirmed that the lesion advanced progressively. Laboratory analyses only revealed an elevated absolute eosinophil count. Albendazole 400 mg/d 3 days was administered to the patient with complete resolution of symptoms within 1 week."
