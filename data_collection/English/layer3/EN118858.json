  "text": "We report a case of primary pulmonary mucinous cystadenocarcinoma in a 75-year-old woman who was found to have a right hilar mass on a routine chest X-ray. A lobectomy was performed and the resection specimen revealed a multicystic mucinous tumor. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of confluent mucin-filled cystic spaces lined by columnar mucin-secreting cells which ranged from cytologically bland to moderately atypical with 'bronchioloalveolar pattern' invasion into the adjacent parenchyma. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive diffusely for Cytokeratin 7, and focally for Cytokeratin 20 and Thyroid Transcription Factor-1."
