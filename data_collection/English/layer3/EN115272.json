  "text": "A 40-year old haemodialysis-dependent patient with a 2 year history of refractory hypotension (≤80/50 mmHg) was referred for living donor renal transplantation at our tertiary centre. Each dialysis session was often less than 2 h and 30 min due to symptomatic hypotension. As part of the cardiovascular assessment, she underwent haemodynamic evaluation with cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Blood pressure normalized during unloaded pedalling but was exaggerated at maximal workload whereby it rose from 82/50 mmHg to a peak of 201/120 mmHg. Transthoracic echocardiography, tonometric measure of central vascular compliance and myocardial perfusion scan were normal. She subsequently underwent an antibody-incompatible renal transplantation and was vasopressor reliant for 14 days during the post-operative period. Eight weeks following transplant, resting blood pressure was normal and a physiological exercise-haemodynamic response was observed during a repeat cardiopulmonary exercise testing."
