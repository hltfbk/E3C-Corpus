  "text": "A 63-year-old man underwent PpPD and Child reconstruction with Braun anastomosis for lower bile duct carcinoma. Two weeks after surgery DGE occurred, and a 10Â cm long stricture from middle esophagus to cardia developed one and a half month after surgery in spite of the administration of antacids. Balloon dilation was performed, but perforation occurred. It was recovered with conservative treatment. Even the administration of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for approximately five mouths did not improve esophageal stricture. Simultaneous 24-h pH and bilirubin monitoring confirmed that this patient was resistant to PPI. We performed middle-lower esophagectomy with total gastrectomy to prevent gastric acid from injuring reconstructed organ and remnant esophagus through a right thoracoabdominal incision, and we also performed reconstruction with transverse colon, adding Roux-Y anastomosis, to prevent bile reflux to the remnant esophagus. Minor leakage developed during the postoperative course but was soon cured by conservative treatment. The patient started oral intake on the 25th postoperative day (POD) and was discharged on the 34th POD in good condition."
