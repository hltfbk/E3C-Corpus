  "text": "An 18-year-old Sri Lankan Sinhalese boy presented with a history of 1 day of fever and an episode of seizure followed by left-side hemiparesis. He was diagnosed to have dengue complicated by dengue hemorrhagic fever and recovered with minimal residual weakness. He presented with neurological symptoms; cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electroencephalogram, and magnetic resonance imaging showed evidence of encephalitis. Positive dengue antigen and antibody in serum and cerebrospinal fluid with the exclusion of other possible etiologies confirmed parainfectious dengue encephalitis. He was started on sodium valproate 200 mg 8 hourly and made a slow neurological recovery with mild residual weakness (grade 4+ power) in his left upper limb at 2 months with intensive supervised physiotherapy."
