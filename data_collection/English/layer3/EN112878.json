  "text": "A 52-year-old patient, HIV positive for fourteen (14) years and receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the last four years wanted to replace her missing teeth for effective feeding and cosmetic reasons. A diagnosis of partially edentulous maxillary and mandibular arches, cervical caries of tooth # 12, 15, 25, 34 and retained roots of tooth # 11, 13, 22 and 35 was made. Following oral health education and mouth preparation, this patient received a set of removable acrylic full upper and lower dentures."
