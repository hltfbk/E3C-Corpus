  "text": "A 41-year-old Caucasian woman originally presented with a 14.8 cm left thigh mass. She was managed with wide local resection but after 2 years she developed recurrent disease in the pelvis and in the lungs; the lung involvement was characterized by innumerable nodules without any significant respiratory symptoms. After failing three clinical trials, she experienced prolonged disease control while on treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) pazopanib and radiation therapy delivered to the pelvic lesion. Dose reduction of pazopanib due to severe diarrhea was followed by rapid disease progression in the pelvis requiring vascular stenting; increase in tumor growth after discontinuation of a TKI has been described in other malignancies and is a possibility in this specific patient."
