  "text": "A 24-year-old woman presented with a 8 month history of visual blurring with a slow decrease in visual acuity, and headache. Humphrey's visual field analysis revealed an enlarged blind spot. Dilated funduscopy showed an elevation of the left optic disc and choroidal folds above the nerve extending into the macula. General physical examination was normal. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with fat-suppression and an off-axis, coronal and sagittal views were performed, a tubular-cystic enlargement of the optic nerve sheath was identified as containing a CSF (cerbrospinal fluid)-intensity lesion that was hyperintense on T2-weighted images. There was no evidence of tumor in the brain or orbit. The subject was therefore, diagnosed as having dural ectasia of the optic nerve sheath, which is also known as optic nerve meningocoele, without intracranial hypertension. Once the diagnosis had been confirmed in surgical intervention. The patient remained stable over the next 4 months with the same visual acuity."
