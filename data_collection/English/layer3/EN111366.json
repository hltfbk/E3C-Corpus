  "text": "We report the case of an 11-year-old girl presenting with a typical history of triggering of the fourth finger, in whom a nodule attached to the flexor digitorum superficialis was found; clinical, ultrasound, and operative findings are described. Histological analysis was diagnostic of extraskeletal chondroma, also known as chondroma of soft tissues."
