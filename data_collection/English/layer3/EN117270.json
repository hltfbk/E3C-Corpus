  "text": "A 56-year-old Caucasian man with a large toxic multi-nodular goiter was surgically treated with total thyroidectomy. Both his right and left ILNs were identified, fully exposed and preserved along their cervical courses. We discovered many variations during bilateral exploration of the two ILNs. His right ILN was non-recurrent. This non-recurrent ILN showed a terminal division before laryngeal entry. The left nerve had a usual course as a recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) at his tracheaesophageal groove. We also discovered bifurcation of his RLN beginning at a neurovascular (RLN and inferior thyroid artery) crossing point. Anterior and posterior branches of both nerves entered his larynx separately. The sympathetic inferior laryngeal anastomotic branch (SILAB) between the posterior branch of his left ILN and the cervical sympathetic chain was established in the distal part of the nerve before laryngeal entry."
