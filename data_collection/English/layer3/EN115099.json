  "text": "The patient was a 68-year-old Japanese female who had presented with left hip joint pain at age 63 years. At age 51 years, she had been diagnosed with DTC and underwent partial excision. X-rays showed partial femoral head collapse, suggesting osteoarthritis or idiopathic necrosis of the left femoral head. Three years later, a (131) I whole-body scan showed accumulation in the left femoral head, resulting in a diagnosis of DTC metastasis to the left femoral head. Bipolar hip arthroplasty was performed. Examination of the excised femoral head resulted in a final diagnosis of metastasis of follicular thyroid cancer, which was limited histopathologically to the subchondral bone of the femoral head."
