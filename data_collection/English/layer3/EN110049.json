  "text": "A 39-year old woman presented with a three-day history of constipation and progressive abdominal pain without nausea or vomiting. The last bowel movement had been three days ago. There was no significant past medical history especially of chronic constipation, psychiatric disease, neurologic disease, or abdominal surgery. Physical examination revealed a moderate distension of the abdomen without signs of peritonitis. The abdomen was tympanic to percussion. There were no umbilical or groin hernias. Digital rectal examination demonstrated an empty rectal vault without intraluminal masses. Blood investigations showed normal full blood count, urea, electrolytes, and clotting profile. The abdominal X-ray revealed a large bowel obstruction with a \"U-shaped\" loop in the left upper abdomen. The computed tomography demonstrated a dilatation of the right colon and the transverse colon with a cut-off near the splenic flexure. No signs of malignancy were found. An emergency laparotomy was performed. Intra operative findings were of a transverse colon volvulus rotated in a three hundred and sixty degrees clockwise direction on its mesentery. The point of twist was found in the left upper quadrant. The bowel was intact without signs of ischemia. A significant disparity in the size of the obstructed proximal and collapsed distal colon to the site of the volvulus was noticed. The transverse colon was mobile and increased in length. The volvulus was delivered into the incision and detorsed. An extended right hemicolectomy was carried on with end-to-side ileo-colic anastomosis. The postoperative course was uneventful. Discharge from hospital was five days following admission. Histologically, the appearances were consistent with a sub acute progressive transverse colon volvulus. No acute inflammation, infarction, granulomas, dysplasia, malignancy, or vascular abnormality was noticed."
