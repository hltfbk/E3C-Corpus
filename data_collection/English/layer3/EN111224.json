  "text": "A 57-year-old woman presented with a one-month history of pain and swelling in her right foot, which were worsened by activity and improved with rest. Physical examination revealed a hard, non-mobile mass measuring 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm on the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal of the right foot. There was overlying erythema and tenderness on palpation. Computed tomography (CT) of the right foot demonstrated a fracture of the neck of the third metatarsal, osteolysis at the fracture site and soft tissue swelling. Bone scintigraphy revealed increased tracer uptake suggesting abnormal bone metabolism at the neck of the third metatarsal. Surgical excision of the lesion was performed. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of BPOP."
