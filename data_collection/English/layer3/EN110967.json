  "text": "A 70 year-old African American female with treatment-refractory schizoaffective disorder developed hypothermia with a nadir temperature of 89 °F (31.7 °C) after 7 days on clozapine, on a total dose of 50 mg twice daily. Accompanying symptoms included bradycardia, hypotension, QTc prolongation, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and an absence of shivering. The patient was transferred to the ICU, and rewarmed within 10 h with the discontinuation of her clozapine, ziprasidone, and carvedilol. Broad spectrum antibiotics were initiated, but discontinued shortly after, as the patient had no leukocytosis, and blood cultures were negative."
