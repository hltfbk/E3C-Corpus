  "text": "A 54-year-old Caucasian woman with immunoglobulin G kappa multiple myeloma on single-agent bortezomib given by intravenous push once weekly developed isolated unilateral partially reversible left sided oculomotor nerve palsy during the first cycle of treatment. All the essential diagnostic tests that were carried out excluded all other possible causes. There was a positive dechallenge-rechallenge test. Management was by withdrawal of bortezomib and empirical dexamethazone. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of its kind in the literature."
