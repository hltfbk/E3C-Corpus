  "text": "A 26-year-old man with no medical history presented with orofacial paralysis and upper limbs paresthesia. Cerebral CT-scan revealed a locally advanced 58mm osteolytic tumor in the middle of the clivus. The tumor invaded the oropharynx, the para-pharyngeal spaces and the spinal canal with brain stem compression. Cerebro-spinal MRI showed a locally aggressive lesion of the clivus invading the right cavernous sinus, T1 isointense and T2 hyper intense with heterogenous enhancement on post-contrast images. Pathology report based on conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining showed a characteristic epithelioid and partially physaliferous tumor cells arranged in lobules. Lobules were separated by thin fibrous septae embedded within a myxoid matrix resembling neo-plastic hyaline cartilage. Immunohistochemical staining showed strong positivity for pancytokeratin. Tumor cells showed also a weak cytoplasmic and nuclear positivity for S100. Therefore the diagnosis of chondroid chordoma of the clivus was retained by pathologists. Staging workup including bone scan and thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT-scan did not reveal any metastases. Surgical resection of the tumor followed by radiotherapy was decided in a multidisciplinary concertation meeting. A subtotal resection of the tumor mass was made via a retrosigmoid craniotomy approach. Pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of chondroid chordoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient reported a progressive improvement of initially reported symptoms. Four months later, the patient received Î³-knife radiation therapy with good tolerance. Seventh nerve palsy recovered completely. The patient is alive free of disease after a 12-month follow-up."
