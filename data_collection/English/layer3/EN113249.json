  "text": "A 76-year-old man and a 60-year-old woman presented with symptomatic intradural extramedullary spinal cord tumors in the cervical spine. Both patients showed a combination of spondylotic changes in the cervical spine and stenotic condition at the level of the tumor. Both tumors were successfully resected through open-door laminoplasty with hydroxyapatite (HA) spacers, with the tumor located on the side of the laminoplasty. Histological diagnosis was schwannoma for both tumors. HA spacers completely bonded to the host bone and did not interfere with postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the inside of the spinal canal. Cervical spine alignment was maintained at the final follow-up of 6Â years in both cases."
