  "text": "A 45-year old white female patient with very advanced under treatment JOAG in the left eye was prospectively investigated with the AngioVue OCT (Optovue Inc., Fremont, USA) for RNFLT and PcVD, and Octopus Normal G2 visual field testing, at 6-month intervals for 2.5 years (6 visits). Images quality was high (8/10 in 5 visits and 7/10 in one visit), and the optical media were clear. For the superior and inferior retina the baseline RNFLT and PcVD values were 48 and 43 μm, and 28.9 and 36.5%, respectively. Using the instrument's linear regression analysis significant progression (P < 0.05) was seen only for the hemifield with greater baseline RNFLT (superior RNFLT: - 0.5 μm/year) and the hemifield with greater baseline PcVD (inferior PcVD: - 2.4%/year). All inferior visual field cluster defect values progressed significantly (2.0 to 5.1 dB/year) while in the superior clusters no progression was measurable due to software indicated floor effect."
