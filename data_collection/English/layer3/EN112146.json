  "text": "The present case describes a 41-year-old male who was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease for 6 months and started taking Ayurvedic medications after the diagnosis was established. The patient was a known hypertensive for 10 years and the patient was not taking medications for hypertension. The patient had a trivial trauma 2 months back following which he was able to walk and carry out his daily activities. He developed pain over both the hip joints which were gradually progressive and pain increased to the point, wherein the patient was unable to walk 1 month after the episode of trivial trauma. The patient was admitted for inability to walk and a radiographic study of the pelvis revealed bilateral femur neck fracture. Since the left hip was more symptomatic, the patient underwent total hip replacement of the left hip first following which total hip replacement of the right hip was done 4 days after the first surgery. The patient started ambulating full-weight-bearing with the help of a height adjustable walker from the very next day after total hip replacement of the right hip."
