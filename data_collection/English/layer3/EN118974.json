  "text": "We present the case of an 80-year-old woman who was admitted with right upper quadrant pain initially thought to be secondary to acute cholecystitis. Subsequent ultrasound and computed tomography scans of the abdomen revealed signs suggestive of acute cholecystitis but neither modality detected any gallstones. As the patient's symptoms failed to resolve on conservative management, she was taken to theatre for an open cholecystectomy. Intra-operatively, the gallbladder had undergone complete torsion and appeared gangrenous. A routine cholecystectomy followed and she recovered from the operation without incident."
