  "text": "A 60-year-old male patient was consulted by a digestive surgeon of unaware thyroid enlargement. Physical and imaging examination showed a suspect of thyroid malignancy. During surgery, we found that a tumour had invaded the anterior side of the trachea. Resection of three tracheal rings was performed, with end-to-end anastomosis. Surgical outcome regarding nervous preservation and parathyroid glands was good as well as cosmetic aspect. During one-year follow-up, no indication of tumour recurrence was found. The management of locally invasive DTC has been controversial yielding the palliative surgery modalities. Advances in surgical technique have given a new perspective of resection in a difficult case. This case report was managed by sleeve resection with end-to-end anastomosis which showed a satisfactory outcome functionally and cosmetically."
