  "text": "A 29-year-old white man presented with a 12 months history of progressive abdominal distension. Clinical examination revealed a bulky hypogastric mass. Abdominal computed tomography and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed a large, well defined preperitoneal tumor measuring 18 x 17 cm extending in the pelvis. A computed tomography guided biopsy was performed which revealed a neurofibroma. Exploratory laparotomy showed a well encapsulated elastic soft tumor in the preperitoneal space which measured 17 x 18 cm and weighted 2 Kg. The tumor was completely excised. No recurrence occurred after one year of follow-up."
