  "text": "A 12-year-old girl presented with complaints of pain and swelling over both clavicles for 6 months duration. It was of insidious onset and it started bilaterally on the same day. It was not associated with fever. There was no history of trauma or any other swellings. On clinical examination, both clavicles were enlarged on medial half, non-tender on palpation and there was no local rise of temperature. The swellings were hard in consistency with smooth surface and margins were ill-defined. On examination, both shoulders range of motion were normal. There was no distal neurovascular deficits. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Blood investigations revealed erythrocyte sedimentation rate - 90, C-reactive protein - 0.6, total count - 8000. Rheumatoid arthritis factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, and anti-streptolysin O titer were negative. Hemoglobin electrophoresis was normal. Peripheral smear was normal. Sickling test was negative. Mantoux test and sputum acid-fast bacillus were also negative. Liver function tests and renal function tests, were within normal limits. No abnormalities were noted in ultrasonography abdomen. MRI of bilateral clavicle showed expansile lesions in bilateral clavicles -(medial aspect) possibility of CRMO. Histopathological examination showed mainly ossifying bone with foci of hemorrhage. Culture from the lesion showed no growth."
