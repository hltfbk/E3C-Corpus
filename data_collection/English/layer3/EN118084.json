  "text": "A standard clinical examination was carried out on a 34-year-old Saudi woman showing clinical features of MELAS. Fresh frozen muscle tissue was subjected to enzyme histochemical analysis. DNA was extracted from her leukocytes and muscle tissue, and the full mitochondrial genome was screened for base substitution mutations and deletions. Additionally, we screened the polymerase gamma-1 nuclear gene for mutations. The patient was negative for the most common m.3243 A>G MELAS mutation. Sequencing the full mitochondrial genome did not reveal any known or potentially pathogenic sequence changes. The polymerase gamma-1 gene was also free from mutations."
