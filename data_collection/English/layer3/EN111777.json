  "text": "A 6-year-old previously healthy boy from Sri Lanka presented with high grade fever, headache, photophobia and left eye pain for 10 days and diplopia for 2 days duration. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for left sided abducens nerve palsy. He had high inflammatory markers and white blood cell count. A tentative differential diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis complicated by cerebral oedema, acute hydrocephalus or cerebral abscess was made. However, non-contrast CT brain, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and electroencephalogram were normal leading to a diagnostic dilemma. MRI brain with contrast performed 3 days later due to limited resources revealed left mastoiditis extending to petrous temporal bone confirming Gradenigo syndrome."
