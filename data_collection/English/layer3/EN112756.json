  "text": "A 65-year-old Caucasian male, with a remote history of gout and surgical intervention for symptomatic Osgood-Schlatter disease, suffered sudden hyperflexion with eccentric contraction of the right knee while hiking. The patient presented with massive right knee effusion and significant tenderness over the tibial tubercle, with an inability to extend the knee. After radiographs were inconclusive, magnetic resonance imaging was performed showing a tear of the medial aspect of the distal patellar tendon."
