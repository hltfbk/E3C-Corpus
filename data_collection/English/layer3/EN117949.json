  "text": "We review a case of a 38-year-old woman with a right-sided Bochdalek hernia who was experiencing abdominal pain and pleural effusion. The diagnosis of Bochdalek hernia was made by chest X-ray and computed tomography. The right lobe of the liver and flexura hepatica of the colon were herniated into the thorax cavity. The hernia was treated via thoracotomy assisted with laparoscopy and she made an uneventful recovery."
