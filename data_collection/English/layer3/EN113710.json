  "text": "We describe the unusual case of a one-year-old child affected by short bowel syndrome and history of severe cow's milk allergy (CMA) and anaphylactic reaction due to intravenous administration of methyl-prednisolone sodium succinate (Solu-Medrol 40 mg, Pfizer). He was admitted to our hospital for severe respiratory failure and was initially treated with methyl-prednisolone (Urbason 40 mg, Sanofi Aventis), then with methyl-prednisolone sodium succinate (Solu-Medrol 40 mg, Pfizer). After the intravenous administration of second steroid, immediate anaphylaxis was recorded and treatment was stopped. Antihistamine and epinephrine were required and symptom resolution occurred."
