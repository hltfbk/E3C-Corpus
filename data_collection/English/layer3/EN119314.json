  "text": "Here we present the case of a 64 year old woman with a 9 month history of haematuria, frequency, urinary incontinence and weight loss. Cystoscopy revealed a solid tumour throughout the whole bladder wall and a vesico-vaginal fistula. This was confirmed on CT scan which also showed no other organ involvement and bilateral hydronephrosis. Trans urethral biopsies taken at cystoscopy revealed Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The patient had a nephrostomy inserted and is currently receiving a course of chemotherapy."
