  "text": "A 75-year-old female patient with a past medical history of hypertension and cerebral infarction paid a hospital visit as a result of right upper quadrant abdominal pain and anorexia for two months. Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 43790/μL, which was then increased up to 77050/μL. In addition, the results of bone marrow examination suggested a leukemoid reaction. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a focal hepatic mass, which was confirmed through pathological examination to be an SHC postoperatively. In addition, the WBC count had fallen to a normal level before she left the hospital. However, the patient died two and a half months after the second hospital admission."
