  "text": "A 1-month-old Chinese baby girl presented with projectile vomiting and hyperpyrexia for 3 days. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study showed incomplete duodenal obstruction; however, ultrasonography revealed congenital membranous jejunal stenosis associated with a gastric duplication cyst. After surgical excision of the jejunal membrane and gastric duplication cyst, she recovered well with no bilious vomiting at the 1-year follow-up."
