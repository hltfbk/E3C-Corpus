  "text": "Patient N. M. S was a nine week old female infant who presented with a history of a swelling in the left forearm since birth and a 6 week history of fever. The swelling on the left forearm was about the size of a coin at birth and gradually increased in size. At the age of 3 weeks, she was taken to a private hospital where the swelling thought to be a boil was incised and a yellow fluid which was believed to be pus was drained. The swelling thereafter rapidly increased in size with poor wound healing resulting in a large ulcer over the area. There was associated pain as the child was said to cry whenever the swelling was touched. This was said to be after the incision and drainage. There was also limitation of movement at the elbow joint as the swelling spread to involve the elbow joint. A few days after the incision of the swelling, which was 6 weeks before presentation the child developed a low grade intermittent fever which was temporarily relieved by paracetamol. Various herbal preparations were applied to the swelling along with oral administration of over the counter drugs with no improvement. Mother did not book for antenatal care though pregnancy was said to be uneventful with no history of early rash with fever or exposure to irradiation. Mother took herbal preparations for about a month from the 7 th month of gestation. She did not take any other known drugs. She delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery at term at a traditional birth attendant's home. Physical examination revealed an infant who was mildly pale, afebrile (T=37Â°C), anicteric, not cyanosed, and had a left axillary lymphadenopathy measuring 1cm in diameter, firm, mobile and non tender. Examination of the musculoskeletal system showed a large swelling on the left forearm involving the elbow and upper part of the arm, the overlying skin was hyperaemic and had dilated veins. The swelling which measured 12cm by 10cm was firm, tender with some fluctuant areas. An ulcer measuring 5cm by 8cm was seen on the medial aspect of the extensor surface of the forearm. The edge was raised, the base indurated and the floor had dirty slough. Other systems were essentially normal. An initial diagnosis of soft tissue tumour probably Rhabdomyosarcoma was made. An initial full blood count done was suggestive of sepsis for which the patient was commenced on intravenous Ceftriaxone, and Gentamicin which were irregular due to fianancial constraints. She also had daily dressing of the ulcer. A week into the admission, a wedge excisional biopsy was done and the histology report showed a small blue cell tumour with the following as possibilities; Desmoplastic small cell tumour, Ewing sarcoma, Lymphoma, and Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma. Immunohistochemistry test done at another center using membranous staining with MIC2 (12E7) antigen (CD99) gave a final diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma. An initial chest x-ray done was normal. X-ray of the left forearm showed erosion of the ulna bone. Other investigations such as wound swab microscopy and culture, blood culture and liver function tests were ordered for but were not done because of financial difficulties. A month after admission, disarticulation of the left arm with an above elbow amputation was performed, and the child was to commence adjuvant chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. However, her parents were unable to procure cytotoxic drugs due to financial constraints. On the 48 th day of admission, a swelling was noticed over the thoracolumbar spine, which was suspected to be a metastatic lesion. An X-ray of the thoracolumbar spine was requested but was never done due to financial constraints. She continued to have intermittent pyrexia despite treatment with intravenous ceftriaxzone which was later changed to ceftazidime. She also received oral antibiotics when parents could not afford intravenous drugs and antimalarials. She later developed acute watery diarrhea with mild dehydration for which she was given oral rehydration solution. She had a total of three full blood count tests done throughout her hospital stay which were suggestive of sepsis and also electrolytes and urea during the diarrhoeal episode which was essentially normal except for low bicarbonate which was corrected. The patient eventually succumbed to probable sepsis as an immediate cause of death and died after two months on admission."
