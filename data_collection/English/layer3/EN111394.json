  "text": "An eighty years old gentleman presented to A&E with confusion, severe urosepsis and acute kidney injury. CTKUB demonstrated significant right sided hydronephrosis, perinephric fat stranding and gas in collecting system. A year prior to this admission he has become known to the urology team for a fungal ball that was noted in the upper pole of the right kidney which was picked up following elective flexible ureterorenoscopy for right kidney stones. Flexible ureterorenoscopy and successful retrieval of fungal ball by basket was performed."
