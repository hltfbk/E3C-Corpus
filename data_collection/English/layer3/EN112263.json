  "text": "An 81-year-old man visited our hospital with chief complaints of fever and abdominal pain 7 years after the onset of WON due to severe necrotic pancreatitis. His medical history included an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed that the pancreatic fluid collection (PFC) had spread to the aorta with inflammation surrounding it, and CT findings suggested that bleeding occurred from the vasodilation due to splenic vein occlusion. First, we attempted to perform transpapillary drainage because of venous dilation around the residual stomach and the PFC. However, pancreatic duct drainage failed because of complete main pancreatic duct disruption. Second, we performed endoscopic ultrasound-guided drainage. After transmural drainage, the inflammation improved and stenting for the AAA was performed successfully. The inflammation was resolved, and he has been free from infection for more than 2 years after the procedure."
