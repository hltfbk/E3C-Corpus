  "text": "This study covers a novel presentation of MNC in a patient and summarizes the clinicopathological characteristics of this type of tumor by using pooled-analysis methods. Morphologically, this tumor type is a series of benign to malignant pedigrees. We establish the following criteria for the classification of micronodular thymic tumors with lymphoid stroma: (1) Tumor cells with moderate-to-severe dysplasia; (2) Tumor cell mitotic figures > 2/10 high-power fields; (3) Appearance of neoplastic necrosis; (4) No terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-positive immature T lymphocytes within the tumor; (5) Tumor cells with a Ki-67 index â‰¥ 10%; and (6) Tumor cells express CD5. Cases that fall into the borders of two categories in terms of morphology are attributed to atypical MNT. It is proposed that the diagnosis of MNT should be established on the diagnostic criteria mentioned above."
