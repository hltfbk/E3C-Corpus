She was found to have madarosis & hypopigmented, hypoaesthetic macular lesions on the upper limb & thighs. Bilateral ulnar & popliteal nerves were thickened. A skin biopsy of the lesions revealed borderline tuberculoid leprosy, slit skin smears revealed a bacteriological index of 1+. She did not have any evidence of thromboembolic episode or atherosclerosis. ACLA was positive at presentation & also on another occasion 6 weeks later. ACLAs were of the IgM type on both occasions. Lupus Anticoagulant & beta2 GPI antibody were negative. DOPPLER of the lower limb arteries did not reveal any abnormality. Patient was successfully treated with multi-drug antileprotics & anticoagulants."
