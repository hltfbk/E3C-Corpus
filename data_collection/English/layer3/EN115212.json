  "text": "We report an 8-year-old Chinese boy, who had characteristic developmental delay, ataxia and acrocephaly as the main symptoms. He also complained of paroxysmal headache and palpitation. Brain image revealed a symmetrical, extensive subcortical white matter lesion. Urine test for organic acids showed a significantly increased level of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (106.74 mmol/mol cre, normal range 0.6 ~ 5.9 mmol/mol cre), leading to the diagnosis of L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. Genetic testing uncovered two heterozygous missense mutations in L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase gene: c.169G > A in exon 2 and c.542G > T in exon 5, not hitherto been described."
