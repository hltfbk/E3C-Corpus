  "text": "A previously not recognized intronic PRRT2 mutation (c.880-35G > A; p.S294Lfs*29) was found in an 18 month old girl with IC and in her mother with classical presentation of PKD. The mutation results in a novel splice acceptor site in intron 2 of PRRT2. Due to frameshift and a subsequent premature stop-codon the resulting transcript appears to render the PRRT2 protein non/dysfunctional and is the likely cause of disease in this family."
