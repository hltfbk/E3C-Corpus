  "text": "In this case report, we describe an unusual case of a 65-year-old male who presented to the clinic with progressive decrease of vision after he underwent a revision of scleral bleb with the administration of 0.05 mL 5-FU (2.5 mg) injection and was diagnosed with corneal epithelial hyperplasia. The patient had a history of glaucoma managed by deep sclerotomy and phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation."
