  "text": "A 11-year-old girl with a more than 7 years history of restricted left knee flexion was presented. The clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were detailed here. A strip-like induration was palpated in the left thigh, which tends to be more obvious with knee flexion. MRI demonstrated a hypointensity band connected the anterior inferior iliac spine with the patella, and marked atrophy of the left RF muscle. Fibrosis contracture band was confirmed with arthroscope, then divided by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) under arthroscopic observation. Followed by debridement of the fibrillar connective tissue and hemostasis around the broken ends. The movement of left knee joint significantly improved after the operation, and the patient recovered nearly full range of motion of this joint after 6 months."
