  "text": "A young girl aged 13 months, with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, admitted to the pediatric department for management of urinary tract infection, Urine culture was isolated Escherichia coli sensitive to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. Clinical examination found a tonic child, hemodynamically, stable febrile at 38Â°C, we did not find abdominal mass or abnormalities of the external genitalia. The biological assessment showed leukocytosis at 18,000 cells/mm3, C-reactive protein at 56 mg/l; renal function was normal with serum creatinine at 6 mg/l and blood urea at 0.3g/l. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a hypertrophic right kidney against the left renal space is empty with a retrovesical cystic mass. After treatment of the infection and sterile cytobacteriological examination of urine, cystography was requested that objectified retrovesical opacity communicating with the bladder, there was also a left vesicoureteral reflux. Uro-MRI showed a cystic formation retrovesical communicating with the bladder, pelvic right kidney, and uterus is normal size for age. DMSA has confirmed the absence of the left kidney with the right kidney which ensures 100% of total renal function. Surgical exploration found after a standard Pfannenstiel laparotomy hernia of the bladder through the left broad ligament, the uterus was dislocated on the right with hypoplasic left ovary; ipsilateral ureter blind ending with a left renal agenesis, we proceeded by reduction of the hernia with a closure defect of the broad ligament. Then dissection of the ureter with ligation and its section at its bladder stoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was declared coming out of the hospital five days postoperatively; Outcome was favorable."
