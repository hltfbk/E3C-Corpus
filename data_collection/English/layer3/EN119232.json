  "text": "We report the case of a 66-year-old male patient who slipped on an icy pavement and fell on his left hip. He sustained a comminuted acetabular fracture (a transtectal T-fracture with an incomplete posterior stem through the ischial tuberosity), and was operated on five days later, via an ilio-inguinal approach. In the recovery room, his left lower limb was found to be cool and pale. Immediate re-exploration showed a left external iliac artery thrombosis, and thrombectomy was performed. In the surgical management of acetabular fractures, thrombosis of a major pelvic artery is a rare but potentially devastating complication. We discuss the possible aetiology (initial vessel trauma versus iatrogenic, intraoperative arterial injury) and pathomechanism, and wish to draw attention to this complication and to recommend ways in which it can be prevented."
