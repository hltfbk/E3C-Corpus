  "text": "A 12-year-old boy with an overweight, consulted the emergency department after a closed trauma of the right knee following a fall from its own height.\nOn examination, he has a painful and swollen knee with limited motion and there was no neurovascular abnormality.\nThe antero-posterior radiograph revealed a fracture through the medial physis extending through the epiphysis classified Salter-Harris III. However, the lateral radiograph showed angulation and anterior displacement of the epiphysis classified Salter-Harris I. Unfortunately, the CT scan was not available that day, so we decided to operate the patient in emergency. Closed reduction was achieved under general anesthesia. The stabilization of the fracture was ensured by a horizontal pinning of the epiphysis and a cross pinning fixing the epiphysis to the metaphysis. A cast immobilization of 6 weeks was necessary to avoid any secondary displacement and to ensure a good consolidation of the fracture.\nAfter the removal of the pins, a functional rehabilitation was instituted to regain a good mobility of the knee. At the last one year follow up, the patient had no growth disturbance from injury and had returned to normal activities with a good mobility of his knee."
