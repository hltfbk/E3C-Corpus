  "text": "A 60 year old woman encountered during an outreach consultation, presented with skin changes and a rash on the left leg associated with severe pruritus over a period of 8 years. She consulted with the local nurse who made a provisional diagnosis of a cutaneous mycosis; and treated her with Griseofulvin for over 4 years. Her house was situated by a slow-flowing stream. On examination, there was a papular rash around the left knee associated with excoriation marks probably due to scratching. There was hypopigmentation around the shin of her left leg (leopard skin-like changes) with associated hardening of the skin around this region. A skin snip of the left leg was obtained and prepared with normal saline. When viewed under a microscope after two hours, microfilariae were seen wriggling free on the slide. She was stopped from taking Griseofulvin; given 12mg of Ivermectin in a single dose and Loratadine. She returned 3 months later for a follow-up; with disappearance of the pruritic papular lesions."
