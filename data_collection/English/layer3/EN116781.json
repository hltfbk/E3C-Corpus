  "text": "A 64-year-old man was referred to our hospital for pollakiuria. Contrasted-enhanced computed tomography revealed a heterogeneously enhanced pelvic tumor of approximately 10 × 8 × 7 cm. Invasion of the surrounding organs, distal metastasis, and lymph node swelling were absent. Therefore, surgical resection was performed. The resected specimen was a 13 × 8 × 5.5-cm encapsulated elastic hard tumor weighing 420 g. Histologically, the tumor consisted of oval or spindle cells growing in a random manner in a collagenous matrix. Immunohistochemically, the specimen was positive for CD34, bcl-2, as well as vimentin and negative for c-kit. On the basis of these findings, a retroperitoneal solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) of the pelvis was diagnosed."
