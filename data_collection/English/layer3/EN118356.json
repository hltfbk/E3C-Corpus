  "text": "We report here a case of septic arthritis due to Ralstonia pickettii in a female diabetic patient. The microorganism was identified from the synovial fluid by molecular-based methods, while the conventional synovial and blood cultures proved to be negative. The patient was treated by intravenous ceftazidime with complete remission of her symptoms; she was discharged 3 weeks after admission in a very good health. At follow-up examination 3 weeks later, she was still in good health condition without any sign of arthritis of the right knee and afebrile."
