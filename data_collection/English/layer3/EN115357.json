  "text": "We report on the case of a 70-year-old man who was strongly suspected IgG4-DS because of high serum IgG4 concentration (215Â mg/dl) and bilateral swelling of parotid and submandibular glands. Biopsies of cervical lymph node and a portion of submandibular gland were performed. These histopathological findings subsequently confirmed a diagnosis of marginal zone B cell lymphoma."
