  "text": "A 10 years old male child right-handed, was received on May 15, 2011 in HALD Pediatric Surgery Department for the right shoulder blunt trauma, 7 hours before admission. He had been punched on the right anterior shoulder by another child, older than him. He then felt pain and developed anterior chest deformity and right upper limb relative functional impairment. The child received before admission a massage from a traditional healer without any success. On physical examination, he presented a good general status, conscience, well colored conjunctiva and a temperature of 37 Â° C. There were also a depression and a provoked pain on the right sternoclavicular joint. The mobilization of the right shoulder was painful. There were neither downstream neurovascular disorders, no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. AP chest radiography was normal. Chest CT scan showed a right SCJD in its posterior form. A closed reduction under general anesthesia had been done 12 hours after the trauma. It was obtained by traction in adduction applied on the arm in the axis of the upper limb with a direct manipulation of the clavicle medial end. The reduction was confirmed by an audible snap. The distal pulses were palpable and a figure-eight bandage was done. A control chest CT scan showed a reduction of the SCJD. The radial pulse, motor and sensitive function of the right upper limb were evaluated and the child was discharged after two days of hospitalization. The figure-eight bandage was removed after six weeks of immobilization. After a flow-up of 18 months, the right shoulder was painless and mobile in all directions."
