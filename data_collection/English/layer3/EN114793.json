  "text": "A 43-year-old man underwent right-lobe LDLT for treatment of a severe acute hepatitis B infection and was followed up with ultrasound examinations for one year. Conventional gray-scale and Doppler ultrasound combined with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) accurately revealed the occurrence of HA dissection secondary to HAP and accompanied by thrombosis and collateral circulation, as well as secondary biliary complications, which provided a prompt diagnosis and guidance for the treatment."
