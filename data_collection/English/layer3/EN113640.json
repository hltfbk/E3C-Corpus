  "text": "The patient was a 1-year-old girl with epigastric incisional hernia after an operation to correct a complete arteriovenous septal defect. The fascial defect (size 30 × 35 mm) was large; thus, direct suturing was considered to be associated with a high risk of thoracic deformation and recurrence. Laparoscopic IPOM was performed. The fascial defect was detected precisely through the laparoscopy, and non-absorbable mesh was placed through a 12-mm trocar. Minimal incisions were required for the trocars, and extensive dissection of the abdominal wall structure was not needed. This procedure allowed for the integrity and functional status of the abdominal wall to be maintained."
