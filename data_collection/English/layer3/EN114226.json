  "text": "A postmenopausal female of rheumatoid arthritis aged 56 years, presented to our emergency department with a history of trivial fall at home. Following the fall, she was unable to bear weight on bilateral feet and complained of deformity. History revealed consumption of bisphosphonates (tablet alendronate 10 mg) for the last 4 years and glucocorticoids for rheumatiod arthritis. Radiographs were taken, which revealed bilateral pathological subtrochanteric fracture femurii. After obtaining necessary fitness, the patient was taken up for surgery. Closed reduction and Internal fixation with long proximal femoral nail were done. Bisphosphonate intake was stopped and teriparatide 20 Âµg/day subcutaneously given for 3 months. Fracture healed after 3 months and patient resumed her daily activities."
