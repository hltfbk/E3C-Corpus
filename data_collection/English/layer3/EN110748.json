  "text": "A 50-year-old Caucasian female with a history of Evans syndrome (idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia) and hypogammaglobulinaemia initially presented to the neurology clinic with marked cerebellar ataxia and headaches. Following extensive investigation (which included brain biopsy), she was diagnosed with neuro-sarcoidosis and her symptoms resolved following treatment with immunosuppressive therapy. Over the following 10 years, she was extensively investigated for recurrent pulmonary infections and abnormal radiological findings, which included pulmonary nodules, infiltrates and splenomegaly. Subsequently, she was referred to an immunology clinic, where immunoglobulin replacement treatment was started for what was ultimately considered to be CVID. Shortly afterwards, evaluation of her clinical, radiological and histological findings at a specialist interstitial lung disease clinic led to a diagnosis of GLILD."
