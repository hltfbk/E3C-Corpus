  "text": "A 48-year-old woman who had left pneumonectomy 2â€‰years ago was scheduled to have the right anterior segmentectomy through uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS). A 32-French (Fr) left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) was chosen and adapted. The DLT was intubated into the bronchus intermedius. And the upper lobe can be isolated from the ventilation in the middle and lower lobes when the bronchial cuff's inflated. The perioperative period was uneventful and the pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma."
