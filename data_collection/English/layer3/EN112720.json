  "text": "After administration of posaconazole oral suspension, the patient developed severe hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE -Grade 3) with a serum total bilirubin (T-BIL) peak level of 170 Î¼mol/L, alkaline phosphatase level of 739 U/L, alanine aminotransferase level of 99 U/L, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase level of 638 U/L. After posaconazole withdrawal and symptomatic treatment with liver-protective agents, the level of T-BIL and other laboratory data decreased gradually, and related symptoms disappeared. After medication analysis and literature review, we consider that the patient had a cholestatic type of posaconazole-induced liver injury, which was related to intracellular mitochondrial DNA damage. The case demonstrates that when patients with hematological malignancy develop severe infection following chemotherapy, combination of anti-infective drugs may contribute to a higher risk of severe drug-induced liver injury."
