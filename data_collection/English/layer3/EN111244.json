  "text": "We report a 40-year-old male patient who presented with 1 week history of diffuse abdominal pain and high grade fever, associated with vomiting and frequent loose stools. Has history of chronic alcohol ingestion. Otherwise, no past history of chronic medical illness, nor he had contact with individuals with similar illness. He was in a septic shock with multiple organ failure up on presentation to emergency room. Physical examination revealed icterus sclera with abdominal tenderness. He was immediately resuscitated using crystalloids, supported with inotrope, and antibiotics. Histopathological examination of tissue sample from colonic ulcer biopsy revealed invasive intestinal mucormycosis. Patient showed full clinical and histopathological resolution after course of parenteral Liposomal Amphotercin B."
