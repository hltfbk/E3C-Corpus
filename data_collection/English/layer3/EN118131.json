  "text": "We present an 84-year old male patient with concomitant early in-stent restenosis after coronary artery stent placement, myocardial infarction, left and right ventricular thrombi and aortic valve stenosis. Diagnoses were made on emergency cardiac computed tomography. All findings were confirmed by catheter coronary angiography, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonce imaging."
