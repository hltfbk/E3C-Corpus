  "text": "3 months old identical twins born to a 5th degree consanguinous couple were brought with complaints of excessive cry, deformity of all four limbs, recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea since birth. Evaluation of both the probands revealed facial dysmorphism with perinasal nodules, gingival hypertrophy, fixed deformities of multiple joints bilaterally, umbilical hernia, fleshy perianal nodules and pigmented patches over knuckles and ankle. A clinical diagnosis of ISH was suspected and confirmed by detection of homozygous c.277_278insATTATTT (or p.L93Yfs*14) in exon 3 of the ANTXR2 gene. The probands were managed symptomatically and parents were counselled regarding prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies."
