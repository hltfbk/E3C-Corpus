  "text": "The first patient, a 22-year-old woman, was diagnosed with rectovaginal fistula and rectal stenosis due to perianal Crohn's disease 2Â years earlier. Induction therapy with infliximab and endoscopic balloon dilatation did not improve her symptoms. The second patient, a 33-year-old woman, was also diagnosed with rectovaginal fistula and rectal stenosis due to perianal Crohn's disease, and medical treatment was also unsuccessful. Both patients underwent dual-port laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection using a multichannel port, with no perioperative and postoperative complications."
