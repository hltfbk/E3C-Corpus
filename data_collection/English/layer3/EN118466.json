  "text": "We herein report two cases of leiomyosarcoma of the IVC with successful en bloc resection and individualized caval reconstruction. One patient presented with a large intramural and intraluminal mass and received a complete circumferential resection. Reconstruction was performed by graft replacement of the caval segment affected. The other patient displayed a predominantly extraluminal tumor growth and underwent semicircumferential resection of the IVC including the confluence of the left renal vein. In this case vascular reconstruction was performed by cavoplasty and reinsertion of the left renal vein into the proximal portion of the IVC. Resection margins of both patients were tumor free and no clinical signs of venous insufficiency of the lower extremity occurred."
