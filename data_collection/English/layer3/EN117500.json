  "text": "We describe the case of a Caucasian British woman who presented at the age of 53 years with a hepatic mass, malignant lymphadenopathy and pulmonary metastases, which were confirmed as hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma on biopsy. After unproductive treatment with interferon, our patient was started on thalidomide 400 mg daily. She has been successfully managed on this therapy for the past seven years, and has remained asymptomatic, with radiologically stable disease and minimal treatment-related side effects."
