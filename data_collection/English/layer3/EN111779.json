  "text": "We report a case of acute kidney injury in a patient with melanoma treated by ipilimumab. Kidney biopsy revealed acute interlobular and juxtaglomerular granulomatous arteritis, which has not yet been reported in patients treated by ICPIs. Kidney function partially recovered after ipilimumab discontinuation and oral prednisone. Unfortunately, the patient died a few months later from progression of his melanoma."
