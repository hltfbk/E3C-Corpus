  "text": "The case described is that of a 55 year old woman who presented with a neck swelling and features of hyperthyroidism, with biochemical parameters in keeping with T4 toxicosis. Investigating the patient necessitated a fine needle aspiration of the thyroid swelling. The patient thereafter developed hyper-metabolic features, and subsequently progressed to confusion and loss of consciousness few hours following the procedure. Close monitoring and medical management with anti-thyroid and other supportive therapies, resulted in an improved clinical condition."
