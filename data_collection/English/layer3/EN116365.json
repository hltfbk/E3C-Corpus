  "text": "A 67-year-old Korean man, who had been diagnosed with EKC and treated for conjunctival injection and chemosis in the right eye for 4 days, was referred to Oculoplastics as orbital cellulitis was suspected. At the point of referral, clinical features such as decreased visual acuity, severe eyelid swelling, chemosis, follicles, corneal edema, limitations in lateral eye movement, and diplopia were observed in the right eye. Orbital cellulitis was suspected according to orbital computed tomography scan images, but there was no response to systemic antibiotics. Systemic steroid was administered instead, and then his symptoms and signs started to improve. The final diagnosis of this patient was orbital inflammation related to EKC based on the facts that there was no response to antibiotics, that he presented with contralateral symptoms and signs, that pseudomembrane formation occurred in both eyes, and that the symptoms resolved completely after 2 weeks."
