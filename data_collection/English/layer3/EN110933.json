  "text": "A 48-year-old Japanese woman fell down stairs that had a height of approximately 4 m. An X-ray showed pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion in her right lung, and an unstable pelvic fracture. A chest drain was inserted and preperitoneal pelvic packing was performed to control bleeding, performing resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta. A computed tomography scan revealed massive lung contusion in the lower lobe of her right lung, pelvic fractures, and multiple fractures and hematoma in other areas. An emergency thoracotomy was performed, and then we performed wide wedge resection of the injured lung, clamping proximal to suture lines with two Satinsky blood vessel clamps. The vessel clamps were left in the right thoracic cavity. The other hemorrhagic areas were embolized by transcatheter arterial embolization. However, since her respiratory functions deteriorated in the intensive care unit, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used for lung assist. Planned reoperation under veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was performed on day 2. Since her respiratory condition improved gradually, the veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit was withdrawn on day 7. She was transferred to the psychiatric ward of our hospital on day 75."
