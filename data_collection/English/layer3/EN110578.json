  "text": "Patient information On the 20 th August 2020, a previously healthy, 17-year-old African male was transferred from a local hospital to the medical admission ward at Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital (CHBAH), Soweto, Johannesburg. The patient presented with a one week history of fever, generalized rash over the body and eyelids, intermittent headache with associated neck pain, sore throat and a dry cough, preceded by a day history of diarrhoea. There was no history of arthralgias, oral or nasal ulcers, or urethral discharge. There was no prior medical admission, no history of surgery and no significant medication or recreational drug use. He is currently a grade ten scholar. There was no known COVID-19 case contact, however recent travel to Kwa-Zulu Natal two weeks prior was noted (Table 1). Clinical findings On clinical examination the patient was ill looking with a blood pressure of 103/44 mmHg, heart rate of 123 beats per minute and a temperature of 39.5Â°C. He was restless with no evidence of cognitive dysfunction. A generalized maculopapular rash was observed over the torso, upper back, limbs and palmar surface of the hands. The rash was non-tender, with erythematous desquamating lesions over the eyelids and bilateral conjunctivitis. The abdominal and respiratory examinations were normal with no jaundice, or lymphadenopathy. His cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds with no added sounds, a sinus tachycardia, a normal volume pulse and warm, well perfused peripheries. He had no meningism and there was no arthritis. Diagnostic assessment Diagnostic methods Prior to arrival to CHBAH the patient had received three days of ceftriaxone and intravenous (IV) paracetamol with no clinical improvement. Blood investigations showed a rising C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white cell count (WCC), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and D-dimers (Table 2). Blood and urine cultures remained negative. The lumbar puncture was normal (including viral panel) with a normal chest radiograph and abdominal sonar. The first echocardiogram (ECHO) performed revealed a structurally normal heart with normal systolic function. Three nasopharyngeal swabs sent for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were negative. Diagnosis and differentials An initial wide differential diagnosis of infections was considered: viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion, acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) or cytomegalovirus (CMV); and bacterial infections caused by Group A streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, other gram negative bacteria, rickettsia, leptospirosis or malaria. Non-infectious differential diagnoses were also considered: Kawasaki like disease (KD) as well as adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) were considered in view of the rash, sore throat, elevated ferritin, CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in association with neutrophilia. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was considered on account of fever, rash and low complement (C3, C4) levels. An elevated temperature, rising CRP, PCT, LDH, D-Dimer and ferritin levels with deranged liver function tests (LFT), suggested a diagnosis of MIS-C. Therapeutic intervention On admission, the patient was tachycardic with a mean arterial pressure of 64mmHg, with no clinical or biochemical indicators of end organ hypoperfusion. Intravenous fluid boluses of crystalloid were administered with no significant response in haemodynamic parameters. Fluid boluses were ceased and urine output and serum lactate levels were monitored as markers of tissue hypoperfusion. Inotropes and vasopressors were not initiated as part of initial management. Doxycycline was added as empiric cover for rickettsial disease and ceftriaxone was continued on day two. Hydrocortisone was commenced on admission but discontinued on day three due to concern for infection. A transient resolution of the fever coincided with steroid initiation, and a subsequent elevation in temperature was noted when the steroids were interrupted. On day four of admission, in light of an audible gallop rhythm, persistently low mean arterial pressures and newly elevated cardiac troponin-T levels, a repeat ECHO was performed, revealing an ejection fraction (EF) of 10% with global hypokinesia, four chamber dilation, moderate functional tricuspid and mitral regurgitation with a sliver of pericardial effusion. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was started at a total dose of 120g (2g/kg) over 72 hours in conjunction with a dobutamine infusion and gentle diuresis to counter fluid overload. An IV methylprednisolone pulse of 500mg daily for three days was initiated with the IVIG on day five of admission. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and confirmed the presence of immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein with in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing. A bone marrow aspirate and trephine (BMAT) revealed increased macrophage activity, but did not meet criteria for macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Doxycycline and ceftriaxone were discontinued after four and seven days, respectively. Colchicine was added to cover for possible associated myopericarditis. Defervescence was noted on day six, accompanied by a downward trend in inflammatory markers, LDH and ferritin. Aspirin (300mg daily) and a therapeutic dose of enoxaparin (60mg twice daily) were added in view of thrombotic risk. The patient improved clinically with no further temperature spikes and repeat ECHO revealed an improved EF of 45% on day seven. Inotropic support was weaned off on day seven. Prednisone 30mg daily was initiated on day eight after completion of methylprednisolone pulse. The patient was monitored for a further two days, and showed clinical improvement, with no further temperature spikes and/ or hypotensive episodes. There was almost complete resolution of the initial rash. His WCC, CRP, PCT, LDH, D-dimers and ferritin were all on a downward trend and the LFT had normalized. The patient was discharged on day 12 on prednisone 20mg daily, aspirin 100mg daily, and colchicine 0,5mg twice daily (Table 1). Follow up and outcomes Mr. LN was reviewed 2 weeks later in the rheumatology outpatient clinic and was noted to have recovered fully with no residual symptoms. On examination there was complete resolution of the rash, with only few areas of residual hyperpigmentation. He had no tachycardia or signs of heart failure. A repeat ECHO showed an improvement in EF to 57%, without a pericardial effusion. The prednisone was weaned to 10mg daily and tapered down over the next four weeks. The treatment was well tolerated with no side effects noted. The patient returned to school and will be reviewed in the coming months. Informed consent Informed consent was obtained from the patient to use historical and clinical information as well as images avoiding identifiable features."
