  "text": "In this report, we described a 22-year-old white man who presented with an external auditory slow growing mass. A computed tomography scan of the temporal bone demonstrated a well-circumscribed, soft tissue mass narrowing most of the external auditory canal. A surgical biopsy was performed and the histological examination showed a schwannoma with chondroid metaplasia."
