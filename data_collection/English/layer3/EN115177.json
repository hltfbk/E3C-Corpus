  "text": "A 75-years-old man had a sutureless intrascleral fixation (Y-fixation) of an IOL 4 months before our examination. The nasal haptic became exposed and the temporal haptic was seen in the subconjunctiva. The tilted IOL was removed and replaced by a posterior chamber IOL that was sutured to the sclera. At the 6 months examination, the eye was quiet and the IOL was stable."
