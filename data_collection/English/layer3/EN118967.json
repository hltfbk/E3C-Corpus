  "text": "A 15-year-old, previously healthy girl presented with a 2-day history of headache and meningeal stiffness and pyrexia. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed high-intensity signals in the splenium of the corpus callosum on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images. On day 4 of admission, the level of consciousness decreased and ataxic respiration and apnea appeared. After that, fever (body temperature >40 degrees C) developed with remarkable tachycardia. The body temperature was decreased with the use of a forced-air-cooling blanket and head cooling. The core temperature, measured in the bladder, was maintained at between 36 and 37 degrees C for 5 days. During the period of normothermia, thiopental sodium was given continuously for 3 days. After normothermia, the level of consciousness increased without the development of fever, and ventilatory support was withdrawn."
