  "text": "An 8-year-old Caucasian boy affected by autism presented with nontraumatic knee pain. His parents, observing child's gait, reported recurrent limp while walking, sometimes accompanied by knee locking. Clinical examination was hindered by the noncompliance of the patient and revealed painful limitation of terminal flexion and extension. MRI scans showed a large ganglion cyst located in the intercondylar notch. Arthroscopy confirmed an intrasubstance PCL ganglion cyst, extending both anteriorly and posteriorly. Complete excision of the cyst was performed, with full recovery of the child and no recurrence."
