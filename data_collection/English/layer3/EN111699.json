  "text": "We describe a fourteen-year-old boy who presented at two and a half years of age with recurrent febrile episodes. Over the course of the disease, the episodes increased in frequency and severity, with new signs and symptoms continuing to appear. Most importantly, these included skin changes, splenomegaly and transaminitis. Only partial control of the disease was achieved with anti-IL-1 therapy. Extensive investigation showed generalized inflammation without immune deficiency, with increased levels of serum amyloid A and several pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ, as well as an increased type I interferon score. Exome sequence analysis identified P369S and R408Q variants in the MEFV innate immunity regulator, pyrin (MEFV) gene and T260 M and T320 M variants in the NLR family pyrin domain containing 12 (NLRP12) gene."
