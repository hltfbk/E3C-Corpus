  "text": "The authors present an unusual case of pedunculated subserosal leiomyosarcoma of the uterus mimicking ovarian carcinoma. A 57-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with progressive low abdominal pain and urinary frequency. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large adnexal mass with carcinomatosis peritonei. Laboratory examination revealed an elevated serum CA-125 level (398.4 U/ml). The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy under suspicion of ovarian malignancy. Frozen section indicated malignancy originating from the uterus, and thus, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, and mass excision were performed. Subsequent histopathologic examination resulted in a final diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma of the uterus. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and gemcitabine and docetaxel adjuvant chemotherapy was administered."
