  "text": "A 63-year-old male presented with nephrotic syndrome and elevated serum creatinine levels. Laboratory examination revealed elevated levels of serum IgM and low C3 levels. Serum and urine immunofixation electrophoresis showed a monoclonal IgM with a kappa light chain. A bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 5 % bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and a renal biopsy revealed mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis on light microscopy. Immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining indicated granular deposits of immunoglobulin G in the mesangium and granular deposits of immunoglobulin M and κ light chains along the capillary wall. Electron microscopy revealed randomly arranged nonbranching fibrils of approximately 15 nm in diameter in the glomerular mesangium and subendothelial electron-dense deposits. According to these results, we confirmed FGN and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, which were attributed to monoclonal IgM deposits."
