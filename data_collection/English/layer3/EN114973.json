  "text": "We describe a girl with NF1 associated with early central precocious puberty appearing at 2.5 years of age and optic glioma affecting the optic chiasm as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Genetic analysis confirmed the presence of R681X. Therapy with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist was instituted with good response to therapy. The lesions on MRI were stable and no significant vision impairment was present during the 6 years of follow-up."
