  "text": "We report a case of a 70 year old patient with a remote history of invasive breast cancer (treated twelve years earlier by lumpectomy, axillary lymph node dissection, postoperative radiation therapy, and five years of tamoxifen) who developed fibromatosis within another quadrant of the same breast that clinically, mammographically, and sonographically mimicked that of the development of an ipsilateral metachronous breast cancer. After the initial diagnosis of fibromatosis was made on a minimally invasive ultrasound guided biopsy, it was successfully treated by wide local excision."
