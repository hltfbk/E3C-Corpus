  "text": "We report the case of a 3 year 5 month old child diagnosed with HIV who developed TEN 8 days after starting a Nevirapine based HAART regimen. Drug withdrawal and supportive treatment alone were the modalities employed to achieve complete re-epithelization of lesions. Patient was lost to follow-up 6 months after being in care and was only seen 3 years later with total loss of vision."
