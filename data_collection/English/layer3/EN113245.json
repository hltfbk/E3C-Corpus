  "text": "We report here the first case of a thoracic and cutaneous sarcoid-like reaction in a patient with a relapsing unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 mAb. The expression of PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, was assessed by flow cytometry on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and compared to patients who had discontinued nivolumab therapy without having developed any immune related adverse events. PD-L1 expression was transiently increased on B cells, T cells and monocytes, whereas PD-L2 expression was not modulated. PD-1 was transiently undetectable when PD-L1 was maximal, before returning to basal level. Sarcoidosis spontaneously resolved, without corticotherapy."
