  "text": "We report the case of a 20-year-old white woman who presented with sudden onset of severe lower abdominal pain and nausea. Similar episodes of pain were experienced in the previous few months and diagnosed as a case of bilateral ovarian cyst. She was found to have a bilateral ovarian torsion caused by adnexal mass. She was treated by laparoscopic detorsion, left salpingo-oophorectomy, and right cystectomy."
