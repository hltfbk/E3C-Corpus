  "text": "A 69-year-old Caucasian man with imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia achieved complete molecular remission in response to dasatinib therapy. However, from a normal initial serum creatine kinase level, he developed elevated serum creatine kinase levels and gradual-onset progressive muscle weakness after dasatinib therapy was initiated. Our patient was eventually diagnosed with inclusion body myositis. However, we were unable to determine the mechanism underlying the dasatinib-associated muscle weakness. Given the efficacy of dasatinib in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and our patient's mild symptoms of inclusion body myositis, he continued to receive dasatinib under close clinical and laboratory observation."
