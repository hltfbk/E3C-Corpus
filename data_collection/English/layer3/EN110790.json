  "text": "A total of 191 patients underwent surgery for left colon cancer (transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon cancer) at our hospital from January 2012 to December 2017. During the procedures, the left colic artery (LCA) or sigmoid colic artery (SA) was dissected, the superior rectal artery (SRA) was preserved, and the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) was dissected at the inferior margin of the pancreas. Congestive ischemic colitis due to venous return dysfunction occurred in 4 cases (2.1%), 5 to 34â€‰months postoperatively. The patients had diarrhea and blood in the stool. On computed tomography (CT), the patients exhibited continuous intestinal edema and high-density adipose tissue from the anastomosis site to the rectum. Contrast enhancement showed dilation of the vasa recti and arteries from the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) to the SRA. Three patients improved with long-term intestinal rest; in 1 case, the stenosis did not improve and required colorectal resection."
