  "text": "A 51-year-old female underwent hemodialysis through a tunnelled double lumen catheter and had her arterio-venous graft matured. During retrieval of tunnelled double lumen catheter procedure, the distal part of the catheter was fractured and slipped into the internal jugular vein. Chest radiograph revealed intravascular double lumen catheter extending from the distal part of the right internal jugular vein to right atrium. The procedure of foreign body retrieval was done the next day under general anaesthesia and C-Arm guidance using right internal jugular venous cut-down approach. A right-angle clamp was used to retrieve the fragment without any post-procedure complications."
