  "text": "We present a case of post-traumatic anterior atlantoaxial dislocation or spondyloptosis associated with a Type 2 odontoid fracture in an adult patient who presented to us 3 months after injury. After failed attempts of closed reduction with traction, open reduction and posterior instrumentation with fusion were done using joint remodeling technique. 6-month follow-up showed completely reduced facet joints with near complete fusion."
