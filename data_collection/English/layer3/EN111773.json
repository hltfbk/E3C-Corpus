  "text": "A six-week-old female infant with Incontinentia Pigmenti developed a foudroyant necrotizing enterocolitis shortly after intravitreal injection of bevazicumab due to a retinopathy with impending tractional detachment of the left eye. Since the onset of abdominal symptoms occurred immediately after the intravitreal application, a link between the two events seemed likely. Sequential analyses of the VEGF serum concentrations showed a massive suppression of endogenous VEGF with only a very slow recovery over weeks. Such a severe systemic adverse event has not been reported after intravitreal treatment with bevacizumab in an infant."
