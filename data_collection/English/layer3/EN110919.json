  "text": "This article presents the case of a 48-year-old Caucasian pregnant woman who presented a non-traumatic left hip pain. After the exclusion of infectious and tumoral diseases, a diagnosis of a less probable transient idiopathic osteoporosis was suspected. Magnetic resonance imaging images after childbirth supported this diagnosis. She recovered clinically and imagiologically with no complications 2 years after delivery."
