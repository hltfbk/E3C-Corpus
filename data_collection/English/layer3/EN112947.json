  "text": "A 42-year-old outpatient woman without previous significant gastrointestinal diseases, was referred with dyspeptic symptoms, fatigue and mild diarrhea from 4 months. Her first investigations including immunoglobulin A (IgA) anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (anti-tTG) and stool parasitological and cultural analysis were negative. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) showed no mucosal alteration. But histology demonstrated a Helicobacter Pylori (HP) pan-gastritis while duodenal mucosa showed villous atrophy consistent with a diagnosis of CD Marsh type 3b. While on gluten-free diet (GFD) the patient didn't experience any improvement of symptoms. Duodenal biopsies were then reviewed showing the presence of trophozoites of Giardia on the luminal surface of the duodenal wall and at the same time, a second stool examination revealed the presence of trophozoites and cysts of Giardia. Treated with metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 6 days the patient reduced diarrhea after few days. After about 2 months of GFD she was invited to discontinue it. At the same time stool examination was repeated with negative results. She subsequently performed eradication for Hp with triple therapy (Pylera®). Around 6 months later, the patient did not complain any gastrointestinal symptoms. Serological tests were normal and at a follow-up EGDS, duodenal mucosa had normal histology with normal finger-like villi and absence of Giardia trophozoites."
