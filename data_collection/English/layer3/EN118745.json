  "text": "A 24-year-old woman had severe OHSS as a complication of gonadotropin stimulation. The clinical picture showed enlarged ovaries, massive ascites, pleural effusion, abdominal pain, and dyspnea. Beside the medical treatment, abdominal paracentesis for the drainage of the massive ascites and tube thoracostomy were performed, resulting in expansion of the lung."
