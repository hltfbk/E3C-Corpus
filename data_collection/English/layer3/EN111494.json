  "text": "A 37 years old woman presented with 4-year history of walking difficulties. On neurological examination, she had signs of upper motor lesion in lower extremities. She denied sphincter dysfunction and her cognition was normal. Her family history was positive for individuals with gait problems. The initial diagnosis was familial spastic paraplegia. Genetic testing identified a novel mutation in SPAST gene. All available family members were examined and had genetic testing. The same mutation in SPAST gene was identified in other affected family members. All patients caring the mutation presented with different phenotypes."
