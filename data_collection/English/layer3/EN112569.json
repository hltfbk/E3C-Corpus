  "text": "Here we report three cases of IVL treated with different surgical approaches. All patients presented with circulation symptoms. Two patients had lower extremity edema and the other had cardiopalmus. The diagnosis of IVL was confirmed based on the imagining examinations and pathological findings. All patients underwent surgical treatment and were discharged without any complications."
