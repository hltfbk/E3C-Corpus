  "text": "We report three cases of safe use of allopurinol in pregnancy for women with inflammatory bowel disease. This included 2 patients with ulcerative colitis and 1 patient with fistulising Crohn's disease. Allopurinol was used throughout pregnancy in all patients. All 3 pregnancies resulted in normal healthy babies born at term by Caesarean section."
