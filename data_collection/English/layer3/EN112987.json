  "text": "We report a case of the unilateral renal vein and inferior vena cava thrombosis, presented with gross hematuria and thrombocytopenia in a neonate. The neonate was a macrosomic male born to a mother with hyperglycemia in pregnancy. The baby was born with perinatal asphyxia and early neonatal infection and massive hematuria. Clinical and laboratory examination showed enlarged kidney having corticomedullary differentiation diminished and azotemia. Diagnosis of renal vein thrombosis was suspected by renal ultrasound and confirmed by magnetic urography. Prothrombotic risk factors were evaluated. The child is being managed conservatively. Measures aimed at the prevention of end-stage renal disease because of its poor outcome were highlighted. Despite anticoagulant therapy, the right kidney developed areas of scarring and then atrophy."
