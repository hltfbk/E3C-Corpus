  "text": "A man aged 64 years presented to the emergency department with bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture. Surgical repair was performed with suture anchors and a stainless steel cable. His legs were immobilized in casts for six weeks. After removal of the casts, physiotherapy was started. Four months after surgery, he was able to walk with 0°-120° range of motion and active extension. He was followed up for 8 years without rerupture or other complications."
