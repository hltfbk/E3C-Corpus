  "text": "This article presents a case of osteochondroma on superior angle of scapula in a 23-year-old male presented with pseudo winging and snapping of scapula, crepitus on scapulothoracic motion and occasional pain since 5 years. However, there was no increase in size of the swelling or local and systemic signs of malignant transformation. X-ray demonstrated a pedunculated exophytic mass on supero medial aspect of the right scapula. The findings were confirmed on CT and excision of the lesion was done. The patient demonstrated full painless range of motion after 1 month and no recurrence was demonstrated during 1 year follow up."
