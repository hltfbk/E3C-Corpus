  "text": "A 40-year-old man visited to Africa, developed a skin rash over ankle after an insect bite. This was followed by high grade fever. He was investigated in Kenya, however, returned to India pending results. Later he developed sleepiness and coarse tremors. Work up for the cause of fever was inconclusive. He was diagnosed with trypanosomiasis based on reports from Kenya. In absence of alternate diagnosis and clinical setting, we treated him for trypanosomiasis. This therapy resulted no improvement in patient's condition. Finally, at request of the patient's attendants he was referred to Belgium where he was diagnosed as brucellosis and treated successfully."
