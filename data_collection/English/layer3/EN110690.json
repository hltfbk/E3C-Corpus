  "text": "We conducted a translational study of 3D ICE with wide azimuthal elevation to guide implantation of a left ventricular assist device (Impella CPÂ®) in eight adult sheep. A large-bore 14 Fr central venous sheath was used to enable right atrial and right ventricular access for the intracardiac catheter. Insertion of the 3D ICE catheter was accompanied by a sudden severe cardiorespiratory deterioration in one animal. 3D ICE revealed a large highly mobile mass within the right heart chambers, determined to be a clot-in-transit. The diagnosis of pulmonary clot embolism resulting from the retrograde blood entry into the large-bore sheath introducer, rapid clot formation and consequent displacement into venous circulation by the ICE catheter was made. The sheep survived this life-threatening event following institution of cardiovascular support allowing completion of the primary research protocol."
