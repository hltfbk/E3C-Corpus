  "text": "Here we report a neovascular glaucoma patient who experienced a substantial increase in IOP associated with severe eye pain and blurred vision during sessions of dialysis. The patient had been refractory to several antiglaucoma drugs and improved after intravenous administration of 20% hyperosmotic glucose solution with dialysis and pan-retinal photocoagulation."
