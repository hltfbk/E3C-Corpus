  "text": "A 58-year-old smoker male without past medical history was referred to our hospital with over three months' right chest and para-sternal pain. Physical examination found a performance status at 2, a dyspnea, a cough with hemoptisis, and painful right chest and para-sternal mass without fever or weight loss. The chest x ray revealed the presence of a right pulmonary opacity and chest computed tomography a large parietal mass of the 4th costal arch of 95 X 45 mm with lysed appearence of the manubrium and sternal body, and a pathological fracture of the 5th right rib. A transmural ultrasound biopsy of the mass allowed the detection of a malignant undifferentiated tumour growth with a strong positivity of CD138 and anti Kappa antibodies. Laboratory evaluation showed a white blood cell count of 22 X 10 9 /L with 58 % of plasma cells, haemoglobin of 8.6 g / dl, normal platelet count. The peripheral blood smear showed red blood cell rolls and an atypical appearance of white blood cells. The blood chemistry found a creatinin at 15.6 mg /L (reference range < 12 mg/L) urea at 0.71 g /L (reference range < 0.4 g/L) and calcium at 100mg/L. Electrophoresis of blood and urine proteins showed respectively the presence of a monoclonal peak of gamma globulin 79.5 g/L and Bence Jones protein free Kappa. The bone marrow biopsy demonstrated diffuse infiltration with 96% of atypical plasma cells. On the skull x-ray lytic lesions were visible. The patient was referred to the haematology department where the examination was supplemented by flow cytometry on peripheral blood which showed 48% of plasma cell population with Kappa monotypic antigen, positivity to CD38+/CD138+ at 98%, CD19+ and CD56+. CD20 and CD117 antigen were not expressed. The cytogenetic examination of bone was a failure. Treatment according to the protocol Cyclophosphamide, Thalidomide and Dexamethasone was started but a rapid deterioration of the clinical appearance of the patient was observed, followed by a pulmonary embolism."
