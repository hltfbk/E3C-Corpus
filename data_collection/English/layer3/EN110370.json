  "text": "A 30-year-old female unmarried patient, with no medical history, having had menars at the age of 13 years, with regular cycles, had consulted for a vulvar mass which appeared recently since 3 months and increasing gradually in volume and causing a discomfort at the perineum especially in sitting and walking. On vulvar examination, there was a firm multilobulate pedicled mass measuring 5cm located at the posterior surface of the left large lip. The suprapubic pelvic ultrasound did not reveal intrauterine fibroid.\nThe patient had a surgical excision of the vulva mass under local anesthesia. Microscopic examination revealed a proliferation of smooth muscle fibers which were gathered in intertwined bundles and separated by fibrosis and congestive vessels. The muscle fibers had a regular elongate nucleus with fine chromatin without atypical mitosis. The peripheral fibrous capsule was respected. Morphological analysis concluded to a vulvar leiomyoma. There was no recurrence after 24-months' follow-up."
