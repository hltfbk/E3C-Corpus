  "text": "A 70-year-old multiparous woman presented with an abdominal mass of 20-year duration. A large cystic swelling was detected on computed tomography scan that was found to arise from the left adnexal region. This 19 kg lesion was found arising from the broad ligament. It was successfully removed. A detailed pathological study, including immunohistochemistry, was required to diagnose the lesion as a cystic lymphangioma."
