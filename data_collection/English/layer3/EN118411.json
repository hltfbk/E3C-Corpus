  "text": "We report the case of a 20-year-old Somalian man, who presented with an inversion injury to his ankle. When further history was taken, it transpired that he had sustained trauma to his ankle in Somalia 4 years previously, complicated by a non-healing wound. His foot pain and swelling had been present ever since. Diagnosis of tuberculosis was made by bone biopsy, histology of which demonstrated caseating granulomas. Tissue culture yielded growth of tuberculous bacilli. The patient made a full recovery on anti-tuberculous treatment."
