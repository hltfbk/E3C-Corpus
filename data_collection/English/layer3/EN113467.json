  "text": "A 64-year-old man with a history of a brain abscess, for which he underwent surgery 6 months previously, developed a left-sided hemothorax. He had experienced recurrent epistaxis and received anticoagulation therapy for chronic atrial fibrillation. Chest CT after drainage revealed a solitary 15-mm nodule in the periphery of the left lower lobe, and identification of a feeding artery and draining vein on three-dimensional CT suggested that the node was a PAVM. The PAVM was adjacent to the diaphragm and multi-detector CT (MDCT) and three-dimensional CT (3DCT) showed that the nodule slightly displaced the diaphragm and protruded into the pleural cavity. After discussion in a multidisciplinary conference, it was decided that surgical treatment would be preferable to catheter embolization. The patient underwent VATS with three ports, the largest of which was 15 mm. The PAVM protruded from the peripheral lung like a polyp, and wedge resection was performed after simple adhesiolysis. There were no complications, and the patient is asymptomatic after 1-year of follow-up."
