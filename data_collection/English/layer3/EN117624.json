  "text": "A 70-year-old Caucasian woman, with no previous history of hematological or liver diseases, was treated with ticlopidine 250 mg twice daily immediately after a vertebrobasilar stroke. Upon admission, her blood tests were normal. About four weeks later she developed agranulocytosis and hepatic toxicity. Ticlopidine was discontinued immediately, and aspirin 25 mg and dipyridamole 200 mg were given twice daily. She was treated with hematopoietic growth factors (granulocyte colony stimulating factor), with a rapidly increased white blood count and progressive normalization of liver tests as a result."
