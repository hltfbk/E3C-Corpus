  "text": "We present a case of seemingly benign epithelial inclusions within the pleura of a sixty year-old male patient who underwent exploratory thoracotomy and subsequent resection of bullous emphysematous blebs. Examination of the surgical specimen revealed well-defined nests of benign-appearing epithelial cells in glandular configurations at multiple sites within the pleura. These cells were immunopositive for TTF-1 and CK7 and immunonegative for calretenin, CK20, and CEA, indicating pulmonary epithelial derivation. Six months after resection, the patient is in stable health, with no clinical or radiologic evidence of bronchogenic carcinoma."
