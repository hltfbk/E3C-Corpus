  "text": "We report a 68-year-old woman with MP who suffered from delirium, seizure, long QT syndrome on electrocardiogram (ECG), severe cardiac arrhythmias of multiple origins, and cardiac arrest. She was intubated and put on blood perfusion. Her kidney and liver functions were intact; creatine kinase-MB was mildly elevated, and then fell within normal range during her hospital stay. We sent the mushrooms she left for translation elongation factor subunit 1Î±, ribosomal RNA gene sequence, and internal transcribed spacer sequence analyses. There were four kinds of mushrooms identified, two of which were found to be toxic."
