  "text": "We present a 4-month female patient who has been unwell from 2 weeks of life. The baby was delivered at term with weight of 3.0 kg and discharged uneventfully. At 2 weeks of age developed cough that progressively worsened over a week with post tussive vomiting and no fevers. The baby was able to breastfeed, had no breathing difficulties or worsening of cough during feeds. There was no contact with persons with chronic cough or pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). There was no family history of smoking and biomass fuel use. She was treated thrice for a probable bacterial infection with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole respectively with no benefit as an outpatient.\nThe infant worsened and was admitted at 1-month age. Clinically was wasted (weight 2.2kg; weight to height z score of -3SD), afebrile, had tachycardia and was in severe respiratory distress (respiratory rate (RR)= 78/minute, use of accessory muscles and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 40% off oxygen). On auscultation had bilateral equal air entry with crackles. The other systems were normal. An initial impression of possible aspiration pneumonia was made. Septic screen, TB screen, HIV, Cytomegalo virus (CMV) antibodies and fecal elastase were negative. Vitamin D3 level, echocardiogram and barium swallow were normal. The initial chest radiographs were reported as bronchopneumonia and with subsequent radiographs showing ground glass appearance, a thought of ChILD was considered. With no improvement since a week of admission, CT scan of the chest was done that showed ground glass appearance, air bronchograms and pleural thickening in the posterior recesses and no lymphadenopathy. The infant initially was started on nebulization (3% hypertonic saline and levo-salbutamol), esomeprazole, domperidone and supportive care. With no improvement various antibiotics and antifungal were given over the following month (cefuroxime, vancomycin, meropenem, amikacin and clarithromycin and fluconazole). At the age of 3 months was started on 1.5mg/kg/24 hours of prednisone and other medications were stopped. Clinical improvement was noted within a week of treatment; the RR was 55/minute with normal breath sounds and no crackles. The SaO 2 was 95-99% on nasal prongs at 2L/min, had weight gain and was able to breast feed. The dose was tapered down to 1mg/kg/24 hours and a week later gained weight to 3 kg, RR= 45/minute and stay off oxygen for 2 hours with SaO 2 > 95%. While the patient was recuperating in hospital, developed probable nosocomial pneumonia 26 days after starting prednisone and died."
