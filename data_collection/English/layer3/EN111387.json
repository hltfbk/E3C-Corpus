  "text": "In this report, we described the case of a 73-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with a lesser omental hernia caused by previous total colectomy. The patient underwent emergency surgery, and the intraoperative findings revealed a 200-cm segment of the small intestine was herniated through a defected lesser omentum (approximately 3 × 4 cm) from the lesser retrogastric curvature of the stomach. Besides, we summarize the specific abdominal computed tomography (CT) findings of lesser omental hernia by reviewing the literature."
