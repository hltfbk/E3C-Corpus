  "text": "We report on a 15-year-old boy with acrofrom upper limbs and mixed appearance of radiolucency, cysts and striae of fibro-chondromatosis. Lower limbs (femoral, tibial and fibular dysplasia showed enlarged metaphyses near the knees bilaterally) were present. Additional features of short stature, macrocephaly, facial dysmorphism, and generalised platyspondyly have been encountered. These bone shortenings were associated with bone bending, curving and rhizomelia of the upper limbs with significant macrodactyly. Limitations in articular movements were present. The forearm deformities were similar to those observed in hereditary multiple exostosis."
