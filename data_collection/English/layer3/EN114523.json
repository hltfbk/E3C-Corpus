  "text": "An 8-year old boy was diagnosed with a Ewing sarcoma in the left femur. On biopsy the morphology was typical and there was an EWSR1-FLI1 gene fusion. He underwent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and resection of the tumor. On microscopic evaluation, part of the tumor showed ganglioneuroblastoma-like differentiation with expression of neuronal markers. The continued presence of EWSR1 rearrangement in both the blue round cell component and the ganglioneuroblastoma-like component was shown by FISH analysis."
