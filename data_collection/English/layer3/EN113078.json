  "text": "A patient had bilateral HV and crossover deformities of her feet. She opted for a bilateral surgical treatment when conservation management failed to be helpful anymore. A soft tissue non-osteotomy technique called syndesmosis procedure was chosen for her deformities correction. Her crossover deformity was caused mainly by varus deformity of the second toe. Intraoperatively, the second toe varus deformity was found to correct itself spontaneously once the first metatarsal was realigned by a non-osteotomy intermetatarsal cerclage suture technique to correct the MPV deformity. Only themore severe second toe deformity of right foot required additional soft tissue release to help correct its mild residual varus deformity. The patient enjoyed excellent cosmetic and functional results. The possible pathogenesis of second toe varus deformity and its unexpected spontaneous correction is discussed."
