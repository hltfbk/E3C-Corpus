  "text": "In this report, a 47-year-old woman who received a kidney transplantation from an infant donor and developed a mass in the transplanted kidney is presented. Pathological examinations revealed a malignant tumor with rhabdoid cells morphologically and the loss of INI1 expression immunohistochemically. The diagnosis of malignant rhabdoid tumor in the transplanted kidney was made. We confirmed that donor-to-recipient malignancy transmission was the cause of MRT in the transplanted kidney by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and short tandem repeat (STR) analysis."
