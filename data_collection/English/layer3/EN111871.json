  "text": "An 88-year-old Causasian woman presented with a large, ulcerated, left prescapular cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (T3N0M0). Complete excision was performed, and the resulting defect was reconstructed with a dorsal intercostal artery perforator flap based on two perforators. Postoperative recovery was uncomplicated and adjuvant radiotherapy commenced 10â€‰weeks later."
