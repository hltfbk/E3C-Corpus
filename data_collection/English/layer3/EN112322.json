  "text": "Before neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all three cases underwent loop transverse colostomy for symptomatic colonic obstruction. Case 1: after 6 courses of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX), we performed sigmoid colectomy and partial resection of the bladder. The histological examination revealed pathological complete response (pCR). The final diagnosis was ypStage 0 (ypT0ypN0M0). Case 2: after 13 courses of CAPOX plus bevacizumab, we performed Hartmann's operation with partial resection of the bladder. The histological examination revealed pCR. The final diagnosis was ypStage 0 (ypT0ypN0M0). Case 3: after 6 courses of chemotherapy with CAPOX plus bevacizumab, we performed sigmoid colectomy and partial resection of the bladder. The pathological response was grade 1a according to the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma. The final diagnosis was ypStage IIC (ypT4bypN0M0). All three cases underwent capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy after radical surgery and patients are alive without recurrence."
