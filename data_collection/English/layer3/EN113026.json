  "text": "The patient was a 44-year-old Japanese man who complained swelling of the right mandible. Radiographic examination showed a multilocular radiolucency area in the left mandible. Radiographic findings on our case resembled those of a common benign tumor. The lesion occupied to the premolar and molar area and revealed that the tumor resorbed the roots of the teeth. The lesion was removed surgically with the buccal cortical bone and buccal mucosa in contact with the mass of the tumor. The mass fully excised intraorally under general anesthesia, and the inferior alveolar nerve in contact with the mass was preserved. The specimen was pathologically diagnosed as a glomus tumor. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for vimentin, muscle-specific actin/HHF35, and calponin. A hairline-shaped area of positive staining for type IV collagen surrounding the tumor cells was also observed. In contrast, staining for alpha-SMA, cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), cytokeratin (CAM5.2), CK19, CD31, CD34, CD68, p63, S-100, Factor VIII, and desmin was all negative. The Ki-67 labeling index was almost 1%. A recurrent tumor was again detected in the site below the primary tumor at an 8-year follow-up, and it was surgically removed. The patient has had no symptoms of recurrence in 2Â years after the second operation."
