  "text": "We describe a patient on adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer that was prescribed rifampin for TB prophylaxis prior to initiation of an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α agent due to worsening ulcerative colitis. This 39 year old Caucasian woman had been followed by our personalized medicine clinic where CYP2D6 genotyping and therapeutic monitoring of tamoxifen and endoxifen levels had been carried out. The patient, known to be a CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizer, had a previous history of therapeutic endoxifen levels. Upon admission to hospital for a major flare of her ulcerative colitis a clinical decision was made to initiate an anti-TNFα biological agent. Due to concerns regarding latent TB, rifampin as an anti-mycobacterial agent was initiated which the patient was only able tolerate for 10 days. Interestingly, her plasma endoxifen concentration measured 2 weeks after cessation of rifampin was sub-therapeutic at 15.8 nM and well below her previous endoxifen levels which exceeded 40 nM."
