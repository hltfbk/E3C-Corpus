  "text": "The onset of symptoms was 3 d after birth in our patient with progressive cyanosis and respiratory distress, and a large amount of green fluid was noticed in her respiratory secretion. We performed computed tomography (CT), fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and cholangiography to make a diagnosis, as well as fistulography with a bronchoscope for the first time. These examinations provided us with valuable images to make a correct diagnosis. The fistula was dissected and removed with excellent results. Surgical removal of the fistula was successful, and the baby recovered well and was discharged. She has been followed for 4 mo without any signs of discomfort."
