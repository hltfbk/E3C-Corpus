  "text": "We experienced a case of severe tinnitus with bilateral deafness for more than 50â€‰years. The patient is a 69-year-old woman who communicates with her family solely in sign language. Family stress triggered the onset of tinnitus, accompanied by sleep disorder and palpitations. At the initial visit, she suffered from severe tinnitus (THI 94) as well as strong tendencies toward depression and anxiety. Because neither the patient nor her family was willing to use cochlear implantation, the administration of an antidepressant and a sleep-inducing agent was started, which resulted in improvement of the psychological conditions. Tinnitus distress, synchronized with the heartbeat, was relieved by the addition of autogenic training. At four and half years after the initial visit, the THI score had dropped to 0, and the subjective tinnitus and palpitation had almost disappeared, with only a low dose of antidepressant necessary."
