  "text": "A 28-year-old male student presented with history of acute pain in right hip and inability to walk after a squatting event. He was diagnosed to have osteonecrosis of bilateral femoral head 1 year back, for which he denied further treatment. On clinical examination, right hip examination was painful with flexion, adduction, and external rotation deformity. Radiological examination revealed fracture at subcapital region in neck of right femur with osteonecrosis of femoral head. After discussing treatment options with the patient, we performed total hip arthroplasty (THA). Harris hip scores improved from 17.1 to 83.5."
