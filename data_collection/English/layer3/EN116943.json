  "text": "A 27-year-old Caucasian man complaining of a nasal obstruction was admitted to our clinic in January 2006. A transnasal endoscopic examination revealed a mass arising from the nasal septum which was completely removed using an endoscopic approach. Histologically, it was determined to be a benign teratoma."
