  "text": "A 46-year-old female presented with complaints of swelling over the front of the right index finger for 1½years. The swelling was spontaneous, painless, and very slowly progressive. Examination revealed a 2 cm × 1.5 cm firm swelling situated on the palmar aspect of the right index finger over distal part of middle phalanx and proximal part of the distal phalanx. Swelling was well defined, having smooth surface, uniformly firm consistency and could be moved sideways easily. X-ray of the hand showed localized soft tissue shadow in the involved area without any bony involvement. Ultrasonography of the finger showed soft tissue mass. FNAC examination reported the swelling as GCTTS. Excisional biopsy was done. Histopathology showed typical features of GCTTS."
