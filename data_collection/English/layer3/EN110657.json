  "text": "This case report described a 12-week treatment course for a 39-year-old Persian man with treatment-refractory schizophrenia, who showed a significant improvement in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms after taking ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg capsules twice a day. Also, ursodeoxycholic acid was well tolerated, and he did not exhibit any side effects during treatment, based on interview and physical examination."
