  "text": "A 56-year-old man presented with a chronic history of index fingertip pain to the orthopedic clinic. There was a partial resolution of symptoms earlier when commenced on anti-inflammatory and antibiotics in community by the general practitioner. A thorough clinical and radiological evaluation followed by a surgical debridement completely cured his symptoms. S. lugdunensis was isolated on culture in this case."
