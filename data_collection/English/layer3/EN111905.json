  "text": "A 79-year-old man presented with hoarseness of voice and swallowing difficulty. Eighteen months earlier, he had undergone preoperative chemotherapy (S-1 and oxaliplatin [SOX] therapy) and subtotal esophagectomy with regional lymph nodes dissection and retrosternal narrow gastric tube reconstruction for advanced Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma. In the ultrasonographic examination, there was a hypoechoic, indistinct border and heterogeneous nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid gland. Pathological examination of an ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration showed adenocarcinoma, supporting a diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma metastases in the thyroid."
