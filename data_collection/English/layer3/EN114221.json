  "text": "An 11-year-old, right-hand dominant boy presented in casualty with a history of fall one day back with pain, swelling and deformity in the left forearm with bleeding from left forearm and loss of movement of fingers and thumb of the left hand. On examination, there was a wound of size one centimeter on mid-forearm over the ulnar aspect. Extension of fingers and thumb at metacarpophalangeal joints was lost with intact sensations suggestive of posterior interosseus nerve involvement. No vascular was deficit was present. X-rays were performed which suggested type two epiphyseal separation proximal radius with fracture shaft ulna with lateral angulation in elbow and proximal forearm. Radiocapitellar joint congruity was maintained in the views performed. X-rays of wrist suggested fracture both bones distal forearm epiphysis in distal radius and distal shaft in ulna. The patient was operated with toileting, debridement, and open reduction of proximal ulnar fracture with K-wire. Proximal radius epiphyseal separation was approached by Kocher approach and fixed with two K-wires, while for distal radius epiphyseal separation open reduction and internal fixation was performed. Follow-up of the patient showed posterior interosseus nerve recovery and subsequent union of all fractures with good functional outcome."
