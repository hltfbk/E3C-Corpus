  "text": "In these case series, four cases of AVMs after cesarean procedures will be reviewed. One could be diagnosed in less than a month but the other three took several months. The symptom of vaginal bleeding might occur a few weeks after the procedure is done, and most patients need transfusion and hospitalization. Three out of four patients were initially sent to the hospital in order to recover from shock condition, and one patient was sent for a diagnostic procedure. AVMs diagnostic was established with ultrasound with or without angiography. Three of our cases were succeeded by performing TAE procedure without further severe vaginal bleeding. One case failed to be treated with embolization and had to proceed with hysterectomy."
