  "text": "A 64 year-old Caucasian man was admitted to the gastroenterology department for severe weakness, left lower quadrant abdominal pain, weight loss and diarrhoea. Physical examination revealed a palpable firm mass occupying the entire left part of the abdomen. Abdominal CT-scan showed fatty infiltration of the mesosigmoid and left mesocolic fat which was strongly suggestive of panniculitis. Laparoscopic surgery revealed an inflamed and edematous mesocolon and mesosigmoid; the sigmoid mucosa appeared petechial which was suggestive of venous ischemia. Histological examination of surgical biopsies revealed mesocolic panniculitis. Despite exhaustive investigation, no associated conditions were found and the cause was classified as idiopathic. Surprisingly, the patient clinically improved without therapeutic intervention other than supportive care."
