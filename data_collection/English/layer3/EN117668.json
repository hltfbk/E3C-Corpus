  "text": "A case of uterine primitive neuroectodermal tumor with adenosarcoma in a 50-year-old Asian Indian woman is presented. Histologically, the neoplasm displayed perivascular pseudorosettes and occasional Homer-Wright rosettes. A strong positivity for neuronspecific enolase and synaptophysin was noted, while chromogranin and CD99 were negative. Merging imperceptibly with the neuroectodermal components were the areas of adenosarcoma."
