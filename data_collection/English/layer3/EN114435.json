  "text": "A 12-year-female was admitted in our institute for short stature with a dysmorphic facies for evaluation. The patient reported a history of multiple fractures of the long bones after a trivial fall. On physical examination, she had the following features: short stature, limited mouth opening, short hands and feet with dysplastic nails; frontal and occipital bossing; and hypoplasia of the maxilla and mandible. Examination of the mouth: grooved palate, caries of the teeth, impacted and malposed teeth, persistent deciduous teeth and missing teeth. Laboratory investigations were normal. The radiographic examination showed a generalized increase in the bone density, slight condensation of the skull base and a very open mandibular angle. X-rays showed tapered phalanges with acro-osteolysis of the distal phalanges. A symptomatic treatment was proposed based on fracture prevention, oral hygiene, frequent dental visits and psychiatric support."
