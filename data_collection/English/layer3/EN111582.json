  "text": "We present 3 examples of invasion of the lumbosacral plexus and its branches. These cases demonstrate a protean clinical picture with regards to the time relationship to the clinical course of lymphoma and the neuroanatomical extent of lumbosacral plexus invasion. We demonstrate the complementary role of different imaging modalities. A review of the literature summarizes 23 reports where lumbosacral plexus invasion was the index manifestation, at the time of first diagnosis or recurrence of lymphoma. This series confirms the strong preponderance of B-cell type (92%). There is a marked predilection for involvement of the sciatic nerve (74%), either focally or in a longitudinally extensive fashion, from the ischium to the popliteal fossa. There can also be restricted and discrete involvement of tibial and fibular branches. In recent years, ultrasound and CT have been given a more limited role, as screening tools or as a guide for biopsy. MRI neurography and PET-CT have become leading diagnostic modalities for diagnosis, staging and assessment of treatment response."
