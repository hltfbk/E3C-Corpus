  "text": "A 41-year-old white man with a long history of retinal hemangioblastoma presented with neovascularization of his iris and cornea as well as corneal perforation. His right eye was blind and painful, leading to a decision of enucleation. On microscopy, the enucleated eye showed neovascularization of the cornea and iris. The cornea was perforated with an expulsive hemorrhage and extruding intraocular contents, including the retina. A large retinal hemangioblastoma was located at the posterior pole adjacent to the optic nerve head. The tumor was mainly composed of large cells with foamy cytoplasm. Bone formation was also present."
