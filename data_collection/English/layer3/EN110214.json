  "text": "The patient is 52 year-old, weighed 46.7 Kg with height measuring 1, 60 m. She has a body surface area of 1.59 m 2. She hails from North Africa. She is a grand multipara with 5 children Alive. She neither smokes nor drinks alcohol.There is no family history suggestive of autoimmunediseases, genital cancers, and other malignancies.She is Blood group oRh positive with nil presence of irregular agglutinins. She developed Hashimoto thyroiditis since 1995 and is on Levothyrox and Cortancyl. She is also taking beta blockers for hypertension with arrhythmias.She is three years post-menopausal and under Hormonal Replacement Therapy. She was admitted in the Department of Neurology of the Centre Hospitalier de Cherbourg for vertigo. Clinical examination revealed an isolated cerebellar syndrome with positive Romberg, positive Finger-Nose Test,and horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze. All tests for aetiology were negative including tumor markers and radiological imaging. Clinical gynecologicalexamination was normal. The initial diagnostic hypothesis made was a Meningo-encephalocerebellitis of viral origin. There waspersistence and even aggravation of the cerebellar syndrome despite all the treatments. It was decided that a specific determination of auto neuronal antibodies be made: searching antibodies anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-Ta. There was a resultant positivity for anti Yo antibody in the cerebral spinal fluid and serum of the patient. Based on this fact the search for a gynecologic cancer had been undertaken. The mammography revealed micro calcifications on the left breast. A lumpectomy after x-ray identification of these micro calcifications, at the level of the left breast was done. The frozen section histology showed an intraductal carcinoma of high grade with 2 focus, 3mm and 1mm corresponding to Infiltrating left breast carcinoma,grade II tumor of Scarff and Bloom, estrogen and progesterone receptor positive: it wasa multifocal cancer (SBRII, 21 N + / 26, RH +, low Ki 67). A mastectomy of the left breast with ganglion clearing was done immediately. Clearing covered 26 lymph nodes, of which 21 were metastatic and some with capsular rupture. Next, adjuvant chemotherapy type FEC 100 (5-Fluorouracil, Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide) was undertaken in 6 Cycles. The histological result of the mastectomy specimen confirmed an infiltrating intraductal carcinoma,grade II tumor of Scarff and Bloom. Radiotherapy of ganglion chains of bleeding and chest wall about the mastectomy scar was then carried out over a period of two months. The patient was placed under hormonal therapy for 5 years (Tamoxifen 20 mg per day). Seven months after her presentation at the hospital, dizziness disappeared, her gait became better coordinated.She was being followed up on a regular basis for any new breast pathology."
