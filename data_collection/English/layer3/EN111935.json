  "text": "We report a case of a six-month-old Cameroonian female infant, born at home and taken the following day to a primary healthcare facility for neonatal care. Her mother had no antenatal care until birth. She presented at our health center with respiratory distress and fever. She had a temperature of 38.8 °C and signs of left lung basal consolidation, suggestive of a left lower lober pneumonia, confirmed on chest x-ray. Other incidental clinical findings were several dysmorphic features like bilateral cryptophthalmos, nasal malformation, anal imperforation (with a perianal fistula), an external genital anomaly and syndactyly characteristic of Fraser syndrome associated with pneumonia. The patient responded well to intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of her pneumonia. Thereafter, she was referred to a pediatric surgeaon for surgical corrections of her bilateral cryptophthalmos, anal imperforation, external genital defect and syndactyly."
