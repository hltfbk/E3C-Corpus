  "text": "Two women each had a mass located on the lower vaginal-rectal space as determined by transvaginal ultrasound (TV-US), pelvis MR imaging, and colonoscopy. The patients successfully underwent transvaginal excision. The spindle-shaped cells were found in pathological test. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that CD117 and Dog-1 were stained positively. These results confirmed the masses as GISTs. The postoperative period was uneventful without anal dysfunction. Two patients were received adjuvant treatment with imatinib after surgery."
