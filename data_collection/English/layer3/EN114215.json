  "text": "A 57-year-old man, right-handed, bipolar schizophrenic, presented after a fall, a fracture of the head and metaphysis of the humerus from the anterior notch of posterior dislocation of the right humerus. An osteosynthesis was performed after reduction on the tenth posttraumatic day. The postoperative period was complicated because of early ossifications and painless stiffness of the shoulder."
