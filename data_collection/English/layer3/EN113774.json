  "text": "The authors present here a case of 10-year-old child with a history of dislocation of right elbow that was reduced elsewhere and the child presented to us with stiffness and restriction of movements at the elbow with the features of high median nerve injury. On further evaluation with ultrasound, the median nerve was found to be entrapped in the elbow behind the medial epicondyle. Medial condyle osteotomy was done to release the median nerve and to provide the relief of symptoms."
