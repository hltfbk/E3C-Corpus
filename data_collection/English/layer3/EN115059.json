  "text": "A 64-year-old caucasian man after two previous ablation procedures for drug resistant atrial fibrillation in recent four years, which included pulmonary vein isolation and linear left atrial lesions, was referred for the treatment of recurrent perimitral flutter. Despite the third attempt to create bidirectional block at the mitral isthmus region, we were not even able to stop the arrhythmia by aggressive unipolar radiofrequency ablation both from the left atrium and coronary sinus, because of deeply embedded slow conducting channel probably around the vein of Marshall. Arrhythmia was finally terminated and the block was achieved by bipolar radiofrequency ablation between two irrigated-tip catheters positioned at the left atrial endocardium and contralaterally inside the coronary sinus."
