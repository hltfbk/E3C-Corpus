  "text": "This case report describes a 43-year-old woman with sudden vision loss in her left eye for 20Â days after single sudden syncope. Fundus examination of the left eye showed obscure boundary of optic disc with, reflective dispersion of the retina and poor light reflex of central fovea. A retinal artery occlusion was found in her left eye. Echocardiography revealed a tumor in the left atrium. Visual capacity improved a little during the follow-up."
