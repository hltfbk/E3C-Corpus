  "text": "Here, we report a case of severe hypocalcemia due to an antibody-mediated hypoparathyroidism as an immune-related adverse event (irAE) in a patient who was treated with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab and anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab. Hypocalcemia was rapidly corrected by substitution, but the endogenous serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) remained low. The patient demonstrated a rapid and profound tumor response to the combination immune checkpoint blockade, but developed a severe colitis that required high-dose intravenous corticosteroid and anti-TNFα therapy. During this strong immunosuppression the PTH level normalized and the calcium levels were stable without substitution. However, during tapering of immunosuppressants, the PTH and calcium levels decreased again to a level requiring calcium substitution."
