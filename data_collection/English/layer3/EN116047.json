  "text": "The present case report is about a 42-year-old, Mrs. SR, P5 L3 D1 A1 , presented with the complaints of intermittent bleeding per vaginum since last 3 years and severe pain in the right lower limb since 1 month. On examination, there was a proliferative growth in the cervix. Her magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed cervical mass lesion with right parametrial extension invading the right ureter and bladder wall causing hydroureteronephrosis with contiguous bilateral pelvic nodes. There were multiple lesions in the left femur. Diagnosis of carcinoma of cervix International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIB with distant metastasis was made. Histopathology report was suggestive of sarcomatoid carcinoma with foci of melanocytic melanoma. She was planned to be treated with palliative radiation."
