  "text": "A five-year-old girl presented to the hospital for a routine retina check-up. The patient was born prematurely with a gestation age of 27 weeks and a body weight of 980 grams. She had a history of stage 4A ROP in the right eye and received scleral buckling. After pupil dilation with 1 % tropicamide and 10 % phenylephrine for retinal examination, acute elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) was observed in the right eye. Her IOP remained over 50 mmHg in the right eye even under treatment with oral acetazolamide and maximal tolerated doses of topical anti-glaucoma medications. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) showed that the angle in the right eye was closed 360 degrees circumferentially. In order to lower IOP, trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (0.2 mg/cc) was performed under general anesthesia. Postoperatively, the cornea became clear, the filtering bleb functioned well, and IOP returned to normal values. In the two-year follow-up, IOP was kept around 15 mmHg without anti-glaucoma medications. Although mild lens opacity was noted, her postoperative VA remained 20/200 in the right eye."
