  "text": "Case 1 describes a 13-year-old Indonesian boy who had undergone hemodialysis since 2014 after being diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to bilateral renal hypoplasia. Later, he had HCV infection and was treated with interferon-based therapy with ribavirin prior to living-related renal transplantation (LRRT). The HCV was undetected and his liver function normalized six months after treatment initiation. However, 10 months after treatment initiation, he had HCV virological breakthrough, leading to cessation of interferon therapy. Plans for LRRT were continued and HCV treatment using DAAs was set up to be given post LRRT. Case 2 describes a 14-year-old Indonesian girl who also had hemodialysis prior to LRRT after she was diagnosed with ESRD secondary to nephrotic syndrome. Later, she had HCV infection and was treated with interferon and ribavirin prior to the live-unrelated renal transplantation. HCV infection did not resolve, in addition, she experienced thrombocytopenia-which is a side effect of interferon-resulting in termination of interferon treatment. Both cases were treated with DAAs one year following renal transplantation after reaching stable graft function, leading to achievement of sustained virological response at 24 weeks."
