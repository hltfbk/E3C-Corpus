Abdominal examination showed 14 weeks uterus with β-hCG level of 14,889 mIU/ml. Slides review confirmed the diagnosis of placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). Patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and resection of anterior vaginal wall mass. Post operative (48 h) β-hCG level was 6016 mIU/ml.
