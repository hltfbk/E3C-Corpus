  "text": "We present a 70-year-old patient who has been on systemic therapy with a combined drug of amlodipine and valsartan since 2008 and only valsartan from 2015. Three years after the first intake of valsartan (2011), the patient developed a pigment lesion on the right arm. Approximately 2.5 years after doubling the dose of valsartan, the patient observed a progression in the size of the lesion, which was the cause of the dermatological examination and hospitalisation for surgical removal. The melanocytic lesion was removed by radical excision and a surgical field of 0.5 cm in all directions, followed by histological verification, which found the presence of cutaneous melanoma with a tumour thickness of 3 mm. A re-excision was planned with an additional surgical field of 1.5 cm in all directions combined with parallel removal of a draining lymph node."
