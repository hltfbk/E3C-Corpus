  "text": "We discuss the case of an 11-year-old African female who presented with a chronic disfiguring cervical mass evolving over a 9Â months period for which she had several unyielding consultations. Appropriate clinical and para-clinical evaluations were paramount to the diagnosis of an Actinomyces infection. We review the literature on its epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis."
