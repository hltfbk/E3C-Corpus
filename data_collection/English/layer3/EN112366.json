  "text": "A 50-year-old, previously healthy female presented with a 1-month history of cough and fever. CT scans showed a mass in the left lower lung, left pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and multiple swollen lymph nodes throughout the body. Based on the pathology of the left lung lesion, she was diagnosed with left primary pulmonary LELC complicated with T. marneffei. She received both anti-tumor and anti-fungal treatments. A subsequent CT re-examination demonstrated that the mass was absorbed remarkably after treatment. Follow up showed no tumor progression and no relapse of T. marneffei infection."
