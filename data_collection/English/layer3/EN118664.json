  "text": "The prenatal ultrasound examination of a 32-year-old Turkish woman who was referred to our clinic at 33 weeks and 6 days of gestation revealed fetal micromelia together with several other anomalies. The female baby died shortly after birth and was diagnosed with achondrogenesis type I based on the clinical and radiographic findings."
