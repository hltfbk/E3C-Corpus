  "text": "We report herein the case of a young female Caucasian patient aged 18 years with diffuse Gorham syndrome. In tissue specimens angiogenesis and massive lymphangiogenesis as well as the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and neuropilins was observed. Lymphangiogenesis is a prominent feature of the disease and a number of lymphatic markers were found to be expressed, however only VEGF-A, but not vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) was found to be elevated in the circulation. Circulating levels of soluble VEGF receptor-1 were also not elevated. Furthermore, the patient responded favorably and the disease was stabilized following treatment with the beta-blocking agent Propranolol alone which acts on VEGF-A alone, but not on soluble VEGF receptor-1 levels."
