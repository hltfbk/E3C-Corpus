  "text": "Baby boy with 26 weeks gestation and weight of 490 grams was born by Caesarean section in view of pregnancy induced hypertension and absent Doppler signals. Mother's serology was negative with no history of premature rupture of membranes. Baby required surfactant and medically treated for patent ductus arteriosus. Baby was referred to us at 11 weeks of postnatal age for spontaneous pneumoperitoneum. Closure of duodenal perforation and ileostomy were done after which baby remained stable. He was on room air and reached to full feeds within two weeks of surgery. At eighteen weeks of postnatal age, he developed tachycardia, tachypnoea with fluctuations in SpO2. Seven hours into acute setback, fingers became cold with distal phalanx of index finger on right hand found to have dark bluish discoloration, however blood pressure was normal. Extremity was not pricked for any sampling, venous or arterial cannulation. Black streaky line over nail of left middle finger, index finger and thumb appeared within next 6-8 hours. List of investigations as shown in Table 1. The diagnosis of peripheral tissue ischemia secondary to septic emboli was made. Antibiotics were started immediately after collecting blood sample to rule out sepsis in view of tachycardia, tachypnoea and SpO2 fluctuations. Contralateral limb warming was done to provide reflex vasodilatation. In consultation with plastic surgeon, within 24 hours of onset of ischemic changes, we started applying Nitroglycerin patch 2.5 mg/kg (5 mg patch cut into two halves). It was applied twelve hours a day, extending up to 1 cm proximal to line of discoloration and continued for five days. After 24 hours of starting treatment, significant improvement in color and perfusion were noted locally. Further gradual improvement to complete recovery of digital ischemic changes were noted in 5 days with only scab formation on fingertip and which completely healed in 2 weeks. Blood pressure and methemoglobin levels remained stable throughout the course of NGL treatment. Cranial ultrasounds did not show any change from baseline. The time of events is listed in Table 2."
