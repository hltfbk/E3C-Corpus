  "text": "We present a 44-year-old woman with a history of endometriosis who consults for chronic pelvic pain. In the imaging tests, a heterogeneous mass is observed that impresses endometriosis, encompassing the uterus and left appendage. Surgery is performed by finding an extrauterine adenosarcoma that affected the uterus, ovary and bladder wall."
