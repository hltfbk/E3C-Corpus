  "text": "We present a case of arteriovenous malformations within jejunal diverticulosis in a 68-year-old male presented with lower gastrointestinal bleeding. After admission and stabilization, upper and lower endoscopies were performed without demonstrating the bleeding site. They only revealed clotted and red blood throughout the colon. Technetium-labeled red blood cell bleeding scan, endoscopic capsule, and selective angiography were performed to localize the site of bleeding without significant findings. As the clinical status of the patient deteriorated, exploratory laparotomy was performed urgently. Extensive jejunal saccular pouches were found 10 cm distal to duodenojejunal junction extending 1.6 m distally. Segmental resection was performed with side to side primary anastomosis. Microscopic examination of the specimen revealed many diverticula. He was followed up 2 years after that without complications."
