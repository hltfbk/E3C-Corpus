  "text": "A 7-year-old female child presented with pain and limp left hip for 6 weeks. She had a stiff hip gait. Clinical examination revealed a fixed abduction, flexion deformity, and restricted internal rotation with apparent lengthening of 2 cm. The ultrasonography revealed synovial effusion with synovial deposits. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed features of tuberculous synovitis, inflammatory synovitis, or a rare possibility of SC. Arthrotomy was performed following failed hip aspiration. Multiple chondral loose bodies were noted on incision of capsule. Partial synovectomy was also performed. The synovium histopathology revealed multiple synovial chondral inclusions. A final diagnosis of SC was made."
