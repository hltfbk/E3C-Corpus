  "text": "An 82-year-old female patient had 10-year-duration of palpable huge tumor on left breast which was in rapid growth in recent months. Total mastectomy of left breast was performed thereafter, and pathology diagnosis was malignant phyllodes tumor. Adjuvant radiotherapy was suggested while she declined out of personal reasons initially. For PTs recurred locally on left chest wall 2 months later, and excision of the recurrent PTs was performed. She, at length, completed adjuvant radiation therapy since then. Six months later, she was diagnosed of metastasis to stomach due to severe anemia with symptom of melena. Gastrostomy with tumor excision was performed for uncontrollable tumor bleeding."
