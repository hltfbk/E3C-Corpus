  "text": "A 32-year-old Moroccan traveling in the Democratic Republic of Congo for five month, had neglected his malaria chemoprophylaxis. He developed fever, confusion and became rapidly comatose. So he was transferred to Morocco. At neurologic examination, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was at 7, and he experienced in the emergency department an episode of tonic-clonic seizures lasting 30 seconds that was controlled by phenytoin administration. Plasmodium falciparum was seen on the blood smear. Other complications of malaria included acute renal failure, hepatic failure and retinopathy was determined. The patient was placed on mechanical ventilation. Specific treatment was started with intravenous doxycycline and quinine dihydrochloride. A brain CT on the first day was normal. A first brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), on day 3, performed on a 1.5-T unit included sagittal and axial 5-mm-thick T1-weighted images, axial 4-mm-thick T2-weighted images, susceptibility-weighted imaging \\(SWI), Gradient Echo (T2*) sequence, axial 4-mm-thick T1-weighted images, before and after contrast injection, and axial fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) sequences. The MRI showed diffuses hyperintensities on T2, T2- FLAIR-weighted and the SWI sequences images in the centrum semiovale, periventricular, frontal and occipital white matter, and in the cerebellum with central microhemorrhages in the occipital, frontal and right semiovale centrum white matter lesions on Gradient Echo (T2*) sequence. There was no enhancement on T1-weighted images. There was also no evidence for dural sinus thrombosis. The GCS slightly improved up to 9. Two weeks after the onset of neurologic symptoms, He was progressively weaned from the mechanical ventilation. There was also a recovery of renal and hepatic function.\nTwo weeks after the first examination (day 15), MRI showed disappearance of the cerebellum and periventricular lesions and minimal decrease in the size of the lesion of occipital, frontal and right semiovale centrum white matter. There was a few central enhancement of white matter haemorrhagics lesions on post-contrast T1-weigted images.\nOn day 32, the patient regained consciousness, had been discharged to a rehabilitation unit. After a 4 months follow-up, no significant neurological improvement was noted and the patient was classified left hemiparesis post cerebral malaria."
