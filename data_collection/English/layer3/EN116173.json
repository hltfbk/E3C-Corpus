  "text": "A 26-year-old man presented black stools and anemia. Endoscopic examination revealed a large pedunculated polyp at gastroduodenal junction. The polyp, subsequently resected by distal gastrectomy, was lobulated with random surface erosions and sized 6.4 Ã— 3 cm. Histological examination revealed that the polyp arose from duodenal mucosa and was composed of hyperplastic Brunner's glands in lobules separated by fibromuscular septa, associated with lymphocytic infiltrate and lymphoid follicles. No evidence of malignancy was found. Thus, the lesion was diagnosed as Brunner's gland hamartoma. Further immunohistochemical studies indicated that gastric foveolar metaplasia is associated with surface epithelium covering upper two thirds of the polyp, showing immunohistochemical positivity for mucin 5 AC (MUC5AC). Below the metaplastic surface epithelium, Brunner's glands had high proliferative activity (MIB-1 labeling index: 7.9%). The similar staining pattern was observed at surface erosive sites (MIB-1 labeling index in Brunner's glands: 9%). On the other hand, surface epithelium in the lower side of the polyp still preserved intestinal nature, containing CDX2-positive nuclei and MUC2-positive goblet cells. Brunner's glands below the surface epithelium with intestinal characteristics showed low proliferative activity (MIB-1 labeling index: 0.77%)."
