  "text": "A 24-year-old man with a known arterial thoracic outlet syndrome presented with a right cerebral posterior artery brain infarction. An ultrasound examination depicted the compression of the right subclavian artery in the scalene defile with a post stenotic aneurysm and the presence of a floating thrombus in this aneurysm. There was a reverse flow during diastole in this aneurysm. Anticoagulation was carried out with the disappearance of the floating thrombus with no new clinical or brain MRI event. Corrective surgery of this thoracic outlet syndrome was performed one month after stroke."
