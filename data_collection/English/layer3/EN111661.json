  "text": "A 73-year-old man suspected to have lower bile duct carcinoma was admitted to our hospital for further treatment. Three-dimensional computed tomography (3DCT) showed a common bile duct tumor and total occlusion of the SMA with collateral circulation of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). We performed a PD. During the operation, we used test clamping of the GDA, which revealed no bowel ischemia. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 30. 3DCT on POD 98 and POD 307 showed development of collateral circulation between the IMA and SMA."
