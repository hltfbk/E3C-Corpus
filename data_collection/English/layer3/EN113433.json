  "text": "We report a case of 60-year-old female presented with pain in the right hip that persisted for 2 months. Plain X-ray, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the right hip showed a lytic lesion involving the right acetabulum and adjoining iliac bone with extraosseous mass. The histopathological and immunohistochemical examination confirmed a diagnosis of DLBCL. Treatment with cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine, and prednisone plus rituximabestablished a complete response (CR) with remodeling of the acetabulum. At the last follow-up, the patient had the ability to walk without any support which obviates the need of primary surgical interference for the tumor."
