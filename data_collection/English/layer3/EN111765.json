  "text": "A 38-year-old man with a history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis presented with altered mental status; the initial diagnosis was hepatic encephalopathy. Although optimal treatment for hepatic encephalopathy was administered, the patient's mental status did not improve. A final diagnosis of NCSE was made by continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring. Treatment with levetiracetam and propofol pump was immediately started. The patient's consciousness gradually improved after discontinuation of propofol therapy, and no further epileptic discharge was observed by EEG monitoring. After 1 wk, the patient returned to full consciousness, and he was able to walk in the hospital ward without assistance. He was discharged with minimal sequela of bilateral conjunctivitis."
