  "text": "A 32Â year old African female presented with acute right upper quadrant abdominal pain and vaginal discharge, for which she had previously received treatment in another health center with no improvement. Clinical and laboratory findings were suggestive of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. Five days after treatment with oral doxycycline, the patient showed marked clinical improvement."
