  "text": "A 76-year-old Caucasian woman attended the ophthalmology department with acute severe bilateral eye pain. This occurred immediately after having pulled a weed out of her garden with her bare hands. She recalled having subsequently rubbed her eyes. The offending plant, was brought into hospital and was identified as the Caper Spurge (Euphorbia lathyris). Her ocular pH was alkaline (pH 9). After copious irrigation, the pH normalised. She was treated with topical steroids, cycloplegics, lubricants and opioid oral analgesia. Three days later, she was symptom-free and her vision had returned to normal."
