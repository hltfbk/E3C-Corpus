  "text": "We report the case of a 47-year-old patient with a medical history of codeine allergy, surgical appendectomy. She consulted for bilateral mastodynia. The examination found a 3 cm mass at the suspicious QSID, no associated axillary ADP. A mammography echo was requested showing three masses of QSID requiring histological verification especially the pre-chest mass of 15mm. Right breast grafted ACR 4, left breast graft ACR 1.A biopsy was made confirming the diagnosis of right breast mucinous carcinoma of carcinoma having as histo-protected grade modified SBR II. No overexpression of the HER 2 protein. An extension assessment (an abdominal ultrasound, a chest X-ray with a bone scan) does not show a secondary-level lesion. She had neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by a surgical treatment (Patey) which occured without incident. The evolution was marked by the appearance after 11 months of the intervention in a febrile context of a warm erythematous rash, painful and oedematous carrying the right patey scar and reaching the umbilicus, with purpuric lesions without crepitants or sensory disturbances or fistulization, without lymphoedema or associated ADP. The biological examination shows an increase in activated protein C at 159 mg/l, white blood cells at 27,000, normal fasting glucose. Ultrasound does not show an abscess or an underlying collection. As soon as the diagnosis of erysipelas on patey scar was retained, the patient was put on cefazol 2gr * 3 / day for 7 days intravenously injectable and rest. A clinico-biological improvement was noted (durable apyrexia with decrease of the CRP) hence the passage to the oral way. The evolution was marked by the complete disappearance of the rash and the edema."
