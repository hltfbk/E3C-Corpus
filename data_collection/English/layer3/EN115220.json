  "text": "We report on a 28-year-old female major trauma patient (injury severity score, ISS 50) who was involved in a motor vehicle accident. She was primarily transferred to a level II trauma center. After initial assessment and operative management, an anisocoria was diagnosed on the intensive care unit. Subsequent CT angiography and extracranial duplex sonography revealed a bilateral internal carotid artery dissection. The patient was transferred to our level I trauma center where conservative treatment with high-dose heparin therapy was started at day two after trauma. Outcome after 6 months was very good."
