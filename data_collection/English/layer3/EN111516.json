  "text": "We describe an infant with MSUD with the DBT gene mutation who had drowsiness and poor appetite as well as abnormal findings upon head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), plasma amino acid analysis and urine organic acid analysis. Genetic testing revealed that both parents had the heterozygous mutation c.1132C > T (p.378X) in chr1:100672078, and the patient had the homozygous mutations c.1132C > T (p.378X) in chr1:100672078. Once diagnosed with MSUD, the patient's disease was controlled with a diet of BCAA-free enteral formula and thiamine."
