  "text": "A 43-year-old man visited our hospital with the complaint of jaundice. He was diagnosed with inoperable advanced gastric cancer owing to invasion of the hepatic hilum by the tumor. After percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) and stent placement, capecitabine and oxaliplatin were administered as first-line palliative chemotherapy. The tumor progressed, and paclitaxel and ramucirumab were administered as second-line chemotherapy. However, on the first day of the second cycle, the patient suddenly developed dyspnea and pneumonia. BBF was diagnosed on the basis of the presence of bilious sputum and the results of computed tomography, and PTBD was repeated."
