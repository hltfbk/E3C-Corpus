  "text": "A 63-year-old man presented with acute dysphonia immediately after insertion of a Hickman line via the subclavian route. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed a left vocal fold palsy. A computed tomography scan from the skull base to the thoracic inlet showed no obvious abnormality other than an abducted left vocal cord. The timing of the events and the computed tomography scan results strongly support the conclusion that the left recurrent laryngeal nerve was injured during insertion of the Hickman line, resulting in a left adductor vocal cord palsy."
