  "text": "We present an extremely rare case of an ALK-1-positive pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic lesion of the urinary bladder, which was initially misinterpreted as a low-grade leiomyosarcoma of myxoid subtype on histologic examination owing to prominent atypia, high mitotic activity, abnormal mitotic figures and infiltration of the bladder wall. Although the histologic features were suggestive of a sarcoma, the correct diagnosis was finally established and radical surgical treatment was subsequently avoided. The patient is currently free of disease without any evidence of tumor recurrence or metastasis at 3 years post-operatively."
