  "text": "A 71-year-old man presented with left lower back pain and intermittent claudication accompanied by severe left buttock pain. Radiological examination showed assimilation between the L4 hemivertebra and L5 vertebra, which had two pedicles on the right side, with no canal stenosis. However, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of coronal sections showed extraforaminal stenosis between the L5 transverse process and sacral alar, whereby the L5 spinal nerve was pinched (\"far-out lesion\"), and an abnormal nerve root passage in the assimilated vertebral corpus. We performed transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, then resected the L5 transverse process to decompress the extraforaminal stenosis, and finally installed pedicle screws, but not at the one of pedicles of the assimilated vertebra in order to prevent nerve injury. Postoperatively, the patient had no symptoms up to 1.5Â years after the surgery."
