  "text": "A new Chinese case of ALK-tRCC was reported. The patient was a 58-year-old man with a tumor in kidney. The tumor was composed of sheets of large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders but conspicuous intracytoplasmic vacuoles. The nuclei were enlarged with a nucleolar of grade 4. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were diffusely positive for PAX8, keratin (AE1/AE3), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and CK7. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) showed a rearrangement of ALK in tumor cells."
