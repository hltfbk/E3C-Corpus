  "text": "42 year old male presented with anorexia, nausea, jaundice, pale stools, dark urine and about 35 pound weight loss over the previous 3 weeks. The initial laboratory work was suggestive of cholestatic jaundice. Markedly elevated LDH (2025 U/L) and CA 19-9 (1778 u/ML) were also noticed. The CT scan of abdomen showed massive hepatomegaly with coarse echotexture with contracted gall bladder and normal sized common bile duct. Chest x-ray revealed a mediastinal mass with mediastinal widening. CT scan of the chest showed anterior mediastinal mass (16 cm x 10 cm). CT guided biopsy of the mass showed malignant lymphoma with diffuse proliferation of medium sized lymphoid cells. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD1a, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8 and CD43 with aberrant expression of synaptophysin. PET CT scan again showed a large anterior mediastinal mass with diffuse liver involvement and abnormal activity in axial bones. CT guided liver biopsy and bone marrow biopsy revealed the same morphology and immunohistochemistry. Bone marrow aspirate showed 85% lymphoblasts. Thus, the diagnosis of precursor T-ALL/T-LBL was made and jaundice with elevated CA 19-9 were attributed to intrahepatic cholestasis."
