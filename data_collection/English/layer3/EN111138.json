  "text": "A 60-year-old female was admitted to our department; endoscopy revealed a smooth protruding lesion in the gastric cardia. The patient was diagnosed with a gastric cardia stromal tumor and the lesion was seen in muscularis propria by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) revealed that the lesion was filled with a milky, white liquid and white granulation tissue. Acid-fast specimen staining was negative. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed patches of caseating necrosis and granulomatous inflammation. Gene sequencing subsequent to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the ESD specimen identified Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. TB) DNA fragments. The patient was put on ATT for 6â€‰months."
