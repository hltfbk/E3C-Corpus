  "text": "An 11-year-old female was admitted with the complaints of psoriatic rash on the body associated with severe pain in the lower extremities and arthritis in the right knee. Psoriasis was confirmed by skin biopsy, she diagnosed with juvenile psoriatic arthritis. Diagnostic tests did not indicate any pathology except MRI. MRI of the femur and tibia revealed that high-signal inflammatory changes in the subdermal fascia. These findings led to a diagnosis of psoriatic fasciitis. Methotrexate was given for 3 mo but the patient showed no response to therapy; therefore, etanercept was added. However, there was no response to treatment. Etanercept was switched to adalimumab at the sixth month of therapy. Clinical improvement started with therapy of adalimumab within one month. Fasciitis finding in MRI disappeared at seventh months on adalimumab therapy. She has no complaint for two years with adalimumab."
