  "text": "A 62-year-old caucasian woman presented with recurrent postmenopausal bleeding. She underwent a diagnostic hysteroscopy which showed a large polyp on the posterior uterine wall. Polypectomy was performed and the histological report of the polyp showed a complex adenomatous lesion of uncertain malignant potential. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. The patient is asymptomatic at the time being, and is having annual check ups."
