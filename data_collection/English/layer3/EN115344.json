  "text": "The affected newborn has no spontaneous movement, fractures at birth and respiratory insufficiency. The present case was a Thai male, floppy at birth with fractures of both humeri and femurs and ventilator-dependent respiration. The patient developed bilateral chylothorax two weeks later and died at the age of 6Â weeks. Whole-body postmortem examination with informed consent and genetic analysis of ACTA1 mutation were performed. A skeletal muscle biopsy examined by light and transmission electron microscopy showed the features of nemaline myopathy. ACTA 1 heterozygous missense mutation (c.1127G > C) was identified. Histological examination of both lungs revealed primary pulmonary lymphangiectasia."
