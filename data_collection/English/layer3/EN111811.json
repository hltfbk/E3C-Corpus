  "text": "A 73-year-old known diabetic lady complains of a 6-month history of progressive right ankle pain and swelling over the dorsum of her foot. She did not recall any trauma or twisting injury. She had tenderness over the anterior ankle, an erythematous cystic soft tissue mass, and weakness in ankle dorsiflexion. In addition, she demonstrated notable prominent first metatarsophalangeal hyperextension on ankle dorsiflexion. Loss of contour of normal TA anatomy was noted over anterior aspect of ankle joint. Magnetic resonance imaging reported a complete rupture of the TA tendon with a 4.2 cm tendon gap. Surgical repair using a TA allograft whip stitched side to side to the proximal TA stump and the remaining allograft secured on the medial cuneiform with bio absorbable screw. Rehabilitation consisted of a structured program with protected weight bearing. At 3 months after surgical repair, the patient was able to return to daily activities."
