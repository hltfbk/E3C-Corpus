  "text": "A 67-year-old man presented with a slowly enlarging right cheek mass for 12 years, and the mass began to change in size over a 2-mo time period. Over time, the patient felt mild local pain and right cheek discomfort. His medical history included a hepatitis B virus infection for 20 years and 30 years of smoking. Gross examination of the excised specimen showed a gray-red and gray-white appearance and a soft texture lobulated external surface neoplasm that measured 9 cm × 8 cm × 7 cm and was well circumscribed by relative normal parotid gland tissue. In cross section, the cut surfaces of the neoplasm were multicystic and had a homogeneous scaly appearance. A small fluid was discovered in the cyst. Bilateral oxyphilic, cuboidal or polygonal epithelium cells and lymphoid intraparenchymal components were observed. Many medium- to large-sized lymphoid cells were observed diffusely in part of the neoplasm, and a few secondary lymphoid follicles were observed at the center or edge of the neoplasm. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the columnar oncocytic cells were positive for AE1/AE3; neoplastic cells located in coarctate follicular were positive for CD20, Pax-5, bcl-2 and bcl-6; and the adjacent diffusely medium- to large-sized lymphoid cells were positive for Pax-5, bcl-6, CD20, MUM-1, bcl-2 and CD79a. The bcl-6 (3q27) break-apart rearrangement was observed, and an Epstein Barr virus test was negative in the tumor cells. The patient survived 6 months after being diagnosed without any treatment."
