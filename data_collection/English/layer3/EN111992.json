  "text": "We reported a case of intravascular SFT in a 67-year-old woman who has been experiencing swelling and pain in the right leg for 2â€‰months. Computed tomography venography scan revealed a well-defined mass obstructing the inferior vena cava (IVC). Surgical resection was performed, and histopathologic and immunohistochemical results were consistent with SFT. Further, next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was performed, and results revealed two tumour-related gene mutations (deletion of PMS2 and variation of ESR1 [L536P]). The patient did not receive any adjuvant therapy, and no signs of tumour progression were observed during the 6-month follow-up."
