  "text": "A six year old boy presented with a history of pain and local swelling over his third metacarpal of five months' duration. Physical and radiographic examination of the hand was consistent with aneurysmal bone cyst. After biopsy, pathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cyst. En- block resection of the tumor and autologous fibular strut graft fixation with Kirschner wires was performed. The hand was immobilized in a short arm cast for three weeks; after the patient received three weeks of physiotherapy, the kirschner wires were removed six weeks postoperatively. Excellent clinical and functional results were obtained with no recurrence after two years of follow-up with en-block resection and reconstruction by autologous graft."
