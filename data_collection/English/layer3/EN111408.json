  "text": "A 52-year-old Japanese woman sought medical attention at our hospital for lower abdominal pain. A 27-cm uterine mass was detected on clinical imaging, with a 78 × 47-mm mass in the right atrium detected on preoperative echocardiography. Intracardiac mass resection and tricuspid annuloplasty were performed as the first-stage surgery. The pedicle of the tumor was adherent to the wall of the atrium. On histological examination, the tumor was found to consist of spindle-shaped cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, without atypia, but with a myxoid change, and rich microvascularization of the pedicle. Total abdominal hysterectomy was performed as the second-stage surgery, with confirmation of the diagnosis as uterine intravenous leiomyomatosis with an isolated metastasic lesion to the right atrium. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence in the 15 months since surgery."
