  "text": "A 45-year-old male patient was transported with brain abscess in the subcortical white matter. Navigation-guided abscess aspiration and drainage was performed in the right mid-frontal lobe, but the symptoms continued to worsen after the procedure. A panoramic radiograph showed alveolar bone resorption around the maxillary molars. The compromised maxillary molars were extracted under local anesthesia, and antibiotics were applied based on findings from bacterial culture. A brain MRI confirmed that the three brain abscesses in the frontal lobe were reduced in size, and the patient's symptoms began to improve after the extractions."
