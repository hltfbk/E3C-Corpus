  "text": "A 59-year-old patient consulted us for hearing loss, tinnitus and left otorrhea for one year. The patient had no dizziness or otalgia. He did not have a history of sinonasal pathology or surgery. Otoscopy revealed posterior perforation filled by irregular budding neoformation. The latter bleeds on contact. The contralateral ear was healthy. The rhinological examination was normal. The audiogram was in favor of a left hearing deafness of 50 db.\nThe temporal CT scan showed tissue filling the tympanic cavity as well as the mastoid antrum without bone lysis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a tissue process occupying the left middle ear in T1 and T2 isosignal and taking the contrast medium.\nThe patient had a closed technique tympanoplasty. Perioperatively, the tympanic cavity and the mastoid were filled with polypoid tissue bleeding on contact. The orifice of the Eustachian tube was free. There is no bone lysis. An intraoperative biopsy of this polypoid tissue was made and the anatomopathological examination returned to the criteria corresponding to an inverted papilloma with papillae and epithelial invaginations, sometimes covered by a transitional type epithelium sometimes of keratinized squamous type. There were no signs of malignancy. Computed tomography of the facial plate in search of nasolabial localization was normal. The evolution was marked by the installation of a left otorrhea 4 months after the first surgery. The control MRI was in favor of recurrence. The patient was reoperated. He had a tympanoplasty in open technique. There was no recurrence after 30 months of surveillance."
