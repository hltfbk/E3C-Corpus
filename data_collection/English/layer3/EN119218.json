  "text": "A healthy 67-year-old woman was admitted for investigation of a pulmonary mass found on a routine X-ray. She had a history of breast cancer diagnosed and treated 13 years previously with left mastectomy followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy. No progression of the disease was reported. Thoracic computer tomography disclosed a soft-tissue mass in the lower lobe of the left lung arising in the vicinity of the pleura. No abnormal lymph nodes were noted. Further work-up for metastases was negative. Subsequently, the lower lobe of the left lung was removed and the diagnosis was a monophasic synovial sarcoma."
