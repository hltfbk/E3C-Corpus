  "text": "A 28-year-old Caucasian male presented repeatedly with urinary retention. First, he was misdiagnosed with alcohol-induced urinary retention and later with benign prostatic hyperplasia. After the appearance of new symptoms, including hematuria and hydronephrosis, endoscopic and radiographic evaluation was performed. Transurethral biopsy of the prostate secured the diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma. The symptoms receded under chemotherapy and complete remission of the disease was established."
