  "text": "A 65-year-old woman who had split-graft deceased-donor LT for primary biliary cirrhosis developed fever, dyspnea and dry coughing at 25â€‰months after transplant. Her immunosuppressants included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. PCP infection was confirmed by molecular detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii,in bronchoalveolar lavage. On day-10 trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, her chest X-ray showed subcutaneous emphysema bilaterally, right pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. Computed tomography of the thorax confirmed the presence of right pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. She was managed with 7-day right-sided chest drain and a 21-day course of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole before discharge."
