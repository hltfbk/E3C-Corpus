  "text": "A 60-year-old, white female with a history of intermittent proteinuria was referred by her primary care physician for renal dysfunction. Biopsy confirmed FSGS and she was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. She also had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but no active synovitis and was maintained on prednisone 5 mg/d. She also complained of worsening vision in her right eye and was diagnosed with optic neuritis (ON). She remained stable for about 8 months when examination indicated FSGS relapse, and she reported painful RA flares. She was treated with Acthar(Â®) Gel (40 mg biweekly) for 6 months, after which proteinuria and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio decreased to about half. Her ON improved, and she reported that she had fewer RA flares and pain improved by 50%. This case of confirmed FSGS showed an improved response to treatment with Acthar Gel for FSGS with concomitant RA and ON."
