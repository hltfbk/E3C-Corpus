  "text": "A healthy 26-year-old man presented a thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus during recent intensive training for a triathlon. Investigation at the time found no drug or anabolic steroid consumption, or any hematologic or coagulation disturbance. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated for 10 months with good outcome. One year later, soon after returning to intensive exercise, mainly running, the patient presented a thrombosis of the straight sinus complicated by bithalamic hyperintensities observed on T2 magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Anticoagulation treatment was reinitiated and led to repermeabilization of the cerebral vein and reversibility of thalamic abnormalities. Four months later, the patient was free of headache and had no cognitive impairment. He continues to practice intensive sport with vitamin K antagonist as preventive treatment."
