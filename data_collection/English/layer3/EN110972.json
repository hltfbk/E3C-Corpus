  "text": "Herein, we present the case of a 35-year-old woman with diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma and rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM). She was a candidate for enucleation of the left eye, orbital decompression, and sinocerebral debridement. Nevertheless, the patient refused eye enucleation and craniotomy. Finally, she was treated with a combination of antifungals and sinus debridement without eye enucleation and craniotomy."
