  "text": "A 64-year-old British woman experienced recurrent positional posterior dislocation after primary hip replacement, particularly when involved in activities involving unsafe flexion of the operated hip. She disliked using an abduction brace and hence was given a simple 'flexion reminder device' that could be strapped to the thigh. Beyond the safe flexion limit, the padded top end of the device hitched against the groin crease and reminded her not to flex further, to avoid dislocation. She experienced no discomfort in wearing the device continuously throughout the day and was very satisfied. She has had no further dislocations in the 2 years since she began using it."
