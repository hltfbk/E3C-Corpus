  "text": "Nine months after endovascular treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (abdominal stent graft), a 76-year-old man was admitted for severe abdominal pain radiating to the back. Laboratory tests were normal apart from elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Injected abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed infiltration of the fat tissues around the aortic endoprosthesis and aneurysmal sac expansion; positron emission tomography with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro- D-glucose integrated with computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) showed a hypermetabolic mass in contact with the endoprosthesis. Blood cultures were negative. At surgical revision, an infra-renal peri-aortic abscess was evident; post-operative antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin and doxycycline was started. Cultures of intraoperative samples were positive for L. monocytogenes. Results were further confirmed by a broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing. Antibiotic treatment was switched to intravenous amoxicillin for 6 weeks. Evolution was uneventful with decrease of inflammatory parameters and regression of the abscess."
