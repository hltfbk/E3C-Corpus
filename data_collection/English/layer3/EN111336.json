  "text": "A 52-year-old man developed acute arm swelling 2â€‰days after creation of a left arm brachio-basilic arteriovenous graft. The axillary vein was found to be jailed by a previously deployed cephalic arch stent graft which had migrated into the subclavian vein. There was failure to cross through the fabric of the stent graft using conventional chronic total occlusion wires and techniques. A TruePath device was used successfully to cross through the fabric of migrated cephalic arch stent graft and recanalise the short subclavian-axillary vein occlusion."
