  "text": "73 year-old male patient was admitted to our clinic complaining of headache. He was examined in clinical followup. In his physical examination, there was no motor deficit and also loss of balance, gait disturbance and sensory deficit were not inspected. Cranial CT was taken after a detailed physical examination and a mass was seen in 4 th ventricle. After CT, MRI was performed and presence of mass was confirmed. We performed a cranial surgery with transcortical approach and the mass was completely removed. Pathology specimen was diagnosed as choroid plexus carcinoma which was rarely seen in this age group."
