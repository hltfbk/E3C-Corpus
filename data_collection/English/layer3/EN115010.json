  "text": "A 72-year-old Asian female with rheumatoid arthritis was admitted for high grade fever and walking difficulty with severe lumbago. Initially, we suspected lumber compression fracture with deterioration of rheumatoid arthritis, but Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from blood culture during hospitalization. The isolated organism was identified as S. moniliformis by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing. S. moniliformis is well known to be a primary causative organism of rat bite fever, but this patient had no history of rat bite. Had S. moniliformis bacteremia not been detected, she might have been treated for rheumatic exacerbation."
