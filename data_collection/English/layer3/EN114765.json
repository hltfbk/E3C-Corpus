  "text": "Two patients presented with non-infectious re-deterioration of Rathke's cleft cysts with intraparenchymal infiltration and marked cerebral edema, to ipsilateral hypothalamus in one case and to the bilateral frontal lobes in the other. Both patients were surgically treated by extended transsphenoidal surgery, and showed remarkable improvement with postoperative pulse-dose steroid therapy, including disappearance/shrinkage of abnormal enhanced lesion and cerebral edema on magnetic resonance imaging. Histological examination disclosed significant squamous metaplasia in epithelia and marked infiltration of inflammatory cells into the pituitary gland and neuroglial tissues. Most infiltrated cells were lymphocytes and plasma cells, thought to indicate the involvement of long-term underling inflammatory processes in this phenomenon."
