  "text": "A 23-year-old lady in her first pregnancy developed Anti-D antibodies at 28 weeks of gestation without any known sensitising event. In view of increasing anti-D titres, at 36 weeks she was delivered. Incidentally during caesarean section she was found to have bicornuate uterus. The neonate was treated with phototherapy and blood transfusion following delivery."
