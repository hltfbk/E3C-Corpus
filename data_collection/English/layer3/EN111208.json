  "text": "The first patient was a 67-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. He had no history of laparotomy or abdominal injury. Computed tomography suggested small bowel obstruction and possible intestinal strangulation. Emergent laparoscopy found approximately 200â€‰cm of small bowel was strangulated around the greater omentum. The strangulation was released laparoscopically, but because of the color of the strangulated bowel, laparotomy was performed to evaluate viability. The involved portion of intestine was not resected. The patient experienced transient postoperative paralytic ileus and was discharged on postoperative day 14. The second patient was a 56-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography revealed dilatation of the small intestine and a closed loop suggesting ileus due to intestinal strangulation. An emergency laparoscopy found a transomental hernia, and the strangulation was released laparoscopically. Recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6."
