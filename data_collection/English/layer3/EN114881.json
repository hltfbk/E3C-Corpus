  "text": "A 55-year-old male complained of dysphasia for 4 weeks and continuous deterioration for 5 days. Cerebral infarction was considered based on MRI, which showed hyperintensity at the border zone of the left hemisphere, and computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed left carotid artery severe stenosis. The patient underwent placement of a left carotid artery stent, and his symptoms recurred 2 months after carotid artery stent (CAS). MRI showed multiple ring-enhanced lesions in the left temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes accompanied by massive brain edema. The final pathologic diagnosis was glioblastoma multiforme."
