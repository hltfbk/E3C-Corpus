  "text": "A 66-year-old female complained of a huge neck mass on the right side that had started growing 3 months previously and was associated with compressive and B symptoms. She had undergone left hemithyroidectomy 20 years previously. On examination, a huge neck mass measuring 10 Ã— 6 cm was detected on the right side that had shifted the trachea to the contralateral side. CT scanning revealed a huge soft tissue mass in the neck with compressive signs. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) showed variably sized lymphocytes and large epithelial cells with occasional atypical cells. Tissue biopsy revealed DBCL, which is suggestive of PTL."
