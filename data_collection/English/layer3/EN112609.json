  "text": "Three patients were referred to our hospital because abdominal pain and vomiting suddenly occurred. Acute MAGV was diagnosed by upper gastrointestinal study. After overnight gastric decompression with a nasal tube, the GV was resolved spontaneously. Elective SILG was planned. Single incision at the umbilicus was made and three 5-mm trocars were inserted. The anterior wall of the body of the stomach was sutured to the peritoneum using 6 × 4-0 non-absorbable sutures for prevention of recurrence of GV and occurrence of internal hernia through the space created between the sutures. Two boys and a girl with mean age 4 ± 2 years underwent SILG. The mean time of the operation was 48 ± 23 min. All of the procedures were completed safely, and there were no postoperative complications. The mean time of postoperative hospitalization was 4 ± 1 days. All patients had good cosmetic and clinical results."
