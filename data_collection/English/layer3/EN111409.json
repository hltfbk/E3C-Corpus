  "text": "A 69-year-old woman who was diagnosed with type 4 stage IV gastric cancer with PALM underwent five courses of NAC with the SOX+HER regimen. The primary tumor and the PALM shrank after treatment, suggesting that the NAC induced a partial response. We performed a total gastrectomy plus distal pancreaticosplenectomy with para-aortic lymph node dissection. Histological analysis revealed no remnant cancer cells in the primary tumor or the lymph nodes, confirming a pCR. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 14 after the operation. S-1 was started as adjuvant chemotherapy, and the patient remains alive without recurrence 2â€‰months after surgery."
