  "text": "A 48-year-old female presented to our clinic with complaints of persistent low back and swelling 1 month after sustaining a fall from stand resulting in an L5 transverse process fracture. The patient was treated non-operatively but continued to have swelling noted to the lower back. A computed tomography scan demonstrated a large subcutaneous fluid collection measuring 15 cm×16 cm×7 cm centralized over the lower lumbar region. We elected to proceed with operative evacuation of the fluid collection. A 2 cm midline incision over the proximal aspect of the fluid collection was made and approximately 900 ml of serosanguinous fluid was evacuated. The cavity was then irrigated with a normal saline 0.9%/betadine solution and a wound vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) sponge was placed. The post-operative course was unremarkable and the wound VAC was discontinued at the first post-operative visit. The surgical incision went on to heal uneventfully with no signs of infection or fluid reaccumulation."
