  "text": "We are reporting a case of a 27-year-old female with breast cancer who has been treated with dose-dense chemotherapy and received colony-stimulating factor as primary prevention of febrile neutropenia that was complicated halfway through with splenic infarction. This finding was confirmed by computed tomography (CT) scan and splenic biopsy. Management was conservative without the need of surgical intervention."
