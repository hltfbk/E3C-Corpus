  "text": "A 44 year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of fever and malaise after returning from Nigeria. A blood film was positive for Plasmodium falciparum. His creatinine was 616 µmol/L coming from a normal baseline of 89 µmol/L. He had a urine protein:creatinine ratio of 346 mg/mmol (4.4 g/L). He required dialysis. A renal biopsy showed acute interstitial nephritis with podocyte foot-process effacement. He was treated with artesunate and his renal function improved. At 1 year follow-up his creatinine had plateaued at 120 µmol/L with persistent low-grade proteinuria."
