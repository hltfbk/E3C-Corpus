  "text": "The patient was a 22-year-old soccer player who has presented with a direct shoulder traumatism that is causing persistent pain and impairment. Early appropriate imaging was done (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and arthro-computed tomography scan); it revealed an isolated tear of the TM at the myotendinous junction. Open surgical repair was performed through a posterior approach, within the 1st month after the injury. The patient was immobilized for 1 month in neutral rotation and then was allowed to begin the rehabilitation process. At the 2-year follow-up point, the patient had a pain-free and functional shoulder, allowing a return to full activities, including sport at the pre-injury level. MRI confirmed that the muscle had healed, without atrophy or fatty infiltration."
