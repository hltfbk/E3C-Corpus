  "text": "A 19 years old girl from the remote village of Nepal presented with the history of exercise intolerance associated with cyanosis and clubbing of the extremities. We diagnosed her as a case of right pulmonary artery to left atrial fistula, a rare variant of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. She underwent successful surgical correction of the anomaly under cardiopulmonary bypass surgery."
