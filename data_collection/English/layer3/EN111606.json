  "text": "We present the case of an 8-year-old girl with osteosarcoma of the distal femur without involvement of the epiphysis. Epiphyseal distraction was applied to separate the epiphysis and metaphysis, and this provided a safe surgical margin. The massive bone defect was reconstructed with a custom-made antibiotic-loaded polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) construct combined with a free non-vascularized fibular graft. Six months after surgery, bone union between the autograft and host bone was confirmed in both the proximal and distal femur by computer tomography (CT) examination. Moreover, considerable callus formation was found around the PMMA construct. After 28 mo of follow-up, there was no sign of recurrence or metastasis. The patient could walk without any aid and carry out her daily life activities satisfactorily."
