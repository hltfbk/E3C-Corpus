  "text": "A 74-year-old woman presented with epigastric pain and jaundice for 3 days. Computed tomography revealed diffuse dilatation of the biliary tree, with multiple intrahepatic duct and common bile duct (CBD) stones, in addition to situs inversus totalis. ERCP was performed twice for CBD stone to remove the CBD stones using two techniques. For the first technique used, the patient was placed in a prone position with the endoscopist on the right side of the table. First, the endoscope was rotated 180° counterclockwise in the stomach, and was then shortened by turning 180° the counterclockwise again in the duodenum. For the second technique, we assessed the second portion of the duodenum by following the lesser curvature, while slowly turning the endoscope clockwise."
