  "text": "We describe the case of a patient with severe pan-enteritis presenting with life-threatening diarrhoea complicated with hypovolemic shock and acute kidney injury after colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) for UC; this patient was successfully treated by ileostomy closure after failing to achieve full remission with corticosteroid therapy. Next, we review other cases of post-colectomy enteritis reported in the literature and propose a flow-chart for its diagnosis and initial treatment."
