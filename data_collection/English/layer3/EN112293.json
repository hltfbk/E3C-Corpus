  "text": "A man in his 50s who was diagnosed as having two foci of HCC and advanced liver cirrhosis was referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment. Both foci of HCC were located in segment 8 of the liver and measured 39 and 9 mm. Endoscopy showed esophageal varices that had a high risk of bleeding. After endoscopic ligation of the esophageal varices, he underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for downstaging of the advanced HCCs. No further liver deterioration was observed after TACE, and HCC staging was successfully downstaged to within the Milan criteria. One hundred ten days after TACE, he underwent liver transplantation; at 2.5 years after transplantation, he remains alive without HCC recurrence."
