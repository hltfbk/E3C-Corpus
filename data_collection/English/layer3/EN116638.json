  "text": "A 32 year-old African-Ugandan woman presented with complaints of a mass protruding per anus for 2 weeks. It was reducible and associated with colicky abdominal pain, loose stools, and bloody-mucoid discharge per anus. She had previously had a one and a half month's history of abdominal pain; periodically continuous, while other times colicky in character. Examination and investigations revealed an intussusception with a partial intestinal obstruction. At laparotomy she was found to have an ileo-colic intussusception with a freely mobile colon throughout its length. There were persistent ascending and descending mesocolons, and absent hepatocolic and splenocolic ligaments. The intussusceptum was 'milked' but not completely reducible. A right hemicolectomy was done, with ileo-transverse colonic anastomosis. Histopathological examination revealed no preexisting pathologic lesion as a lead point."
