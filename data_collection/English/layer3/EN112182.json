  "text": "We report the case of a 29-year-old woman with chronic hepatitis C infection - elevated transaminases, positive serology. HCV was detectable on two occasions, and histology showed mild disease - A1F1. Upon follow up and without any treatment, the patient achieved spontaneous clearance confirmed by two consecutive undetectable HCV RNA tests. Spontaneous HCV clearance rarely occurs - 0.5% per person-year. This is sometimes accompanied by special circumstances like additional disease or medical interventions. Host factors like gender and interleukin-28B polymorphisms have been known to contribute to clearance. Viral factors like HCV RNA levels are also a factor. The characteristics of host-viral interplay - age of acquisition and fibrosis stage - cannot be overlooked."
