  "text": "We report the case of an 82-year-old white man presenting with massive rectal bleeding after ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy. Medical and endoscopic management were not effective. Angiographic evaluation revealed a prostatic arteriovenous fistula, and definitive treatment was provided in the form of catheter-directed superselective embolotherapy."
