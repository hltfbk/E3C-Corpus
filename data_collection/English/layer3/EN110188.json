  "text": "The first Vaginoplasty using skin grafts was in 1898 Abbe [4] used a rubber pouch covered with a skin graft and stuffed with iodoform gauze to create a neovagina. In 1938 Mclndoe and Banister [5] re-introduced and popularized this technique. The technique we used was repairing vaginal stenosis by interposing between the vaginal walls, a skin flap pedicled removed using the Falandry technique at a high lip [6].\nThe patient is under spinal anesthesia. Perforators from the posterior labial artery were mapped at the lateral base of the labium major. One labial flap was designed based on those perforators\nAfter a skin incision, one labial border flap was elevated in advance as local flaps, and turned backwards.\nThe flap was appointed to form the posterior wall, creating a vaginal lumen of adequate size.\nThe patient was re-examined three weeks after the surgical act, it is satisfied sexually. After a decline of 3 months, there has been no recurrence."
