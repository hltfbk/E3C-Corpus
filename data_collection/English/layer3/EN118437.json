  "text": "A 13-year-old, white male, was operatively treated by intertrochanteric osteotomy of valgisation, anterotation and extension at age of twelve years because of leg length discrepancy, changes in the femoral neck, coxa vara, plana and breva. It was delay in diagnosis and failure to begin treatment promptly in the neonatal period."
