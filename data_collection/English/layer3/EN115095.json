  "text": "We report a case of 41-year-old man with a history of 2 months' headache and sudden exacerbation for 3 days. Radiology examination suggested multiple lesions spreading along ventricular system. Laboratory tests showed exceeding increase of serum CA 199. The patient underwent craniotomy and continuous lumber drainage. Post-operative pathology proved a ruptured intracranial epidermoid cyst. MRI scans and serum CA 199 were closely followed up for three years."
