  "text": "An eighty-nine-year-old male fell off a ladder at home and presented with an acute traumatic cervical spine trauma, which we believe involved a distraction mechanism. The patient was neurologically intact; he denied any weakness, numbness or paresthesia. A preoperative CT-scan demonstrated a posterior dislocation with an anterior arch of C1 fracture. Conservative management was elected. Reduction was achieved by closed manual reduction under general anesthesia. A postoperative CT demonstrated a complete reduction of the atlanto-axial dislocation."
