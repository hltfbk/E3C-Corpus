  "text": "A 32-year-old G3P3002 African woman presented with increasing abdominal distension and 1 day of worsening abdominal pain and vomiting. Her previous pregnancy had ended 6 years prior with a stillborn baby delivered by Cesarean hysterectomy after laboring at home for 1 day. At the time of current presentation, this patient was confused and irritable, with an undetectable blood pressure, tachycardia, labored breathing, and a distended and tender abdomen. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin was positive and a transabdominal ultrasound showed significant intraperitoneal fluid collections and a singleton, viable pregnancy consistent with 13 weeks of gestation. A diagnosis of hypovolemic shock secondary to ruptured ectopic pregnancy was made, and she underwent emergency laparotomy. Intraoperative findings included 4.5 liters of hemoperitoneum and a cervical stump pregnancy with active bleeding from a partially detached placental site."
