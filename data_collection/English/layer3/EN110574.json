  "text": "A 29-year-old judo player, having no pathological history consulted for instability of the left knee following a sports accident two months ago. The patient reported that, since traumatism, he had intermittent claudication occurring after walking and during re-education sessions, especially during the reinforcement muscle exercises. Examination of the knee showed anterior laxity. There was no meniscal syndrome and the peripheral pulses were present. MRI of the knee showed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. The popliteal artery was laminated and trapped between the gastrocnemius muscle and the medial condyle. CT angiography showed a partial occlusion of the popliteal artery due to a popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES), with a pathway in the inter-condylar notch, flush with the femoral footprint of the native ACL. This made it difficult to drill the femoral tunnel for ACL reconstruction. The patient was warned that this situation represents a risk of popliteal artery injury during arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The patient was operated on by a vascular surgeon: he had a releasing of the trapped vessel by myomectomy. ACL reconstruction was postponed. After six months, the patient had no vascular claudication."
