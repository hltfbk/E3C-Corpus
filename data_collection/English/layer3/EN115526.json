  "text": "A 13 year old girl presented with pain and swelling of the (R) leg since 2 months following a trivial injury at school. Examination revealed a 5Ã—3cm tender swelling on the anteromedial aspect of the middle third tibia. Radiographs and MRI, revealed an eccentric expansile lytic lesion, which was multilocular and was present at the junction of the metaphysis and diaphysis on the antero -medial aspect of tibia. The cortex had ballooned out and there was a possibility of an impending fracture. Biopsy was done which revealed osteofibrous dysplasia. We did an extraperiosteal excision of the lesion. To fill the cavity we harvested 10 cm of the contralateral fibula and since there was still space in the cavity, we packed bone graft substitute (hydroxyapatite crystals) into the defect. The surgical management of osteofibrous dysplasia is controversial. Various methods of treatment of such cases have been described in literature. The use of synthetic graft is an option in these patients as it reduces morbidity; and in our case we had good graft incorporation with this method."
