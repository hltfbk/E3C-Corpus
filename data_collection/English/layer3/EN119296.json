  "text": "A 57-years-old male patient has been complaining of abdominal distention, weight lose, and hematuria. During physical examination, significant distention and multiple palpable tumor masses were identified on the abdomen. Abdominal computed tomography showed multiple, well-defined, soft tissue masses with homogenous and heterogeneous pattern, in the mesenteric and retroperitoneal areas. Unlike specific features of gastrointestinal stromal tumor, renal obstruction and atypical central calcification without chemotherapy that has not been yet described were seen in this case. Computed tomography did not reveal liver metastases and/or the lymph nodes with pathological size. Ultrasonography-guided true-cut biopsy was made, histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated stromal tumor which, C-KIT (+). The patient underwent left ureterectomy, left nephrectomy and total colectomy. Postoperative histopathological analyses revealed lower grade malignant GISTs. As of 17 months after the surgery, he is alive and free of recurrence."
