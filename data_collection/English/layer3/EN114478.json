  "text": "We report the case of a 71-year-old female patient who presented with recurrent upper abdominal pain. A CT-scan demonstrated a heterogenous mass in the liver hilum. Liver function tests and hematology parameters as well as the tumor markers were normal. Due to the unclear diagnosis a percutaneous biopsy of this mass was performed and revealed leiomyosarcoma. The patient was treated by a right sided hemihepatectomy with portal vein reconstruction and an end-to-side hepatico-jejunostomy. Final histology confirmed complete (R0) resection of a moderately differentiated leiomyosarcoma of the portal vein. After complete (R0) resection of the lesion, the patient remained without any signs of tumor recurrence for a total of 36Â months until detection of an unresectable local recurrence. After surgical re-exploration the patient was finally referred to palliative radiotherapy."
