  "text": "The patient was a 35-year-old man, admitted with objection of abdominal pain. A nasogastric tube was inserted and fixed that resulted in drainage of about 500cc dark blood. He was candidate for emergent endoscopy due to upper GIB. During resuscitation measures, he suddenly developed respiratory distress that could not be justified by upper GIB alone. Therefore, bedside sonography discovered some soft tissue apart from lung tissue in the left hemithorax. After performing diagnostic measures, with diagnosis of diaphragmatic herniation and strangulation he underwent emergent surgery."
