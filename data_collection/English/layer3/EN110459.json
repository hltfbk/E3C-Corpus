  "text": "Case presentation 1: a 28-year-old female patient was diagnosed with comminuted mandible fracture on left side. She sustained the injury after falling from a height when she climbed up a tree for harvesting fruits. She presented with fracture in symphysis region also. She was opted for open reduction as the wound was infected when she reported to the hospital and closed reduction would not have been suitable for the type of fracture. Patient was treated under general anaesthesia and surgical procedure was carried out as described. Intra-operative pictures show excellent access to the fracture fragment which was enough to reduce them and place 3 miniplates. Case presentation 2: a 21-year-old male suffered isolated mandibular angle fracture following a road traffic accident. Patient in this case wanted early return to the work and also on CT scan a torsional deformation was seen on the fracture fragments. Hence the decision to do open reduction was made. Incision designing and access ad procedure was carried out as described. Access was satisfactory and 2 miniplates were placed and fixation achieved. Surgical procedure: both the above-mentioned patients were treated under general anaesthesia. Thiopentone sodium was used for induction and patients were intubated nasally. Oral cavity was kept free to achieve maxillo-mandibular fixation and achieve the occlusion. Isoflurane and/or sevoflurane were used for maintenance. Surgical site and incision line were marked with a marking ink before commencing the procedure. Thereafter the marked line was infiltrated using lidocaine with adrenaline in 1:1000 concentrations. Incision remains the key of this approach as aesthetics has been given prime importance to the designing of this surgical access. Care has to be taken that incision follows the curvature of the angle of the mandible and suture line has to be visualized beforehand such that it is hidden completely in the shadow of the angle. Incision can be said to be combination of postramal Hind's incision and submandibular Risdon's incision but to the fact that it remains closer to the angle of the mandible, around 1 cm away from the bony landmark completely in the shadow of the mandible. Sharp incision with a 15 number blade is imperative to avoid any jagged incision line. In the first stroke only skin and subcutaneous tissue should be visible and skin flaps hold tightly away with skin hooks, which gives clear view of the subcutaneous tissue. Platysma muscle once seen can be dissected easily with a pair of scissors and blade with care that the superficial layer of deep cervical fascia is left undisturbed. Further careful progression and perhaps the most challenging step is dissecting through the deep cervical fascia which is important because the facial nerve, facial artery and facial vein will be lying deep to the fascia and hence absolute care has to be taken while incising the deep fascia. Immediately after incising the deep fascia, it is of utmost importance to identify the facial nerve with the nerve stimulator and retracting it in the upper flap. Subsequently, facial artery and vein should be identified, and if necessary, should be ligated and retracted to expose the underlying pterygo-masseteric sling. Once the pterygo-masseteric sling is visible then it becomes fairly easy procedure, whereby sharp incision on the sling can be given to expose the mandibular angle and this plane is fairly avascular with not much bleeding. Once the angle is exposed, fracture fragments can be easily manipulated to achieve reduction. Miniplates can be placed thereafter and fixation achieved. After irrigating the surgical site, closure is achieved in layers to define anatomic spaces. Great care was taken to achieve skin closure wherein subcutaneous horizontal mattress suturing was done to achieve the skin approximation which gives excellent post-operative scar. In both the treated cases, no suture tracks were noticed and a linear scar within the mandibular angle shadow was seen which was almost inconspicuous at the conversational distance."
