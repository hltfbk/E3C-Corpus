  "text": "We present a case of a 41-year-old white woman with cyclic rectal bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging was done, together with colonoscopy and histologic staining of biopsied samples, which led to the final diagnosis of intestinal invasive endometriosis with recto-sigmoid stricture. Our patient was treated symptomatically with stool softeners."
