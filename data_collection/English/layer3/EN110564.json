Timeline: presented same day of incident and was placed on a backlsab splint. Diagnostic assessment: diagnostic methods -MRI of the right knee performed revealed discontinuity of the distal quadriceps' tendon 6.4mm proximal to the superior pole of the patella with mal orientation of the fibers. Retraction was also noted posteriorly. There was also partial tears of the vastus medialis and lateralis components with subcutaneous edema as well as partial tear of the patellofemoral ligament. MRI of the left knee showed partial discontinuity of the distal quadriceps' tendon, 11mm proximal to the superior pole of the patella. Partial tears of the vastus medialis and lateralis components and the medial patellofemoral ligament was also noted. Diagnostic challenges. clinical index of suspicion. Diagnosis (including other diagnoses considered). This confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral quadriceps tendon tear as well as radiological diagnosis of partial tear of the patellofemoral ligament. Therapeutic intervention: he was counselled for and subsequently underwent surgical tendon repair using Krakow method of tendon repair. Exposure of the ruptured tendon revealed full thickness rupture at the superior pole of the patella, Surgical repair was followed by immobilization and rehabilitation with the help of the physiotherapist.
