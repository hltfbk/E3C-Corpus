  "text": "A 4-year-old boy was referred to the Emergency Paediatric Unit of the hospital with the complaint of forehead swelling of a day duration. He sustained the injury while being beaten by the paternal Uncle's wife (which she initially denied). Further enquiries revealed that the child had been subjected to physical abuse in the preceding few weeks, during which he had a right clavicular fracture. He also sustained hot water scald burns injury close to the location of the clavicular fracture. The boy had lost his father about three months before presentation and was relocated to the paternal uncle and his wife as the new caregivers. At presentation, he was conscious with forehead swelling measuring about 8 cm x 8 cm, soft, fluctuant, tender and darkish discolouration around the lower part of the eyes (Panda eyes sign). He also had swelling over the right clavicle, hard and tender with an area of healing scald burns injury (about 6 cm x 5 cm) lateral to it, multiple bruises at various stages of healing and ‘rope marks ' over the back and extremities. The other systemic examinations findings were not remarkable.\nThe X-ray of the shoulder showed right clavicular fracture with callus formation. The computerised tomography scan of the cranium showed frontal scalp haematoma and normal intracranial findings. A diagnosis of battered child syndrome was made; he was admitted and placed on analgesia and antibiotics. The orthopaedic surgeons reviewed and opted to manage the fractures conservatively (non-operative). Social welfare department traced the home, got the community leaders involved, and a report was also made to the law enforcement agents. The child was discharged home on the fifth day and allowed to be reunited with his biological mother. Before being reunited with the mother (a week after discharge), a regular home visit was carried out by the social welfare who confirmed the cessation of further abuse. Furthermore, the boy was also seen on a scheduled clinical appointment with no evidence of further abuse."
