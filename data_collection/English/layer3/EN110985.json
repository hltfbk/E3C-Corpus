  "text": "An 80-year-old woman had invasive lobular cancer of the left breast (cT1 [1.7 cm], cN0, M0) for which she underwent breast-conservative surgery and biopsy of an axillary sentinel lymph node. Because two of the three sentinel lymph nodes tested positive for cancer, seven lateral axillary lymph nodes (level I) were subsequently removed for the additional sampling. On postoperative day 11, the patient visited our outpatient clinic because of swelling in her left axillary region and breast. Centesis of the axilla yielded 670 mL of milky fluid, which suggested chyle leakage. We commenced the conservative management at first; however, the persistent leakage made us perform the surgical management. The operation was not only ligating the opening of the chyle duct but needed total mastectomy because the postoperative pathology report showed invasive lobular carcinoma; the nipple and the caudal surgical margin of the lumpectomy were positive for cancer. The patient agreed to our recommendation of total mastectomy and surgical management of the chyle leakage. Ligation of the opening completely resolved the chylous discharge."
