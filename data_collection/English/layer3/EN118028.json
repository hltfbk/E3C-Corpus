  "text": "An otherwise well 46-year-old woman presented to her general practitioner with intermittent abdominal pain that had been present for several months. The only abnormality found at the initial consultation was moderate tenderness in the right upper abdomen. The laboratory tests that were ordered showed elevated parameters of inflammation. Sonography suggested the presence of an echinococcal cyst in segment VIII of the liver. Computed tomography confirmed this finding and showed no other cysts. On the basis of serological tests and the clinical findings, a diagnosis of Echinococcus granulosus infection was made. The patient was therefore admitted to hospital for surgical removal of the cyst. Her postoperative recovery was without complication and she remained free of symptoms."
