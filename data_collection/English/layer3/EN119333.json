  "text": "We present here, a case of a 66-year-old patient with intestinal GIST and a synchronous colorectal adenocarcinoma discovered incidentally during surgical treatment of the recurrent GIST. Immunohistochemical examination revealed the concurrence of histologically proved GIST (strongly positive staining for c-kit, vimentin, SMA, and focal positive in S-100, while CD-34 was negative) and Dukes Stage C, (T3, N3, M0 according the TNM staging classification of colorectal cancer)."
