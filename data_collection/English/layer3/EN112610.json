  "text": "A 61-year-old Chinese woman experienced recurrent right-sided chest pain and transient syncope. A significant decrease in her hemoglobin level and thick bloody pleural fluid demonstrated spontaneous hemothorax. The elevated serum IgG4 and histopathological analysis of the right pleura and intercostal lymph node specimens all supported the diagnosis of IgG4-RD in this patient. Further diagnostic evaluation did not reveal other causes for spontaneous hemothorax. She received steroids and no recurrent bleeding event occurred during a follow-up period of more than 1â€‰year."
