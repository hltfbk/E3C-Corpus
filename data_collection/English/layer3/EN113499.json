  "text": "Presented is the case of a 46-year old patient with an acute exacerbation of Graves' ophthalmopathy. Clinically apparent was a convergent strabismus fixus with severe hypotropia of both eyes. The patient suffered from attacks of heavy retrobulbar pain and eyesight deteriorated dramatically. Since neither systemic glucocorticoid therapy nor orbital decompression surgery had helped to halt the progress of the disease, a decision was made in favour of the surgical release and repositioning of the inferior and medial rectus muscle as a final therapeutic option. Surgery of both eyes was performed consecutively within one week. Detailed descriptions and illustrations of the surgical steps and treatment outcome are provided supplemented by a discussion of the current literature."
