  "text": "A 21-years-woman was referred to the division of nephrology for a nephrotic syndrome. She received a percutaneous ultrasound -guided renal biopsy to determine the cause of nephrotic syndrome. About 4 hours after the biopsy, the patient developed massive gross haematuria and urinary clot retention.On examination, her blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg and her pulse was 110heats/minute. Hemoglobin concentration had dropped from 10g/dl to 6g/dl. There were no bruits or palpable masse. The patient regained hemodynamic stability after a 4 U blood transfusion. An ultrasound showed a blood flow containing round structure compatible with a pseudoaneurysm next to the biopsy site at the lower pole of the biopsied kidney. Renal angio-scan revealed a 1,4 cm-sized renal pseudoaneurysm. Renal angiography confirmed the presence of a pseudoaneurysm with extravasation of Co 2 from the lower left interlobar artery. Successful selective embolization of the pseudoaneurysm was performed using gelatine sponge particles. There was no further haematuria. Nevertheless, left lumbago was appeared after embolization, and it is effectively treated with analgesic. Three days after the procedure, follow up Doppler ultrasonography showed no blood flow into the aneurysmal sac."
