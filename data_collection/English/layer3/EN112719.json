  "text": "We present the first case of histopathologically proven CMF originating in the temporal bone and involving the hypoglossal canal in a 40-year-old woman. Hypoglossal nerve paralysis was identified on the cranial nerve examination. The patient underwent surgical excision and was neurologically normal except for mild left facial palsy on 5-mo follow-up examination after surgery. In the current report, the major characteristics and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging features of the lesion are discussed. Furthermore, previous literature regarding this pathology is reviewed."
