  "text": "We present the case of a 65-year-old Caucasian woman who suffered biliary damage following (90)Y administration for metastatic pNETs and subsequently developed cirrhosis. Given the timeline of her various treatments and the lack of any other identifiable etiology for her cirrhosis, we believe this to be a potential long-term complication of (90)Y therapy."
