  "text": "This report describes a case of a 38-year-old white woman, a swimmer, who presented with a sudden episode of swelling and pain in her right upper extremity. After duplex ultrasound diagnosis of venous thrombosis, computed tomography (CT) showed extrinsic compression of the vessel. Catheter-directed thrombolysis was performed in the first 24 hours, followed by anticoagulant therapy with bemiparin at a dose of 7500 IU/24 hours for the first week, and then reduced to 3500 IU/24 hours for the next 3 months. After treatment there was restoration of her venous flow and she returned to work 2 weeks later. Anticoagulant treatment was continued for 3 months; decompression surgery was not performed. At 6 months she was asymptomatic."
