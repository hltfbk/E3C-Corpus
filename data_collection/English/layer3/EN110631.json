  "text": "Because the patient refused to undergo screening tests using any of the amide-type local anesthetics because of her extreme fear against local anesthetics that she had been administered previously, procaine hydrochloride, which is an ester-form local anesthetic, was the only agent to be tested on this patient at the department of dermatology. Consequent to a negative allergy test, we performed complete dental treatment using procaine hydrochloride after additional chairside drug challenge tests using minimum test dose under vital sign monitoring."
