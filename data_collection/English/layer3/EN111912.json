  "text": "We report a rare case of a solitary neurofibroma of the floor of the mouth in a 31-year-old male. The patient consulted the dental emergency department for acute pain of the left mandible. Systematic clinical examination revealed the presence of a mass in the left mouth floor. The panoramic x-ray was not conclusive and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a well-defined soft tissue lesion with homogenous isosignal intensity on the T1-weighted image, high intensity signal on the T2-weighted image and heterogeneous enhancement following contrast-enhancement on the T1-weighted Fast Sat image. The surgical excision of the soft-tissue neoplasm was accomplished by an intraoral approach. The specimen was sent for histopathologic analysis and Immunohistochemical studies which confirmed the diagnosis of a myxoid predominant intraneural solitary neurofibroma."
