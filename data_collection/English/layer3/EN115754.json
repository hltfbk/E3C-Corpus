  "text": "We report a 40-year-old Sri Lankan male who developed neutropenia and low white blood cell counts following commencement of clozapine. We were successful in restarting clozapine after the addition of lithium carbonate to increase the cell counts. Clozapine was increased to 700 mg a day with 500 mg of lithium carbonate. The patient remains stable after one year with no further episodes of neutropenia."
