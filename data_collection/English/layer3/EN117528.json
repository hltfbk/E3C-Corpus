  "text": "A 55-year-old Japanese man who had previously undergone surgery for adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon presented with a metastatic liver tumor accompanied by a macroscopic tumor thrombus in the right portal branch. Right lobectomy and removal of the tumor thrombus were performed, and the liver metastasis and tumor thrombus were successfully resected. Histopathological examination of the liver tumor revealed adenocarcinoma, consistent with that of the previous colon cancer, confirming that the liver tumor was a metastasis from the colon cancer. Our patient remains well without recurrence at 51 months after the liver surgery."
