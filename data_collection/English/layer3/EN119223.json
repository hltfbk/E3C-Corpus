  "text": "Perfluorodecaline was used as a temporary retinal tamponade. Three weeks after the surgery, a residue of heavy liquid was observed in the anterior chamber, even though the patient had an intact crystalline lens without any tilt or dislocation. The remnant of the heavy liquid was taken out of the anterior chamber immediately to avoid secondary complications."
