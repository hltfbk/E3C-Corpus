  "text": "A 32-year-old woman presented with a door handle stuck into her hand. After a preliminary assessment she was immediately taken to theatre. Broad spectrum antibiotics were administered along with tetanus toxoid. Soft tissue, including neurovascular integrity, was assessed and confirmed during the operation. She had a good functional recovery at follow-up."
