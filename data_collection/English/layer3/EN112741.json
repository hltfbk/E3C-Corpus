  "text": "We present the case of an African baby girl, who died when she was 7-months old, who presented with features of collodion membrane at birth. She later developed hypernatremic dehydration and a constricted band on her lower limb that required urgent surgical release. She stayed in our hospital for 35 days; she was then discharged home after improvement for 6 months of follow-up clinics at Muhimbili National Hospital: neonatal; dermatology; ear, nose, and throat; and physiotherapy units. She died at 7 months of age."
