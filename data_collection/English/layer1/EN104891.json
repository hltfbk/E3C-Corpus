  "text": "A 36-year-old female showed mild swelling in the right upper eyelid. She lost her RGP contact lens seven months prior to her first visit, from trauma by her child's kick to the right eye. At the first examination, we felt a firm lump inferior to the right brow. Eversion of the upper eyelid also revealed a firm subconjunctival mass superior to the upper tarsus. After incising the conjunctiva, the RGP contact lens was found without a fibrous capsule and granulation tissue in the subconjunctival space. Three years after removal of the lens, the patient did not show any complications, including ptosis."
