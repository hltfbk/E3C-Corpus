  "text": "A 64-year-old woman was admitted to our institution with palpable lump in her left breast. Patient had not any previous medical and family story of cancer and denied any use of alcohol and cigarettes. She took oral contraception for 5 years. Her menarche was at age 12. Physical examination revealed a 3 cm tumor located on the left breast adhere to deep plans. There was no retraction of the nipple, skin ulceration or inflammatory changes. The right breast exam was negative and there was no clinical evidence of axillary lymph node involvement. Mammography revealed a 2.6 cm round hyperdense mass with irregular and speculated margins in the subareolar area with associated microcalcifications within the mass. The mass was categorized as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 5. Fine needle aspiration and a core biopsy of the lesion were performed and the diagnostic was tubular carcinoma of the breast. The patient underwent left lumpectomy with axillary node dissection. The macroscopic (gross) examination of specimens revealed the presence of a nodule measuring 1.5 cm in its largest diameter. The histology showed that tumor cells were arranged in a rare trabecular pattern with a prominent lymphoid stroma. Carcinomatous cells were polygonal with granular amphophilic cytoplasm and a nucleus with fine chromatin. Nucleoli were generally inconspicuous. Up to 8 mitoses per 10 HPF were counted. No lympho-vascular component or intraductal component was noted. The tumor was grade II of Scarf Bloom Richardson. Surgical margin was clear. The resected axillary lymph nodes contained metastases, including one/19 N level I lymph nodes. The immunohistochemistry study showed an expression of the following antibodies Ck (AE1/AE3) on the carcinomatous component, CD3 and CD20 with homogenous distribution in the stroma. The Ki-67 labeling index was: 40% (estimated on 10HPF), Estrogen receptor status were 90%, progesterone receptor 10% (both using Allred score) and the human epidermal growth factor was negative. Based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings the case has been reported as lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the breast and staged as pT1N1M0.\nThe post-operative pet scan showed no distant metastasis. The laboratory data showed a normal level of carbohydrate antigen 15-3(CA15-3: 39.8 U/ml). Following surgery, the patient underwent four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and twelve cycles of paclitaxel chemotherapy. She declined endocrine therapy and was treated with radiotherapy commencing 3 weeks after chemotherapy. The radiation dose was 50Gy in 25 fractions using a 6MV photon tangent pair followed by a boost of 10Gy in 5 fractions using 6MV photon tangent pair. Regular follow up consists of physical examination every three months. At her 1 year follow-up, the patient was doing well with no evidence of recurrent disease."
