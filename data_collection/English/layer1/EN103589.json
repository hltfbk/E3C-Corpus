  "text": "This is a case report of a 59-year old woman with a 5-year clinical history of perimenopausal uterine bleeding and three explorative curettages. Gynaecological and ultrasound examinations revealed ovarian enlargement with a diameter of 50 mm with hypoechoic zones suspected of benign teratoma. The diagnostic test such as Ca-125, AFP, free-T4 and TSH was in normal range. A smooth, solid right ovarian 50 an mm-size tumour, as well as small amount of fluid in the Douglas pouch, was found during the total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and staging biopsy. The histopathology revealed teratoma with strumal carcinoid tumour IA stage according to AJCC 2010 of the right ovary and negative cytopathology of the fluid from the Douglas pouch. On the postoperative 2-year control, the patient was tumour free, and Ca-125, free-T4 and TSH were in normal range."
