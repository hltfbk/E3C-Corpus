  "text": "A 29-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with an unidentified fever. He was diagnosed with malignant lymphoma (extra-nodal NK/T cell lymphoma nasal type), and chemotherapy was administered. After chemotherapy, nodular lung shadows along with new brain, cervical, and myocardial abscesses appeared, despite anti-bacterial/fungal therapy. Gene analysis of the cervical abscess biopsy revealed the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus species, and the transesophageal echocardiogram showed a mobile mural vegetation in the left ventricle (22 × 8 mm). He underwent surgical resection of this mural vegetation. His postoperative course was uneventful. He remains healthy at 28 months after surgery with continued oral antifungal therapy."
