  "text": "A 23-year-old previously healthy man, presented to the hospital's emergency department, with a 3-day history of high-grade fever up to 40°C and upper right abdominal pain. The patient's past medical history was non-significant. He was a student and had not received any medication. He had a pet dog and reported no recent travel. During physical examination on admission, vital signs were normal and he was febrile with a body temperature of 38°C. Abdominal examination revealed a tender palpable liver, with no signs of peritoneal irritation. The remainder of physical examination was unremarkable. Abnormal laboratory results on admission included a white blood cell count (WBC) of 20.830 (4-10.5x10³/μL), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (28mg/dl, normal ≤0.5mg/dl), slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 56 IU/L (normal 5-40 IU/L), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) of 255 IU/L (normal <225 IU/L). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was normal. Abdominal ultrasonography on admission revealed a mildly enlarged liver and spleen and the presence of 2 sizable, hypoechoic lesions. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the 2 aforementioned lesions in diameter of 5.6cm at the left liver lobe and 5.2cm in the right lobe Figure 1, Figure 2. The lesions were hypodense and presented peripheral enhancement after intravenous contrast, similar to the morphology of hepatic abscesses. The patient was admitted for further evaluation and treatment. Culture guided antimicrobials and appropriate drainage was our first option. Empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous ciprofloxacin (400mg every 12 hours), and metronidazole (500mg every 8 hours) was initiated. All cultures resulted negative. Initially, we performed percutaneous sonographic (U/S) guided aspiration into the left hepatic abscess cavity. A thick, purulent material of 40cc was drained and sent for culture. Microbiology revealed a Gram-negative bacterium that presented slow growth. On the 5 th and 8 th days of admission, we performed CT guided catheter drainage of both abscesses. Meanwhile irregular spikes of fever with daytime variation accompanied by night sweats persisted. Ciprofloxacin discontinued and meropenem at a dose of 1gr every 8 hours administered. Thorough screening for other possible sources of infection, resulted negative. Transthoracic echocardiography was negative for vegetations and showed mild mitral regurgitation. Entamoeba histolytica Abs, echinococcus Abs, leismania Abs, brucella Abs were negative. Gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluation was unrevealing. The patient was also HIV negative and no other immunodeficiency conditions were identified. Eventually, the isolate identified by the Vitek 2 automated system and classified as A. aphrophilus. To confirm the identification of the strain we performed matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The sensitivity test was performed with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) test strips; the isolate's susceptibility was to ceftriaxone ≤0.125 (S), cefepime ≤0.5 (S), ciprofloxacin ≤0.125 (S), gentamycin ≤0.5 (S), amikacin ≤0.125 (S) and to meropenem ≤0.032 (S). Percutaneous drainage of both abscesses, combined with antimicrobial treatment, was successful and the patient's clinical condition improved. Thankfully, no surgical procedure was required. The drains were removed immediately the fluid from the abscess cavities became clear. Meropenem was administered for a total of 2 weeks. Then meropenem was switched to oral ciprofloxacin for another 4 weeks and the patient was discharged from the hospital, in full recovery. Follow-up sonogram obtained almost 2 months after the drainage showed completely normal liver parenchyma without any residual liver cavities."
