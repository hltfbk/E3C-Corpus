  "text": "A 61-year-old woman, gravida 3 para 3, presented with an increased size of ovarian cyst. Her history revealed a diagnosis of left ovarian cyst 3cm in diameter 3 years previously. Her serum cancer antigen (CA) 125 and CA 19-9 levels were within the normal ranges, and she was followed up at 6-month intervals at a private hospital. The ovarian cyst size had not changed in size and structure on biannual transvaginal ultrasound (TVS). However, she was referred to our institution in July 2016 with progression of ovarian cyst to 6cm on a pelvic ultrasonogram 2 weeks ago. The patient underwent menopause at age 48 years, with an uneventful past menstrual cycle. She had no medical history except the benign thyroid nodule, no relevant surgical history and had not received hormonal therapy. Routine blood chemistry and serum tumor marker analysis showed that the levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, CA 125, and human epididymis protein 4 were all within the normal ranges. Uterine cervical cytology at the time of admission was normal. TVS showed a left ovarian unilocular cyst, size 6cm × 5cm × 4cm, with diffuse low-level internal echoes, thin walled, smooth margined, no septa and no papillary projections. The uterus size was 6cm × 4cm × 3cm, and a 1cm uterine myoma was found in the fundus. Pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (ECT) images revealed a unilocular cystic lesion measuring 6 cm at its widest dimension, without enhancing solid intramural nodules and no evidence of lymphadenopathy or ascites. CT scan indicated benign ovarian cystic tumors.\nThe patient underwent laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery. On laparoscopic inspection, the cyst was found to be located in the ampullary and fimbrial regions of the left fallopian tube. The left fallopian tube was grossly unremarkable and the left ovary was atrophied. The left ovary and tube were completely separate from the cyst and the cyst was surrounded by a translucent wall with serous cystic components, but solid components were not seen inside. Clinical diagnosis was suggestive of left paratubal cyst. The patient underwent hysterectomy and BSO. Although tumor markers were normal and there was no presence of papillary projections, the progression in size in the postmenopausal woman indicated a possible malignancy. Frozen sections were prepared from surgery specimens and confirmed a benign cyst. After surgery, the pelvic cavity was explored and no specific findings were found in the abdominal cavity.\nHistopathological examination of the paratubal cyst revealed the presence of polypoid lesions on the internal surface of the cyst. The tumor cells showed nuclear atypism and stratification, which are histological characteristics of borderline tumor. A final diagnosis of paratubal borderline serous tumor was confirmed. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3. CT images were retrospectively evaluated, focusing on the left ovary, fallopian tube, and paratubal cyst after surgery. Multiplanar reconstruction CT imaging revealed linear fat planes between the left ovary and the cyst, indicating that the left ovary, fallopian tube and paratubal cyst were separate structures, similar to those seen during surgery. The tumor was not completely staged, and a comprehensive surgical staging operation was recommended; however, the patient refused adjuvant surgical treatment and opted for close follow-up. Pelvic ECT, TVS and tumor markers were checked every three months. The patient remains asymptomatic and follow-up at 24 months showed no evidence of recurrence or metastasis."
