  "text": "A 60 year-old man presented to an outside institution for septic shock with hematesis. He had a medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and he was amputated right leg (trans-femoral amputation) for diabetic arteriopathy six months before admission complicated by venous thrombosis. Home medications included daily pioglitazone, atenolol, furosemide and anticoagulant with poor compliance. Initial examination revealed a patient in state of septic shock, respiratory rate 28 cycles per min, his pulse was regular with an apical rate of 120 beats/min, temperature 39Â° C, blood pressure 70/40 mmHg, he had necrotic and suppurative amputation stump with peripheral pulse abolished. Patient was given immediately oxygen, fluids, antibiotics, and drugs to increase blood pressure. Six hours later, the patient presented a single episode of hematemesis. There was no associated melena or abdominal pain. He had no history of alcohol use, liver disease, varices, peptic ulcer disease, abdominal aortic surgery, nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drug use, gastroparesis, or previous GI bleeding. Physical examination was unremarkable. Pertinent laboratory studies included a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL, platelet count was normal, blood urea of 1,2 g/l (0,18-0,45 g/L), and a creatinine level of 68 mg/L (7-13 mg/L). After hemodynamic stabilization, an oesophageo-gastro-duodenoscopy was performed which showed: The upper third of the esophagus was circumferentially congestive, but the middle and lower third showed circumferential black pigmentation: the mucosa was black and covered by an exudate of the same color associated with diffuse bleeding. Gastric mucosa was strictly normal in direct vision and in retrovision, the bulb and duodenum were normal. Biopsie specimens were showed necrotic debris, mucosal submucosal necrosis with a local inflammatory response. The treatment of this condition was based continuous high dose omeprazole (8 mg / h) after bolus of 80mg and total parenteral nutrition. The patient experienced no further hematemesis or melena. Due to the severity of the necrosis, and with deterioration of his condition and persistent sepsis he died later in the same day."
