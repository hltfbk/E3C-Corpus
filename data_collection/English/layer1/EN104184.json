  "text": "We report a 9-year-old male child who was referred to us with swelling in the posterior aspect of the neck. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the cervical spine show an elongated left spinous process in the neck at the level of C5 vertebrae. There was an associated hemivertebra at the C4 level. Computed tomography examination better depicted this congenital variant and clearly showed the associated schisis of the posterior arch as well as unfused spinous process at the same level on the left side. This is a very rare congenital anomaly and probably among the few such cases reported in literature."
