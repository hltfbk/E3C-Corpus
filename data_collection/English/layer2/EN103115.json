  "text": "A 37-year-old man was admitted with a headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, and numbness of the left cheek and upper limb for 10 days. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows the lesion in his right frontal lobe. Blood gas analysis indicated lower blood oxygen saturation level, and blood routine test showed hemoglobin elevation. Craniotomy for the lesion and decompressive craniotomy were performed. Brain abscess was confirmed by pathology examination. The chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a pulmonary arteriovenous fistula (PAVF) in his right lower lung. After 1 month, embolization of PAVF was performed. Anoxic symptom improved after surgery. Cranioplasty was performed after 7 months."
