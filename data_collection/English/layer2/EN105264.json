  "text": "A previously healthy 4-year-old boy presented with a 2-day history of vomiting, diarrhoea, and fever, complicated by reduced level of consciousness. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a marked hyperintensity in the splenium of the corpus callosum on T2 and diffusion-weighted images. Rotavirus genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction in a stool specimen, but not in the cerebrospinal fluid. The genotype was identified as G1P8. His clinical condition improved with gradual resolution of his symptoms. No neurological complications were evident upon discharge and the patient had no recurring symptoms or significant residual defects when followed up 2 months later."
