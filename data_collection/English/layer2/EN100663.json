  "text": "A 28-year-old woman, at 32 weeks of pregnancy, without significant medical history, presented to the emergency room with severe abdominal pain in the right flank, evolving during 48 hours. Abdominal palpation revealed tenderness in the right iliac fossa with guarding. Blood test demonstrated an inflammatory syndrome (175 mg/l of C-reactive protein) and neutrophilic hyperleukocytosis. Two abdominal ultrasounds were performed but were not contributive. Due to lack of clinical improvement and increasing inflammatory parameters, an abdominal CT scan as performed and showed free fluid and inflammation medial to the caecum, next to the gravid uterus. This image was compatible with acute appendicitis. Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. Conversion to laparotomy was required due to the hemodynamic status of the patient. An inflamed appendix was found just medial to the caecum with necrosis of the tip and a macroscopically healthy base. Free fluid was present in the right iliac fossa. The postoperative period was marked by ileus treated by a nasogastric tube. The patient went into early labor 3 days after surgery and delivered a healthy baby. Macroscopic examination of the appendectomy specimen revealed a 7 cm long appendage with a maximum diameter of 3 cm. The appendiceal wall was significantly thickened. Microscopic examination showed a proliferation of large polygonal decidual cells within the mesoappendix, characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and nuclei without any cytonuclear atypia. Mitotic activity was not observed. The extensive appendiceal deciduosis showed strong immunoreactivity for vimentin, without expression of PLAP, broad-spectrum cytokeratins (CK-AE1/AE3), inhibin, CD68, S100 or calretinin. The differential diagnosis of appendiceal deciduosis includes decidualized endometriosis. In the current case, no endometrial glands were identified. Acute inflammation of the appendiceal mucosa was histologically confirmed, suggesting that appendiceal deciduosis might have caused an appendiceal obstruction and subsequent inflammation."
