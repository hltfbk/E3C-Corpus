  "text": "A 21-year-old male patient with a long history of recurrent epistaxis, with onset of progressive right unilateral nasal obstruction, motivated him to consult the Ear, Nose and Throat Department, where he initially benefited from a nasofibroscopy that showed a right pterygo-maxillary fossa process. On physical examination, there was no cervical adenopathy palpable. A cervico-facial CT scan and brain level was performed and showed a hypervascular tumor process centered on the right pterygo-maxillary fossa. The diagnosis of an angiofibroma was confirmed by biopsy with anatomopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. He was operated on with total removal of the tumor. The clinical course was marked by an improvement in the patient's clinical symptomatology with disappearance of epistaxis and nasal obstruction. CT scan of the control facial mass after surgery showed no sign of tumour recurrence. After a free interval of nine months after surgery, the patient presented a reappearance of the epistaxis and obstruction, which this time associated with a notion of right temporal headaches. In addition, it was refractory to usual analgesics, and was associated with decreased visual acuity in the right eye. The patient consulted again in the Ear, Nose and Throat department. The physical examination found visual acuity at 6/10 of the right eye and 10/10 of the left eye. The fundus of both eyes was normal. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. A nasofibroscopy done in the patient who showed a recurrence of his tumor process. The exploration was completed by MRI of the facial mass which revealed the presence of an ethmoidonasal tumour process measuring 70x50x40 mm, heterogeneous with a double cystic and fleshy component, extending into the right maxillary sinus and the homolateral para-pharyngeal space, with extra-axial intracranial extension in the right temporal region. The tumor has been classified V according to the classification of Snyderman et al. (Table 1). The patient's file was discussed in a multidisciplinary consultation meeting and the tumor was judged by the surgeons to be in extirpated. External radiotherapy (RT) was then decided. He was planned for a total dose of 45 Gy of RT in 25 fractions, at a daily dose fraction of 1,8 Gy over 5 weeks using the intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique with fields prescribed to the 100% isodose line, using 6-MV photons. We were able to keep the tolerance doses of organs at risk such as the optic chiasma, optic nerves, retina, pituitary and parotids within normal limits and at the same time deliver the intended dose of radiation to the tumor site. The ophthalmological examination performed at the end of the treatment resulted in an improvement in the visual acuity of the right side measured at 9/10. The patient reported an improvement in clinical symptomatology, with disappearance of epistaxis, nasal obstruction and headache. A CT scan of the facial mass and cerebral area performed at two months after the end of irradiation which showed a clear reduction in tumor mass."
