  "text": "A 54-year-old man was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of a liver lesion. The patient was asymptomatic and had a history of emergent splenectomy after a high-altitude falling accident. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a 4.5 × 3.3 cm lesion that was located in segment IV of the left liver lobe. The lesion had an inhomogeneous enhancement during the arterial phase and diminished enhancement during the portal and equilibrium phases. Similar radiological features were also observed on a contrast magnetic resonance imaging scan. Partial hepatectomy was performed with the suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma. Pathological examination of the liver specimen revealed intrahepatic splenosis."
