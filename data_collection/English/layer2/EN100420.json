  "text": "Female patient, 45 years old, referred for left mastectomy with sentinel lymph node resection. There was no other comorbidities; she denied smoking and allergies to medicines, foods and latex. Preoperative tests, such as cardiac examination, blood count, coagulation, biochemistry (urea, glucose, creatinine, AST, ALT) and urinalysis were normal. The patient was not premedicated. At the operating room, intra venous infusion was performed at the right upper limb with 20G Teflon catheter. Basic monitoring with cardioscope, pulse oximeter, and non invasive blood pressure showed normal sinus rhythm, heart rate (HR) of 78 bpm, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% and blood pressure of 120 × 70 mmHg. After preoxygenation with 100% O2 via face mask and administration of cefazolin \\(2 g), induction of anesthesia was achieved with fentanyl (250 g), propofol (150 mg) and rocuronium (50 mg). Tracheal intubation was performed with a 7.5 mm cuffed tube and basic monitoring complemented with capnography; controlled mechanical ventilation with 570 mL tidal volume and 12 ipm respiratory rate. At that point, cardiorespiratory parameters evidenced normal sinus rhythm, HR 84 bpm, SpO2 100%, ETCO2 30, and PA 110 × 75 mmHg. Maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with sevoflurane (2---2.5%) and O2/N2O (50/50%). Immediately before the incision, a subdermal per areolarinjection of 2.5% patent blue (2 mL) was performed. About 25 min after the blue dye injection, increased HR (110 bpm) and allergic skin reaction occurred without changes in blood pressure, SpO2, and capnography. Ringer's lactate (400 mL) was administered and end-tidal sevoflurane concentration decreased to 1.5%. About 10 min after volume replacement and a decrease in the fraction of inspired halogenated, blood pressure was 100 × 60 mmHg and HR 85 bpm, without changes in the remaining parameters. The anesthetic-surgical procedure went through without complications. Dipyrone (2 g) was used for postoperative analgesia. The duration of surgery was 50 min. At the end of the procedure, atropine (1 mg) and neostigmine (2 mg) were used for neuromuscular blockade reversal. After surgical field removal, the presence of numerous urticaria-like plates (bluish) was observed mainly in the face, neck, upper limbs, and thorax.\nHydrocortisone (500 mg) was administered. The patient quickly awakened from anesthesia and was extubated in the operating room. She was conscious, free of pain and with cardiovascular and respiratory stability (blood pressure: 120 × 80 mmHg, HR: 78 bpm, and SpO2: 98%). The patient was taken to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). After 60 min, the patient had no skin changes and was discharged from PACU 180 min after surgery. The patient was discharged from hospital the morning after surgery without complications.\nPatient gave her informed written consent for publication."
