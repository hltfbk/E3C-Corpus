  "text": "42-year-old woman, single, with no significant personal or family history. She consulted for pelvic pain with pelvic mass that lasting for a month prior toconsultation. The clinical assessment of the patient revealed an abdomino-pelvic mass of hard consistency, measuring three inches, not mobilized from the uterus. On ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis, the mass appeared tissue and vascular on color Doppler, measuring 112/85 mm. Abdomino-pelvic CT scan showed a pelvi-abdominal tissue necrosis in places, slightly enhanced by injection of contrast, measuring 100/70/60 mm. They were multiple peritoneal nodules with an overdensity of mesenteric fat, pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic and aorto-caval arteries. The liver and spleen were homogeneous with focal lesion. The CA 125 was increased to 708 IU / mL. An exploratory laparotomy showed a solid vegetating tumor of the right tube, measuring 100/80 mm. Both ovaries and the contralateral horn were free of any gross lesions. The tumor invaded the bladder and a vermiform appendix. 150 mL of ascites fluid was aspirated. A tumor biopsy of 80/70/20 mm was collected and sent to frozen section for histology. The result of the biopsy showed a poorly differentiated and invasive malignant tumor proliferation. A total hysterectomy with adnexal conservation without appendectomy, with omentectomy and partial resection of the bladder was performed. Parietal and peritoneal biopsies were done. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged on day 15 post-op. The pathological diagnosis showed a solid tumor proliferation, whitish, infiltrating, with mesotubular extension, adhering to the front right side of the uterus and measuring 12 centimeters in diameter. The microscopic aspect was consistent with adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated, infiltrating, necrotic, with mesotubular and meso appendix extension. A chest radiograph was normal. No recurrence was noted at 6 months post-op."
