There was a history of recurrent episodes of cough and breathlessness since age of 4 months, with an increase in the frequency and severity of the episodes in the few past weeks. He was receiving treatment from his practitioner, but was referred for increasing breathlessness. Early development was normal, except language and dentition delayed. There was no family history.\nOn examination, the child was febrile and had respiratory distress with intercostal and subcostal retractions. The respiratory rate was 60/min, heart rate 110/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mmhg, SaO 2 was 60% in the ambient air and then increased up to 94% using 2l of oxygen. The weight and height were 10 kg (under 2DS) and 70 cm (normal for that age) respectively. The face had a senile appearance with pendulous ear lobes and lax skin. His thorax is deformed with scoliosis. There was a right-sided, reducible, inguinal hernia. There was no laxity of joints. Chest examination revealed the bilaterally creptations. Cardiovascular examination was normal with first and second heart sounds were heard normally. Examination of the abdomen was normal with no palpable liver and spleen. Others systems were normal.\nTest showed hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dl, a total WBC count of 17270/mm 3 with a differential count of polymorphs of 42%, lymphocytes of 56%. Routine biochemical investigations yielded normal results. CRP was 26 mg/l TORSH (toxoplasmosis, rubella, syphilis, herpes) serologies were negatives. A chest x-ray showed emphysema in the left lung, opacities in the right lung and cadiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of 0.6. Electrocardiography showed aortic dilatation, mitral valve prolapsed and sign of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Thoracic computed tomography revealed alveolar condensations and localizations of emphysema. Gastric fibroscopy was normal\nThe child was treated with bronchodilators and antibiotics."
