  "text": "A 49-year-old woman presented with neck pain lasting for several months and second and third finger radiating pain. Severe cervical herniated intervertebral disc findings could be identified at C6-7 level on C-spine MRI. ACDF C6-7 surgery was performed. Immediately after the operation, physical examination revealed paraplegia and emergency MRI was performed. On MR images, T2 high signal myelopathy suspected as reperfusion injury at C6-7 level, and emergency surgery was performed under diagnosis of white cord syndrome. After the emergency operation, the paraplegic problem was gradually resolved. Before discharge, motor power and sensory deficit of bilateral lower extremity were fully recovered."
