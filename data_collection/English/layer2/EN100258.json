  "text": "Patient 1 A two-month-old boy had been hospitalized in pediatric surgery unit for suspected tracheo-osefageal fistula. He was referred from another hospital with the diagnosis of recurrent aspiration pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotic therapy.On the admission, he had tachypnea and subfebrile fever on physical examination.Laboratory tests showed a white blood cell (WBC) of 10900/µl, C-reactive protein (CRP) of 11.8 mg/L and normal biochemistry values. Peripheral blood culture wasobtained.Twelve hours later, the BacT/Alert device (bioMerièux, Marseille, France) gave a signal indicating a growth of microorganism. Gram staining was positive forgram-negative coccobacilli. The microorganism was nonmotile, strictly aerobic, catalase-positive and oxidase-negative. Empirical antibiotic treatment with meropenem and amikacin was started. The next day, Vitek MS (bioMerièux, Marseille, France) identified the microorganism as Acinetobacterursingii and reliability was 99.9%. The E-test used to describe antimicrobiological susceptibility showed that the microorganism was susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, gentamicin,ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The antibiotic therapy was de-escalated to ampicillin-sulbactam. On the third day of the treatment, control peripheral blood culture was taken and remainedsterile.He was successfully treated with ampicillin-sulbactam. Patient 2 A fourteen-month-old boy with the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease was admitted to our hospital with complaints of vomiting and diarrhea for amonth.On admission, his physical examination revealed fever (38.4 ° C). Because of the prolonged diarrhea and vomiting, patient was hospitalized and further investigated. Laboratory tests showed a WBC of 5800/µl, CRP of 3.2 mg/L and normal biochemistry values.Peripheral blood culture was obtainedand signaled growth for gram-negative bacilli. Empirical antibiotic treatment with meropenem and amikacin was started. Microorganism was identified as Acinetobacterursingii by Vitek MS (bioMerièux) with a reliability of 99.9%. The e-test showed that A. ursingii was susceptible to ampicilin-sulbactam, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The antibiotic therapy was deescalated to ampicin-sulbactam. On the third day of the treatment, control peripheral blood culture remained sterile. He was successfully treated with ampicillin-sulbactam."
