  "text": "A 29-year-old primigravida Japanese woman presented to our hospital at 40 weeks and 1 day of gestation with marked vaginal bleeding. Since admission, fetal heart rate tracing consistently demonstrated a sawtooth-like pattern. There were 3-4 oscillations per minute, and their amplitude was 30-40 beats per minute. An emergency cesarean section was performed because of non-reassuring fetal status. Evidence of placental abruption was not observed. The newborn was a male weighing 2936 g, with an Apgar score of 1 and 3 at 1 minute and 5 minutes, respectively. The infant received brain cooling, but was discharged uneventfully. A follow-up examination at age 3 years demonstrated no developmental restriction."
