  "text": "The case of an 84-year-old woman who sustained a periprosthetic tibial fracture 10 years after a TKA is presented. This patient had multiple risk factors. The fracture was not deemed amenable to conventional treatment because the bone fragment was too small. This patient underwent fixation of her tibial fracture above the TKA using a five-ring Ilizarov external fixator. This allowed immediate full weight-bearing. The fixator was removed at 12 weeks, at which time the fracture was solidly healed. At the most recent follow-up, 2 years from injury, she was fully weight-bearing without walking aids and had a knee range of motion (ROM) of 0-110°."
