  "text": "We report two patients with dysphagia due to LMS and propose a novel technique named hyoid-complex elevation and stimulation technique (known as HEST). The two patients had no other functional incapacity back into life, but nasogastric feeding was the only possible way for nutrition because of severe aspirations. Swallowing function was evaluated by functional oral intake scale, modified water swallow test, surface electromyographic signal associated with video fluorography swallowing study to assess the situation of aspiration, pharyngeal residue, pharyngeal peristalsis, upper esophageal opening and the ability of deglutition. Both patients were treated with the HEST method for dysphagia and recovered quickly."
