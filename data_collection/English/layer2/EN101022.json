  "text": "A 45-year-old male presented with a left SSS and a bilateral concha bullosa. He developed a contralateral SSS two years after an endoscopic uncinectomy and re-ventilation of the diseased maxillary sinus. This case is the second reported in literature with a metachronous presentation. A pure endoscopic approach has led to the resolution of symptomatology and the full restoration of the ventilation of the maxillary sinuses. The key role of the uncinate process in the genesis of the pathology has been well demonstrated by the onset of a contralateral SSS in a normally developed maxillary sinus thanks to a complete radiological follow-up."
