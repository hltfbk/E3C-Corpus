  "text": "A 30 year old female was referred to the University Teaching Hospital from a primary health centre for persistent itchy generalised body rash of 2 months. On admission, a diagnosis of acute gastritis with persistent skin infection was made. On subsequent review, the patient gave a history of the rash having started from upper limbs and then spread to the trunk and lower limbs. The rash begun as erythematous grouped vesicles preceded by an intense pruritus. The patient was also experiencing abdominal pains of two weeks' duration which were more severe during and after meals with associated nausea and vomiting. She denied taking any medications prior to development of the rash and had no previous history of any allergies. The review of other systems was unremarkable. She received intravenous and topical hydrocortisone at the referring clinic with no improvement noted. On examination, she was stable, not febrile and had no lesions in the oral cavity. The systemic examination was unremarkable. On local examination, she had generalised, symmetrical skin lesions in different stages of development (vesicles, erosions, crusts and post inflammatory hypo-and hyper-pigmented macules). The lesions were mostly affecting the trunk, buttocks, extensor surface of lower limbs and upper limbs, sparing the head, neck and palms. Vesicular lesions were grouped on an erythematous base. A diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis with suspected celiac disease was made. Endoscopy was done and a skin punch biopsy of a vesicle was taken and sent for histopathology which was suggestive of DH or Bullous Pemphigoid. The patient was started on Dapsone and a gluten-free diet. She improved markedly and was discharged with a planned follow up. The results of the investigations ordered are displayed in the table below (Table 1)."
