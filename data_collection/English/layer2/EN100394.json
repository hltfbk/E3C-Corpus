  "text": "A 49-year-old woman with no past medical history or cardiovascular risk factors presents to the emergency department with severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Review of system revealed left hip pain for which patient took aspirin 1 g couple of hours prior to her current presentation. Further history reveals that she experiences similar symptoms of chest pain and shorness of breath after taking aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). On arrival, the heart rate was 100 bpm, blood pressure: 120/70 mmHg. Physical exam reveals bilateral expiratory lung wheezing. Chest X ray was unremarkable, ECG showed ST segment elevation in the inferior leads. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a kinetic abnormalities of anterolateral and inferior walls with a left ventricule ejection fraction of 35%.\nThe initial troponin I us was makeredly increased with concentration of 50 ng/ml (147 times the normal laboratory value). Coronary angiogram revealed a severe stenosis in the ostium of Right coronary artery (RCA) and a discrete stenosis in the distal left anterior descending artery (LAD). A percutaneous angioplasty was performed on RCA lesion. Repeated echocardiogram showed an improvement of the left ventricule ejection fraction to 50%. Patient was discharged on standard medical therapy including aspirin and clopidogrel.\nIn the subsequent month, patient had multiple recurrences of chest pain asthma attacks and was admitted with a NSTEMI a month later. Repeat coronary angiography showed a patent LAD stent and severe diffuse stenosis affecting all coronary arteries. This time patient was treated with intracoronary nitroglycerin with relieve of symptoms. The new occurrence of asthma attacks associated with asprin consumption was finalty related to Samter's syndrome.\nSinus tomography and a nasal endoscopy revealed the presence of bilateral nasal polyposis confirming the diagnosis of the aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) diagnosed as the coexistence of asthma, nasal polyps and aspirin allergy. Aspirin was discontinued and patient discharged on Clopidogrel. Patient remained free of asthma attack and chest pain during two year follow-up."
