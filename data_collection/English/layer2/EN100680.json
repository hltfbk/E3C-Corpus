  "text": "A 38-years-old male, with known history of hypertension, obesity and gallstones, presented in the emergency room with abdominal pain in the upper right quadrant that radiated to the right shoulder. After clinical, laboratory and ultrasound evaluation, the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis was established. He was admitted for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Intraoperatively, an acute gangrenous cholecystitis with a contained perforation was found. Due to the marked inflammation, dissection of the hilum and the gallbladder was laborious and gallstones leaked out of the gallbladder. This was identified and an abundant peritoneal lavage was performed as well as an attempt to remove all leaked gallstones. No more intra or postoperative complications were recorded, and the patient was discharged on the 5 th postoperative day after antibiotic therapy with Piperacillin/Tazobactam, completely asymptomatic. In a follow-up appointment, 1 month after surgery, the patient reported new onset of abdominal pain, at the upper right quadrant, with progressive worsening. Upon observation, he was sweaty, with pain at the superficial and deep palpation of the right hypochondrium. For that reason, he was referred to the emergency room. Due to the recent history of surgery, it was decided to perform laboratory and imaging investigation. The blood work showed leukocytosis without neutrophilia and elevated PCR. The computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed: “in the right hypochondrium, at the transverse and internal oblique muscles, a marked thickening with 69x31x26 mm, with a poorly defined margin and with densification of the surrounding fat, and an image of hyper-attenuation with 9mm”. An ultrasound was made to clarify these findings: “a pericentrimetric calcification is observed in the abdominal wall, about 6 cm deep from the cutaneous surface, with adjacent pseudonodular densification”. These findings were compatible with a migrated stone and small surrounding collection. The patient was discharged with the indication for antibiotics therapy (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) and analgesia. The complaints disappeared and it was decided to keep an expectant attitude. The patient maintained regular follow-up and reported intermittent pain in the referred region but not disabling. For that reason, elective removal of the gallstone was proposed. Before elective surgery, he returned to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain associated with fever and an upper right abdominal tumefaction. Abdominal exam showed a hard, painful mass with inflammatory signs on the right hypochondrium. Laboratory work revealed leukocytosis without neutrophilia and a new ultrasound and CT scan showed thickening of the abdominal wall, that echographically translated a hypoechoic formation of 6x5 cm and may correspond to an abscess and/or phlegm with possible liquefaction. Also, a prominent external anterior parietal thickening measuring 8x6 cm, with two deep calcifications of 10 and 8 mm, one most likely a chondral alteration and the other a possible gallstone”. An abscess of the abdominal wall due to a foreign body (gallstone) was diagnosed. The patient completed one week of antibiotics and underwent surgery, under general anesthesia. At that time, there was no evidence of abscess on the abdominal wall and a foreign body granuloma was found occupying the entire abdominal wall, with a pigmented gallstone in pre-peritoneal position. So, extraction of the gallstone and the respective foreign body granuloma was performed, which was later confirmed through histopathological examination. Post-operative period was without complications, with progressive improvement of symptoms. The patient was followed for a year, remaining asymptomatic throughout this entire period, without other manifestations due to lost gallstones."
