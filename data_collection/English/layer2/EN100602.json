  "text": "A 25-year female patient visited our prosthetic office with deficiencies of both hands due to autoimmune disease. The amputations were performed in 2015. After the examination of both hands, it was revealed that in the right hand; the metacarpal of the index finger, the distal phalanges of the second and fourth fingers were amputated; and in the left hand; the metacarpals of the thumb and of the second fingers and the proximal phalange of the third finger were amputated. It was also noticed that there was a flexum of the proximal phalange of the stump of the third finger. Since the amputations, the patient has never worn any prosthesis. The subject has requested finger prostheses to improve the quality of life. The case was discussed and with the consent for the patient's rehabilitation of fingers, silicone prostheses was planned for the first stage of the treatment. The measurements were taken by a Certified Prosthetist. The manufacturing of the prosthesis consisted of the following steps: the impression taking, the wax pattern and the laboratory works as described in former studies [9, 10]. The case described here presented with multiple amputations of both hands which present the amputation of the distal phalange of the second finger as well. That made it difficult taking the impression on the sound finger. So, the impression was done on the contralateral finger of the patient. The impressions were taking with hydrophilic vinyl-polysiloxane impression material. The finger was in relax position while taking the pattern. Two layers of the impression material were wrapped on the fingers for about 10 minutes and the negative molds were taken off after the setting was done. Then the liquid wax was poured into the impression mold to retrieve the positive replica of the hand. Then another impression was taken from the wax mold to create the final mold in which the silicone solution was inserted. To ensure a total suspension of the prosthesis, a suspension cavity was created in the mold using a pin made with cast following technique described in the former study [10]. In order to match the patient's skin colour, the artist's oil colours were used to mix with the silicone solution. To ensure total aesthetics, the nail part was first packed then the dorsal and palmar aspects were mixed and packed separately in the mold. Due to unavailability of electric oven to heat the silicone solution, the mold was closed and heated using a kitchen gas stove for about an hour. In order to have all the surface of the cast with the average temperature, the surfaces of the cast mold were turned periodically on the stove gas. The finished prosthesis was then retrieved from the mold and excess silicone flesh was trimmed from the margins. The prostheses were tried on the patient after she was educated on how to take care of the prosthesis. Through the technique described above, good suspension and real looking finger prosthesis as patient's skin colour was manufactured. The subject was able to don the prosthesis on her own and had no pain when wearing it and was able to grab an object. The patient was satisfied with the final aspect of the prosthesis."
