  "text": "M.F. 1 year, and M.B. 2 years and half, with no particular antecedents are received in pediatric emergencies for post-circumcision bleeding. No hemostasis assessment being carried out before the act. On admission, the brothers were conscious and had a good condition. There were no familial antecedents.\nAfter stopping bleeding, blood test was requested for both brothers.\nFor M.F: as result of hemostatic balance sheet, we found : PT= 95%, APTT= 80 sec, F VIII < 1%, F IX = 54%.\nHaemogram is as follow: HGB = 8.7 g/dl, MCV = 51 fl, MCH = 16 pg, WBC = 7760 /mm 3 and platelets = 391.000/ mm 3.\nBecause of the microcytosis, ferritin blood test was made which was normal, about 30 ng/ml.\nElectrophoresis of hemoglobin was realized to explore the microcytosis, the result was : Hb A1= 60,9 %, Hb S = 35,9%, Hb A2 = 3.2%.\nFor M.B, The hemostatic balance sheet is as follows: PT = 110 %, APTT = 72 sec, F VIII < 1%, F IX = 60 %.\nHaemogram : HGB = 10.7 g/dl, MCV = 66 fl, MCH = 22 pg, WBC = 6870 /mm 3, platelets = 193.000/ mm 3. Ferritin was 32 ng/ml.\nElectrophoresis of hemoglobin was as follow: Hb A1= 57 %, Hb S = 38.5 %, Hb A2 = 4.5 %.\nNone of the children has received a blood transfusion.\nWe conclude that it is about a post-circumcision bleeding due to major hemophilia A associated to sickle cell AS, this association was a systematic discovery.\nThere was no family history of sickle cell anemia, but electrophoresis of hemoglobin was realized for the mother, result was as follow: Hb A1= 62 %, Hb S = 35,5 %, Hb A2 = 2,2 %."
