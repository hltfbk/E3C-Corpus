  "text": "45 years old female patient who presented with a vulvar ulcer for one year without other symptoms. She was HIV infected with CD4+ of 291 cells/Î¼L on highly active retroviral treatment. She was previously treated for pulmonary tuberculosis for six months. She had no other co-morbidities or family history of malignancy. On examination, she had good performance score. The abdomen was soft with right inguinal lymphadenopathy. Per vaginal examination revealed an ulcerated nodule on the right labia majora extending from the right labia minora into the right lower 2/3 of the vagina. This lesion was close to the anal sphincter, but did not involve the pelvic bone. It was draining foul smelling dark discharge. She did not have pigmented lesion/nevus on any part of the body. A biopsy of the ulcer showed malignant melanoma. The patient was counselled about the disease and the prognosis thereof. She was further investigated for extent of the disease and possible metastasis. The chest X-ray was unremarkable. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed a vulvovaginal tumour which pushed the uterus superiorly. It did not show bladder or rectal involvement. Computed Tomography (CT) showed pelvic lymph nodes metastasis. The full blood count showed hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dl while the rest of the blood investigation was unremarkable. She was offered pelvic exenteration but declined. A hemivulvectomy and vaginectomy with inguinofemoral and pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. An ulcerated, multinodular and rubbery tumour measuring 90x50x25mm was received with pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes for histopathological assessment. Microscopy showed a malignant nodular melanoma evidenced by an ulcerated tumour arranged in a nodular pattern without epithelial component. The tumour cells had pleomorphic and vesicular nuclei with prominent inclusion-like nucleoli. Intracytoplasmic melanin pigment was not seen. The tumour corresponded to Clark level V and Breslow stage V. There was no brisk intratumoural lymphocytic infiltrate. The mitotic count was 15 per square millimeter. The tumour cells were immunoreactive for melanin A, HMB45 and S-100 protein. Molecular studies confirmed a BRAF pV600E mutation. The tumour was present at the vaginal resection margin and 1mm from the closest soft tissue excision margins. Only 3 of the 17 inguinofemoral lymph nodes showed metastatic diseases. Post-surgically, she presented with recto-vaginal fistula after 23 days. A diverting colostomy was performed and discharged to home. She came back after a month to the gynaecology clinic with shortness of breath, weakness and pain of the lower limbs. Per vaginal examination revealed bleeding and non-healing operation side and a well colostomy. Although the biopsy was not done at this stage, a clinical diagnosis of local recurrence was made. A CXR at this point showed upper lobes nodules and left pleural effusion in keeping with lung metastasis. She was referred to radiation oncology where she received palliation radiotherapy of 8 Grays and one fraction of radiation. She was discharged from oncology due to poor treatment response. She was eventually discharged home for palliation care and has since been lost to follow-up clinic."
