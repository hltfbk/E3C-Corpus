  "text": "A 37-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with frequency, urgency and odynuria for 3 months. He received open right inguinal hernia repair in September 2014, and right laparoscopic hernioplasty for recurrence of the inguinal hernia in May 2015. In February 2019, he underwent a day-case transurethral cystoscopic operation for urethral and bladder stones. Cystoscopy revealed the existence of bladder stones and part of the eroded mesh on the right anterior wall, for which an open partial cystectomy was performed. The patient was followed up for 3 months postoperatively, during which no further mesh erosion or stone recurrence was detected by cystoscopy."
