  "text": "We present a case of a 43-year-old female who presented at the accident and emergency department of Princess Marina Hospital, Gaborone, Botswana. She was referred from a peripheral hospital. She reported a deep dull aching pain in the right iliac fossa that has been progressively becoming worse. She had no associated vomiting or change in bowel habits. She reported no weight loss. The pain was of two years duration and has been in and out of hospital on antibiotics and analgesia. She was referred to Princess Marina Hospital after having been found to have a large sausage like cystic mass extending from the pelvis up to the medial aspect of the ascending colon on ultrasound. Its origins were unclear. There was no free fluid seen on ultrasound. The patient was otherwise afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She had normal full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests and pregnancy was negative. She was admitted to the ward on analgesia and an abdomino-pelvic CT scan was performed the next day, which showed a sausage like cystic mass extending from the pelvis up to the hepatic flexure of the colon with the cecum displaced and ante-flexed over the ascending colon. There were no liver lesions or lymphadenopathy noted. The length of the mass was 17.27 cm and the maximum diameter was 5.28cm. There was no free fluid in the abdomen. An impression of appendiceal mucocele was made after the surgeon and the radiologist carefully analysed the CT scan. A semi-elective right hemi-colectomy was planned. Intraoperative findings: a distended massive appendix pushing the redundant cecal end up to the hepatic flexure of the colon and the tip of the appendix into the right iliac fossa was found. Exploration of the abdomen revealed no metastatic processes, no lymphadenopathy and no other malignancies. The pelvic organs were all normal. There was no leak of appendicular contents and the appendix was not adherent to surrounding structures. The distended appendix was isolated carefully and delivered from the abdomen. A right hemicolectomy was performed making sure not to rupture the appendix or cause any leakage of its contents. A stapled functional end-to-end ileo-colic anastomosis was performed. The patient recovery was uneventful and was discharged day 6 post-operation. She was seen at the outpatient clinic 6 weeks later and had uneventful postoperative course. Histology results revealed a low-grade appendicular mucinous neoplasm with negative margins and no involved mesenteric lymph nodes.\nHistopathology report *All slide sections are stained with Haematoxylin & Eosin (H/E) X50: low power viewing) : the appendiceal wall shows a flattened and misplaced epithelium (on top) as well as marked fibrosis surrounding a focus of dystrophic calcification (blue stained material in the centre of the image)\nX100 and x400: medium and high power viewing) : the appendiceal wall shows an intestinal type covering epithelium (right side) comprising of crowded columnar cells with basal, hyperchromatic nuclei and large amounts of apical mucin as well as minimal dysplastic changes. Marked fibrosis beneath the epithelial lining is readily apparent. *Fibrosis and chronic inflammation are secondary changes due to luminal compression in a long-standing disease."
