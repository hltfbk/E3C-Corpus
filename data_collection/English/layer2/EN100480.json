  "text": "A 54 years old Moroccan man presented to our otolaryngology (ENT) department with a 5 months history of worsening bilateral nasal obstruction, anosmia and rhinorrhea from both nostrils without epistaxis, associated with progressive bilateral hearing loss. His past medical history included undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx (UNCT) diagnosed on 2001, American Joint Committee for Cancer TNM staging of T1N0M0. He received a course of radiotherapy (65 Grays). The patient had no other significant past medical history. On examination, patient was breathing with mouth open. A cold spatula test showed absence of air flow on left nostril and minimal air flow on the right side. Rigid endoscopic nasal examination revealed a complete choanal stenosis in the left side and incomplete in the right side. There were no signs of tumor recurrence. Otoscopic examination showed signs of fibro-adhesive otitis and tonal audiometry showed mixed deafness. The computed tomography (CT) scan of the nose and paranasal sinuses was done, and showed a stenosis of the light of the two choanae by tissue density lesion in both choanae of 7.30mm. The patient underwent endoscopic surgery under general anesthesia, where the fibrous obstacle was resected and widening of the posterior choanal stenosis. A 5mm diameter tube was placed in both nasal cavities and kept for 3 weeks to ensure a good calibration and prevent the recurrence of the stenosis. The anatomopathological study did not show signs of tumor recurrence or specific inflammation. Deafness has been treated by bilateral hearing aids. The evolution was marked by the improvement of the clinical symptomatology with restitution of the nasal ventilation and the smell. An endoscopic control after 6 months of the surgical procedure did not find any sign of restenosis with a rather satisfactory choanal light."
