  "text": "A 53-year-old woman with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes and asthma developed a nasal septum abscess after a bilateral endoscopic ethmoidectomy performed for sinonasal polyposis. She was then treated with oral and nasal corticosteroids. Ten days after surgery, she developed a bilateral nasal obstruction with fever without any postoperative trauma. Upon physical examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 37.8Â°C. Anterior rhinoscopy showed a bulging anterior nasal septum bilaterally. The rest of physical examination presented no evidence of orbital, neurological, oral or facial involvement. Laboratory tests showed leucocytosis at 1520 cells/mm 3 with neutrophilic predominance at 1010 cells/mm 3 and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 100mg/l. The computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a fluid collection with thin rim enhancement in the anterior nasal septum without complications such as intracranial, facial or orbital extensions. Pus from the nasal septum was collected by needle aspiration, and sent to microbiology culture. Empirical antimicrobial therapy with intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and gentamicin was initiated. Final cultures were positive for Aspergillus flavus and no bacteria were detected. Pus from the nasal septum was cultured twice and the results were similar in both cultures. The patient was tested human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative. Operative drainage of nasal septum abscess was performed under general anesthesia by incision, debridement and nasal packing. The chosen therapy was oral voriconazole 200mg twice a day for one week followed by fluconazole 150 mg daily for one month. Insulin therapy was started for improvement and maintenance of glycemic control. On the one hand, clinical and biological improvement was achieved with the disappearance of clinical signs and normalization of the complete blood count and the CRP, on the other hand, the patient developed a saddle nose deformity one month after surgery. Her case has been followed up for 18 months and there has not been any recurrence of the infection."
