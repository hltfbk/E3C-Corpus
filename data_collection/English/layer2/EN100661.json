  "text": "A five-year-old girl presented to the pediatric emergency room with acute onset of pain of the right lower limb, coldness of the limb and inability to use the limb. The patient was given benzathine penicillin intramuscular injection on the same limb for acute on chronic tonsillitis 8 hours prior to presentation. The right lower limb pain was associated with coldness of the limb and dark discoloration. The pain and discoloration were said to be getting worse with time. However, there was no history of fevers, trauma, sickle cell disease or bleeding tendencies. Examination revealed swollen right lower limb with dark discoloration from the toes to mid-thigh as in Figure 1. The leg was cold with weak popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulses compared to the contralateral limb. Sensation was intact and power was zero. Systemic examination was unremarkable. A diagnosis of compartment syndrome of the right thigh secondary to Nicolau syndrome was made. Investigations done were full blood count (FBC), urea, electrolytes, creatinine, liver enzymes, INR and doppler ultrasound of the right lower limb. FBC results were normal. Urea and creatinine were elevated 13.5mmol/l and 242.2umol/l respectively. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were 997.7U/L and 115.6IU/L. International normalization ratio (INR) was 1.57. An emergency fasciotomy was done 24hrs after presentation after surgeons reviewed the patient and intra-op findings were osteofascial compartment bulging on first incision with free clear fluid and minimal bleeding as shown in Figure 2. Patient was then started on broad spectrum antibiotics; imipenem 250mg thrice a day (TDS) IV and metronidazole 200mg IV and analgesia, tramadol 25mg twice a day intramuscular (B.D IM). The acute kidney injury (AKI) was managed conservatively by restricting fluid intake and avoiding nephrotoxic drugs. AKI resolve after 5 days with urea and creatinine dropping to 3.36mmol/l and 37.26umol/l. ALT and AST also dropped to 64.1U/L and 180.3IU/l with albumin of 18.5g/l. However, there was no improvement in the perfusion of the right leg and foot two days after fasciotomy. A diagnosis of dry gangrene was made and patient was planned for a below knee amputation but parents denied consent. The parents continued being counselled on the need for an amputation. After 4 days post fasciotomy, patient started having spiking temperatures despite being on imipenem. The swelling worsened with intense pain in the right thigh and right thigh skin started developing blisters. A diagnosis of dry gangrene with superimposed wet gangrene was made 13 days after fasciotomy as indicated in Figure 3. Parents were counselled for an above knee amputation but consent was denied again. Patient developed convulsions which were attributed to raised body temperatures. The seizures were controlled by diazepam 7mg intravenous (I.V) stat. Four days later, the parents accepted for an above knee amputation (AKA) to be done. The AKA was done and intra-op findings were cooked muscles of the right thigh due to poor perfusion. Patient was then put on ceftriaxone, metronidazole and tramadol. The temperatures settled after the AKA. Wound was then exposed after 24hrs and daily cleaning was ordered. The patient was later discharge and she is currently undergoing occupational therapy sessions at the physiotherapy department as in Figure 4."
