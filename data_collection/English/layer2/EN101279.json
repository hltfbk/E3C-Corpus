  "text": "A 22-year-old Chinese man presented a combination of kissing molars, maxillary bilateral supernumerary teeth and macrodontia. Radiographically, two maxillary bilateral distomolars located at the buccal side of adjacent third molars. One mandibular distomolar with the adjacent third molar was contacted by occlusal surfaces while roots were pointed oppositely, which could be diagnosed as KM. Furthermore, the left mandibular third molar can be inferred to be a macrodontia, characterized by a large crown and tapering root. After a thorough investigation, we excluded the possibilities of systemic diseases and genetic inheritance. However, the etiology of this rare combination deserves to be further explored."
