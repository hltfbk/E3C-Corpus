  "text": "Patient A was 91 years old with known pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular systolic dysfunction who presented in septic shock requiring vasopressor support. Hepatic and portal vein Dopplers were consistent with right heart failure and significant venous congestion, therefore, diuresis was initiated which resulted in portal flow normalization, renal recovery, and cessation of vasopressor support. Patient B was 82 years old with severe idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis on home oxygen who presented in decompensated right heart failure. Despite aggressive diuresis, a negative fluid balance was not achieved. The patient continued to deteriorate and prior to their death portal vein, Doppler showed significant flow reversal."
