  "text": "We present the clinical case of a 41-year-old Caucasian man undergoing chronic hemodialysis, who had a parathyroidectomy to treat severe secondary hyperparathyroidism resistant to cinacalcet treatment. Preoperatively, 24 months after high-dose cinacalcet hydrochloride, we observed a persistently elevated intact parathyroid hormone serum level, and detected clear parathyroid gland hyperplasia regression on ultrasound. We performed a three-gland parathyroidectomy, which was assumed to be total, associated with a hemithyroidectomy. Our patient then entered a hypoparathyroid state. A histopathological examination showed that the removed parathyroid glands were of small size, with a total weight of 1g, associated with a multifocal small papillary thyroid cancer."
