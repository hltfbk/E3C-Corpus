  "text": "A 70 year old man of Indian origin presented to the outpatient department with complaints of pain, limited mobility and swelling over anterior aspects of the right leg, above the ankle for three months. He gave a history of recurrent ulcer over the same region. There was no history of loss of sensation, no history of trauma, no comorbid illness, no history of fever, no gastrointestinal/respiratory symptoms. Clinical examination of the right leg showed a well demarcated erythematous firm lesion with nodular surrounding areas and accompanying lymphedema of the distal foot. Thorough clinical examination of the entire body revealed no other lesion. There was no past history of similar lesions anywhere in the body. No other skin/oral lesions were identified. Additional investigations showed he was not immunocompromised or did not suffer from any sexually transmitted diseases. Plain radiograph of the leg (antero posterior and lateral views) showed a lobulated soft tissue swelling in the anterior aspect of the lower one third of the leg with few calcific areas within and associated periosteal reaction the adjacent bones of the leg. Computerised tomography (CT) of the same patient shows areas of soft tissue edema, heterogeneous linear densities and few areas of faint calcification in the region of the lobulated skin lesion. Thick unicortical periosteal reaction of the tibia for a short segment; adjacent to the lesion was noted. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed findings similar to the CT findings and shows no bone marrow involvement. The lesion appeared iso to hypo intense on T1 weighted images and hyper intense on T2 weighted images and was located within the skeletal muscle. Surrounding perilesional edema was noted. There was no bone marrow involvement. A biopsy of the lesion was performed and showed histopathological features of Kaposi sarcoma."
