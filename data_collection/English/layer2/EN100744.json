  "text": "We report the case of a 61-year-old man who presented with a 3-month history of atraumatic right knee pain localized to the suprapatellar region. Pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of loose bodies at the suprapatellar region behind the complete septum. Loose bodies were concealed in a sealed suprapatellar pouch and could not be detected by routine arthroscopic examination of the knee cavity. The suprapatellar plica was punctured and loose bodies trapped within the enclosed suprapatellar compartment were arthroscopically removed. Histological examination of the loose bodies confirmed the diagnosis of osteochondromatosis. The patient postoperatively experienced complete relief of knee pain."
