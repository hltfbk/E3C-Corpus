  "text": "A 72-year-old former “heavy” smoker (365 packs / year until 10 years ago) was referred to our service, presenting with a dry cough occurring at night and which has lasted for a year. The patient did not report any concept of shortness of breath, night sweats, fever or weight loss. No additional illnesses were found in the medical history. During the clinical pulmonary examination, lung sounds were normally perceived on both sides. Lung function tests were also normal. Laboratory tests involving white blood cell count (5.31x10 3 / L), sedimentation rate and CRP were normal. Radiologically; an irregular density was observed in the lower segment of the right lung on the chest X-ray. A thorax CT was requested. It showed a solid mass of 27x36 mm with speculated irregular contours, in the posterior basal segment of the lower lobe of the right lung. Irregularity in the contour of the inner wall of the adjacent bronchi and bronchiectasis in the neighboring areas have also been observed. Furthermore, there was a distortion of the adjacent pleura. Ancillary radiological results supported the theory of the chronic process and therefore malignancy was considered. Due to the suspicion of a malignant process, a bronchoscopy was performed and a PET CT was requested. In PET CT; Low grade FDG (Fluoro-2-deoxy-2-d-glucose) uptake was present. [SUV (standardized uptake value): 1.8]. In bronchoscopy, the left bronchial system was open at the subsegmental level. The mucosa of the right lower lobe bronchi was coarse and irregular. Lower lobe posterior basal segment bronchus (RB 10) was successfully reached. Brushing was done from the apical region of this area. Broncho aspiration samples were obtained and sent for ARB (acid-resistant bacillus) research. No endobronchial lesion was observed. Transbronchial biopsy was performed. In the histopathological examination of the small bronchial biopsies under the light microscope; moderate inflammation composed of predominantly lymphocytes, plasmocytes and a few neutrophils and eosinophils were seen in the wall of one bronchi. Reactive changes were seen in the bronchial epithelium. In the second biopsy; there was a patchy involvement composed of a loose fibroblastic plug filling an air space. This plug had typically elongated, spindle and stellate fibroblasts embedded in a pale-staining matrix. Some fibrin deposits were seen around. Final interpretation of pathologist was; with all of these histopathological findings it was thought that the case may be compatible with Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia (Or if the case is idiopathic; Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia) if clinical and radiological findings support it. There was significant regression in the lesion on 2-month follow-up radiographs without any treatment. No predisposing factor to explain the patient's clinic was detected. Organizing pneumonia diagnosis was evaluated as cryptogenic. Pathology, clinical and radiological findings were in favor of the COP."
