  "text": "A 54-years-old woman presented with a history of right mastectomy for a breast cancer 14 years previously, and radio-chemotherapy for squamous cells carcinoma of the cervix 12 years ago, and a cholecystectomy 5 years ago. She consulted for a winged right scapula since 1 year. In recent months the lesion had increased in size and caused discomfort and even pain in response to exercise. Physical examination revealed bilateral masses that became manifest on abducting and flexing arms. Both lesions were grossly rounded, of rubber-like consistency, not adhering to the skin but adhesive to deep structures, measuring about 9 cm in diameter, and slightly painful (the pain was reported mainly in the right side). Ultrasound showed a homogeneous well limited echogenic avascular structure measuring 67 x 30 mm. Magnetic resonance imaging set the diagnosis by revealing bilateral soft tissue tumors regarding the tip of the scapula, roughly symmetrical and poorly circumscribed with dimensions 77 x 21 mm in the right side and 83 x 21 mm in the left one. The masses consisted of elements with linear fibrillary signaling which intensity was equal to muscles in T1 and T2. Hypersignaling bands in T1 and T2 were also dispersed among them with intensity equal to fat. No signs of malignancy were observed, particularly absence of bone invasion. The MRI data were compatible with elastofibroma dorsi.\nSurgical excision was performed under general anesthesia on prone position and with abducted arms. An incision was made over the palpable masses and the ill-defined tumors were removed. Macroscopically, the lesions were non encapsulated, with whitish fibrous tracts alternating with yellowish tissue of fatty consistency. The histological study revealed a benign proliferation composed of collagen and elastic fibers, associated with some fibroblasts and fat cells. The elastic fibers were fragmented into globules or had a linear arrangement. The surgical excision was complete.\nThe post operative course was without complications, and the patient was discharged 3 days after surgery."
