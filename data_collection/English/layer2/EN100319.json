  "text": "A 20 years old female patient, the sixth of a family of 8 children is treated since 2010 for edematous-ascitic syndrome related to a primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (or Wildmannâ€™s disease) suspected by hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia and hypogammmaglobulinemia. The disease was confirmed by an intestinal biopsy indicating dilated lymphatic ducts Figure 1, Figure 2. The patient followed a low-fat diet associated with medium-chain triglycerides, vit A and K supplementations. The evolution was good with effusions resorption. However, 6 months ago, the patient presented MRC grade 3 dyspnea with alternated fever and apyrexia. It appeared after she chose to stop, 8 months ago, the low fat diet that was prescribed by her pediatrician.\nThe physical exam revealed a cachectic, apyretic patient with BMI of 17kg / m 2, WHO performance index of 1, a minor Conjunctivial discoloration and a RR of 22 B/min.\nThe lung exam showed a bilateral fluid effusion syndrome. The cardiovascular exam indicated a pericardial rub with a systolic murmur at the mitral area. The abdominal exam found a shifting dullness with a smoothed umbilicus. The skin exam showed a thin skin with no dehydration signs, skin lesions or edema.\nSuspected diagnoses were: Tuberculosis, type B Lymphoma, Disseminated Lupus erythematosus.\nParaclinical tests showed a moderate inflammatory syndrome. The AFB sputum examination by direct microscopy, the tuberculin skin test, the 24h proteinuria and the immunological tests were negative.\nThe thoracentesis revealed a lymphocytic exudative fluid with no MTB in the pleural fluid (direct microscopy) and a negative ADA level.\nThe abdominal ultrasound showed medium-abundance ascites associated with an abundant pleurisy and a renal cyst.\nHeart ultrasound reveals a pericardial effusion with a normal ejection fraction.\nHowever, no causal factor has been found in either thoracoabdominal CT scan, bronchoscopy or thoracoscopy."
