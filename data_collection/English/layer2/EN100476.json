  "text": "This was a 13-year-old boy monitored in the unit since 2017-10-04 for stage V Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) following a primary nephrotic syndrome by Segmental and Focal Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) cortico-resistant and cyclo-resistant since he was 11 years old. The patient was anuric with diuresis at 0.19ml/kg/h. He weighed 32kg and measured 131cm with a normal BMI for his age. He had delayed pubertal development (P1G3). Faced with signs of intolerance in uremia, he first received two successive sessions of haemodialysis then three sessions per week for over 3 months in an adult center. He was switched to CAPD following his parents' choice motivated by a desire to return home situated 121km from Dakar. The TENCKOFF catheter was inserted on 2018-03-05 in urology in collaboration with the pediatrics and adult nephrology team. On day 1 after catheter insertion, the peritoneal cavity was rinsed. On day 2 after insertion, the patient had a fever at 39oC, abdominal pain and greenish vomiting. Upon examination, he would scream when his navel is touched. Analysis of the drainage liquid had revealed 650 leucocytes/mm 3 with 62% of neutrophils. The dialysate culture was sterile. The hemoculture came back negative. The nasal swab isolated Staphylococcus aureus. The patient received 1g of C3G in each bag of 2L of dialysate associated with a bacitracin+neomycine nasal rub as from day 2 after catheter insertion. The plan proposed to the patient was 4 swabs a day (8am - 12noon - 4pm - 8pm - 8am) with a stasis of isotonic dialysate of 4 hours per session during the day and a stasis of icodextrin for 8 hours at night. The total time for dialysis was 24 h/day and the volume of injection per cycle was 1L of dialysate. The peritoneal control fluid at day 7 was sterile (leucocytes 21 elements/mm 3 with 95% lymphocytes). The antibiotic treatment was done by oral route for 14 days. Besides the PD, the patient was receiving anti-hypertensive treatment, water restriction, active calcium and vitamin D supplementation, erythropoietin and a CKD diet. After the infection period, an equilibration Test (PET test) revealed a Hyper-permeable peritoneal membrane with D/P creatinine at 0.91. The patient and his mother were trained and assessed on the PD technique. By the end of a month, they had become independent and could recognize the signs or dysfunction of the catheter. Patient assessment during this first month of dialysis revealed an adequate clinical and biological condition (Table 1). The patient and his mother returned home at Bambey, a town situated 121km from Dakar with a tracking sheet in which the weight, blood pressure, temperature and ultra filtrate are noted. After a second month of observation, the patient complained of abdominal pain at the day hospital. The plain abdominal X-ray revealed a catheter migration to the right. The catheter was repositioned in the patient through the use of laxatives. After 4 months of observation, the dialysis was considered adequate on a clinical and biological basis (Table 1)."
