  "text": "Mrs. CD, a 27 year old Para 2 gravida 3 patient was referred from a district hospital with a diagnosis of multiple pregnancy with intrauterine demise of a co-twin at 26 weeks gestation. She had no complaints at presentation and had not experienced excessive symptoms of pregnancy earlier on in the pregnancy. She believed her abdomen was growing at a normal rate and she had felt quickening a few weeks before. The pregnancy was planned and she booked the pregnancy at the district hospital a week prior to presentation. She had normal vaginal deliveries of her first 2 children with no antepartum or intrapartum complications but was diagnosed with chronic hypertension during her 6 week post-natal visit after delivery of her second child. She was started on enalapril and nifedipine but she defaulted treatment 2 months before falling pregnant. Her method of contraception was a combined oral contraceptive (Lofeminal) which she stopped taking one month before she fell pregnant. Nifedipine and methyldopa were commenced at 26 weeks gestation when the blood pressure was noted to be elevated and the blood pressure was well controlled thereafter. Clinical examination was unremarkable. An ultrasound scan showed monochorioinic diamniotic twins with normal liquor volume in the viable twin but there was gross oedema of the foetal skin and no skull bones in the non-viable twin. Later scans suggested that the foetal parts were encapsulated in a cystic mass suggestive of a partial mole. Umbilical artery doppler studies showed similar indices for both foetuses and there was no mention of reversed flow in the scans at 26 weeks. A plan to manage her expectantly was made and she was followed up by two weekly ultrasound scan and doppler velocimetry. The patient was counselled on the risks for preterm birth, cardiac failure and higher perinatal mortality associated with the condition. She was counselled for an elective caesarean section (CS) once the foetus reached viability. Follow up scans and doppler velocimetry showed that growth of the pump twin was below the 5 th percentile but the weight of the acardiac twin was difficult to estimate and not recorded. The amniotic fluid volume remained normal in serial scans. At 34 weeks there was absent diastolic flow in the umbilical artery. The patient received corticosteroids and had a lower segment CS. A live baby girl with a birth weight of 1370g and Apgar score of 7/10 at 1 minute and 8/10 at 5 minutes was delivered. The acardiac twin weighed 3000g. The pump twin had respiratory distress syndrome for 3 days after delivery and was weaned off oxygen by day 4. She had no obvious congenital anomalies."
