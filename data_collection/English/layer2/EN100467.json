  "text": "It consists in a 64-year-old female patient presented with persistent polyuria and polydipsia during the last 4 years with difficulties to walk. She had no history of diabetes mellitus, cranial trauma or surgery. The patient had consulted several times before referring her to the internal medicine and endocrinology department for polyuria-polydipsia syndrome investigation.\nPhysical examination showed eyelid xanthelasmas and cerebellar ataxia. Diabetes mellitus was ruled out on routine workup and assessment of anterior pituitary functions was normal. After a water deprivation test combined with Desmopressin administration, central diabetes insipidus was confirmed. Hypothalamo-pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no pituitary stalk abnormalities but the loss of hyperintense signal on sagittal T1 weighted imaging. It also showed white matter nodular hyper intensities on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) brain MRI. Because of this association (diabetes insipidus, cerebellar ataxia, and xanthelasmas), diagnosis of ECD was suspected.\nBone involvement was investigated by Tc 99m methyl-diphosphonate (MDP) scintigraphy that showed symmetric uptake in both tibias, on the left radius and on the left femur. Proximal tibia bone biopsy was then performed. Histopathological findings showed bone infiltration by foamy histiocytes with fibrosis. Immuno-histochemical staining was positive for CD68 and negative for CD1a.\nOnce the diagnosis was confirmed, the involvement of other organs was assessed by transesophageal echocardiography that showed a left ventricular hypertrophy and pericardial effusion, while thoracoabdominal tomodensitometry showed pericardial thickening with minimal pericardial effusion. The aorta, adrenal glands and kidneys were normal. There were no pulmonary abnormalities or retroperitoneal infiltration.\nThe patient was initially treated with Prednisone (1mg/kg/day). Three months later, she developed corticosteroids-induced diabetes that responded well to treatment with Metformin and Insulin NPH. Corticosteroids was gradually stopped and pegylated IFN-α was initiated at the dose of 180 µg/ week. After 9 months of treatment, patient was clinically stable and there is no disease progression."
