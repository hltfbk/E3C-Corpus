  "text": "Mrs. DOJ is a 30 year old G2P1+0 primary school teacher who first presented to the clinic at 18 weeks of gestation by ultrasound scan since she was not sure of her LMP. She presented to the clinic because of the gastroenteritis in pregnancy and was managed with intravenous fluids, metronidazole and haematinics. She eventually came back to the clinic to book at about 32 weeks of gestation and she claimed she has not had any antenatal care nor medications prior booking. Examination revealed a healthy-looking woman with symphysiofundal height of 32 weeks and fetus was alive. Ultrasound scan revealed a live fetus in longitudinal lie and breech presentation. Placental was antero-fundal and there was polyhydramnios (AFI of 205mm). There was gross incompatibility between the biparietal diameter and the femur length which prompted the diagnosis of some form of skeletal dysplasia. She was referred for comprehensive fetal anomaly scan. The repeat scan showed remarkable lordosis and the skull had a clover leaf appearance. All the long bones were significantly shortened. The measured parameters showed biparietal diameter (BPD) to be 78mm, corresponding to 30 weeks 4 days and femur length to be 22mm, corresponding to 16 weeks 1 day. The estimated fetal weight was 834g. Polyhydramnios was still present and single pocket of amniotic fluid measured 10cm. A diagnosis of generalized skeletal dysplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia was made. Based on the ultrasound scan (USS) result she was counselled for termination of pregnancy which she declined. She however re-presented to the clinic at about 39 weeks of gestation with a satisfactory state of health. Abdominal examination showed a symphysiofundal height (SFH) of 37cm. Abdominal examination revealed a baby in breech presentation. The fetal heart wasnot heard which was confirmed by USS. She was scheduled for induction of labour which she consented to. Cervical ripening with Foleys catheter was done followed by induction of labour with misoprostol. Polyhydramnios was confirmed during artificial rupture of membranes; liquor was pot-wine coloured and the fetus was eventually expelled by breech delivery with a weight of 2.9kg. Thebaby was macerated with micromelia and the face had striking odd facie with dilated sutures and disproportionately big clover-leaf -shaped head, a short neck and mild proptosis with low set ears. Musculoskeletal system in addition showed short stubby spade like fingers and the palate was high arched. The abdomen was distended and hyperaemic with thin umbilical cord. On palpation, the abdomen was soft and; the liver was about 3cm enlarged below the costal region. The male genitalia was well developed. The parents rejected autopsy but accepted that the baby be donated for the teaching of students. A complete X-ray of the body of the baby (Babygram) showedmacrocephaly, narrowed chest with flattened ribs. All the vertebral bodies were reduced in height and appeared widened. The iliac bones were hypoplastic and all the long bones were shortened but straightened. There wasassociated metaphyseal flaring. A diagnosis of Thanatophoric dysplasia type II was made."
