  "text": "A 51 year-old women came to the emergency department with right abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and fever at (38°C). The pain did not radiate to any other site and did not change with various positions. The Physical examination revealed a McBurney's point, without psoas signs.\nThe biological assessment showed leukocytosis at 16200/m 3.\nThe ultrasound study showed a free fluid in the right lower quadrant with a non-compressible structure over the iliac vessels suggesting an acute appendicitis.\nAn appendectomy was performed by McBurney's incision. The patient was discharged two days later without any complications. Pathology report showed an acute appendicitis with periappendicular reaction. 12 days later, the Patient came back with lump in the right iliac fossa with pain and high grade fever. The physical exam found localized fixed mass in the Right Iliac Fossa. Blood exams revealed 14,000 White Blood Cells with 80% Neutrophiles. A C-reactive protein level was at 112 mg/L.\nThe ultrasonography was showing localized collection in Right Iliac Fossa. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 10cm × 4.7 cm fluid collection in the psoas, associated with inflammatory changes in the local fat and a small amount of free liquid in the right parietocolic area. A Computer tomography (CT) scan-guided percutaneous aspiration of the abscess has been performed and a catheter to drain the abscess was placed.\nOn the third day, an enterocutaneous fistula was observed and a long tapeworm emerged from the McBurney's incision. The cestode was removed attentively in a single piece.\nThe fistula was managed conservatively and the patient was discharged on 15 th post-operative day after she received a single dose of niclosamide (4x500 mg).\nTwo weeks later, she returned without any pain or fever. The fistula was dried out and the wound was properly healed without any signs of ongoing infection. The parasitological exam revealed Teania saginata."
