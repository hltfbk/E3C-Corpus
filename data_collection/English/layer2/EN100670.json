  "text": "Female patient, from Morocco, has 3 years, non-consanguineous, the second of two siblings, was referred to the medical genetic department of the Mohammed VI University Hospital in Marrakech for a dysmorphic syndrome, seizures, delayed growth, hypothyroidism and hypotonia.\nThe parents and the older sister were healthy, 38-year-old mother and 40-year-old father. The girl was resulting from a followed pregnancy, carried to term, without notion of teratogenic drug intake. The delivery took place by cesarean section (oligo-amnios + acute fetal pain), with intra-uterine growth retardation: birth weight=1 Kg 850, size=44 cm, cranial perimeter=33 cm and neonatal hypotonia. The girl presented a neonatal infection, developmental delay, transient hypothyroidism treated for 05 months with the notion of a single convulsive attack at the age of 05 months without treatment. The clinical examination revealed: a microcephaly (cranial perimeter=44 cm (-2 standard deviation)), low body weight (weight=7 Kg (-3 standard deviation)),short stature (size=80 cm (-2 standard deviation)); hypotonia, the horizontal eyebrows, sunken eyes, no space between the eyebrows and the eyes, a worried look, a hypertelorism, the broad root of the nose, midface hypoplasia, the erased philtrum an ogival palate, brachydactyly, clinodactyly of the fifth finger and a bilateral valgus of the feet. The patient underwent whole skeleton radiographs showing delayed bone age. There were no other malformations or organ dysfunctions. In front of the facial dysmorphia and other clinical features as well as the radiological explorations the diagnosis to evoke in our patient is the deletion syndrome 1p36. A molecular cytogenetic study, by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), specific locus probe set (LSI p58 (1p36) spectrum orange/telvysion 1p spectrum green/LSI 1q25 spectrum aqua) was performed and confirmed the presence of a heterozygous microdeletion in 1p36:ish del (1) (p36p36) (p58-/tel 1p-)."
