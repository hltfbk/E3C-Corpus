  "text": "Mrs XY. is 23 year old, nulliparous woman who was wheeled to the emergency service of the gynaeco-obstetrical unit of the hospital for severe abdominal pains of sudden unset followed by dizziness and loss of stability leading to a fall and collapsed. She has no amenorrhea and her hemoglobin electrophoresis is AA. She has no particular medical or surgical past history.\nInterrogation reveals her last coitus some minutes before onset of symptoms after 2years of forced abstinence (fiancé abroad), no accident or fall, and no fight.\nPhysical examination reveals conserved general state, unstable hemodynamic parameters (BP 70/50mmHg, pulse 100bpm, temperature 37.3°C). Her conjunctivae were coloured with a distended abdomen especially in the pelvic region of hemoperitoneum confirmed by an abdominal tap (7milliliters of unclotted blood). Vaginal exams (digital and speculum) reveal no bleeding, no pelvic mass but tender with bulging pouch of Douglas. A presumptive working diagnosis of a ruptured hemorrhagic ovarian cyst was considered.\nAn emergency pre-operative work-up (FBC, PT, and CKT) was performed as routine and she was prepared for exploratory laparotomy under general anesthesia. Two units (500 milliliters /unit) of Blood were also reserved. During surgery, we found hemoperitoneum of about 2500 milliliters of fresh blood, a clean pelvis with neither adhesions nor a pathologic tube or ovary. Extension of the incision anteriorly for abdominal exploration reveals a macroscopically healthy liver but the spleen presents lacerations at 3 points posteriorly (2-4cm) that were actively bleeding (grade 3).\nTotal splenectomy was done with the help of abdominal surgeons. Peritoneal toileting with closure of the abdominal wall followed. Her post-operative period was uneventful on antibiotics and antalgics until her discharge after 7days of hospitalization. Neither pathological examination of the splenectomy material nor postoperative consultations with the hematology and infectious diseases departments showed any pathology to explain the rupture. Vaccination against certain predisposed infections (like pneumococcus infection was also advised."
