  "text": "A 54 years old female patient (weight 108 kg height 162 cm, body mass index (BMI) = 41.2 kg/cm ²) was submitted for laparoscopic adjustable gastric band in September 2001. Her comorbidities include non-insulin dependent diabetes and hypertension. The post-operative course reported to be straightforward with no immediate complications. However she started to be followed up in other hospital with no available documented data about reduction in weight in the few years after the surgery. At September 2009, she presented to the emergency department complaining of fever, periumblical pain and swelling. On examination there is superficial periumblical swelling and tenderness. Blood tests revealed leukocytosis. Abdominal contrast enhanced CT scan showed 6.5 X 4.5cm fluid collection surrounding the access port. Under general anesthesia, incisional drainage and access-port removal was performed. The remaining part of connecting tube left in the abdominal cavity. The patient covered with antibiotic regimen and released from the hospital few days later doing well. Three months later, the patient presented again to the emergency department with colicky abdominal pain and abdominal distention. Supine and erect abdomen x-ray revealed small bowel dilatation and multiple air-fluid levels. Interestingly, the gastric band and its connecting tube seen in the lower abdomen at midline probably in the distal ilial loops. The patient was given oral contrast (Gastrografin®) and contrast enhanced abdomen CT scan performed later. It showed resolution of bowel dilatation with the band and its connecting tube noted at transverse / descending colon. Few hours later the patient started to have rectal pain and X-ray requested. It showed that the gastric band at rectal area. Per rectal examination performed and the gastric band removed with no difficulties.
