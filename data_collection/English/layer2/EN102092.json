  "text": "We report our observations of three unrelated Moroccan patients referred to our genetics department for molecular diagnosis of epilepsy: a 4-year-old Moroccan boy, a 3-year-old Moroccan girl, and a 7-year-old Moroccan boy. Due to the heterogeneity and complexity of epilepsy, we performed clinical exome sequencing followed by targeted analysis of 936 epilepsy genes. A total of three mutations were identified in known epilepsy genes (SCN1A, SCN2A). By clinical exome sequencing, we identified two novel mutations: c.4973C>A (p.Thr1658Lys) in SCN1A gene and c.1283A>G (p.Tyr428Cys) in the SCN2A gene, whereas the third mutation c.3295G>T (p.Glu1099*) was already described in patients with Dravet syndrome."
