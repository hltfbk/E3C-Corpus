  "text": "A 24 year old Asian female presented to the surgical clinic with a goitre of eight months duration and recent onset of altered bowel habits with features of anaemia. She was previously healthy and there was no family history of adenomatous polyposis, colorectal carcinoma or thyroid neoplasms. Colonoscopy revealed large bowel polyposis and fine needle aspiration of thyroid revealed a smear suspicious for malignancy. She underwent total thyroidectomy which revealed CMV PTC. Histology was characterized by a prominent cribriform pattern of growth with interspersed cell clusters arranged as morules along with papillary structures which are the key features of this subtype."
