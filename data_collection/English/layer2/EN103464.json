  "text": "A 45-year-old woman with a two-year history of ovarian endometriosis confirmed by ultrasound underwent oophorectomy. On microscopic examination, a focus of malignant stratified epithelium, initially interpreted as transitional cell carcinoma, was identified within the endometriotic cyst wall. Examination of the hysterectomy specimen revealed superficially invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix. In addition, two triploid, CD45-negative cells were detected during the analysis of the peripheral blood for circulating tumor cells (CTC). High-risk HPV was detected on the sections of endometriosis containing cancerous area by using hybrid capture 2 assay, supporting the diagnosis of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma originating from the uterine cervix."
