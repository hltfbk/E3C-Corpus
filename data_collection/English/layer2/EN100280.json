  "text": "A 34 year old pimigravida presented in our hospital on 20 October 2015 at period of gestation 13 weeks 2days for routine antenatal examination. On examination her height of uterus was found to be 30-32 weeks gestational size. On vaginal examination we could feel the uterus separately of about 12-14 weeks gestational size, beside this a huge mass of about 15 cm diameter filling whole abdomen was felt separately.\nUltrasonography showed an intrauterine viable fetus of 14 weeks 2 days Gestation with a large well defined hypoechoic abdominopelvic mass measuring 16x10 cm with minimum vascularity seen which was extending from right adenexa to right side of abdominal cavity upto right hypochondrium. A bridging vessel was seen extending from fundus of uterus to the mass lesion so 1st possibility of degenerated pedunculated fibroid was kept however right ovary was not seen separately from the mass lesion so the possibility of ovarian mass was also not ruled out. Patient was counselled regarding all possible outcomes of pregnancy along with this mass and she agreed to undergo exploratory laparotomy.On laparotomy a huge subserosal pedunculated fibroid arising from right fundic region of size 16x12x10 cm was found and removed. Following leiomyoma removal haemostasis was carefully achieved.\nFetal monitoring by ultrasonography was carried out immediately after surgery and fetus was found viable. Postoperative period was uneventful and patient was given tocolysis for 3 days with uterine relaxants and micronized progesterone was continued for 4 weeks.Patient was discharged on 10thpost operative day and followed up using ultrasonography 4 weekly till 38 weeks at which patient was admitted in hospital.Patient went into spontaneous labour at 39 weeks 1 day and delivered vaginally a male child weighing 3 kg with apgar score of 8 and 10.Mother and baby was discharged after 48 hours from the hospital."
