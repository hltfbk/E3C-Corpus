  "text": "A 41 years old patient, presented with epigastric pain and indigestion since 1 year. Physical examination and ultrasound abdomen were normal. A symptomatic treatment was prescribed without improvement. On physical examination the abdomen was soft, blood pressure was 130/85 mm Hg and pulse rate was 72 beats/min; sinus rhythm was normal. Blood count and biochemistry analysis were within normal limits. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed a left adrenal mass (2.5 X 3.4 cm); with a spontaneous density of 20 Hounsfield units (UH). The relative and absolute washouts were 10 % and 16 % respectively. Based on a density of 20 UH, the mass did not meet strict CT criteria for diagnosis of adenoma. Therefore, MRI was indicated for additional tumor characterization. It showed a left adrenal, well limited; with low-signal intensity on the T1-weighted image, and slightly high-signal intensity on the T2-weighted image; moderately enhanced after contrast. The calculation of the signal drop on the in-phase and out-phase sequences shows a value of less than 10%. The metabolic workup, including serum electrolytes, urinary metanephrine, was within the normal range. Also, a dexamethasone suppression test showed values within the normal range. Due to the suspect nature of the masse; a left adrenalectomy was indicated, which was performed via a transperitoneal laparoscopic approach. The histopathological and immunohistochemical study revealed the presence of a well-limited tumor of 3.3 X 2.9 cm. The tumor cells expressed PS 100. They did not express AML; the desmin; synaptophysin; chromogranin A or CD 117. This aspect is in favor of a benign tumor schwannoma type. The postoperative recovery was uneventful. A long term CT scanner follow-up at 6, 12, and 18 months will be necessary to get a recurrence."
