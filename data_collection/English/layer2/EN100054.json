  "text": "A 30-year-old Saudi gentleman who was admitted to the hospital for rehabilitation. Patient had a motor vehicle accident one month before admission which resulted in multiple injuries (including spinal cord injury and mild traumatic brain injury). He did not manifest behavioral or psychological problems during the initial four months stay at the hospital. Patient was supposed to be discharged from the hospital after achieving the rehabilitation goals. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and patient behavior In the beginning of the fourth month, the patient was referred to our psychiatric services from the spinal cord injury rehabilitation unit for evaluation and management of agitated combative behavior, he started to manifest abruptly one day after he was informed of imminent discharge. Physician in the ward, thought that this frustrated angry behavior was due to patient`s dissatisfaction of rehabilitation achievements. Detailed review found no prior psychiatric history, history of substance abuse and known exposure to neuroleptics. Patient had one previous episode of urinary tract infections (UTI) during his hospital stay that required treatment with oral antibiotics. On the first day of assessment, the patient`s initial signs and symptoms included a temperature of 38.4°C, agitated and combative behavior, refusing medication (including muscle relaxants) and oral intake and progressively deteriorating sleep. The provisional diagnosis was delirium due to a recurrent UTI. Olanzapine 10 mg IM stat was given and urinalysis (UA) was ordered. On the following day, (UA) revealed evidence of urinary tract bacterial infection for which an intravenous antibiotic was commenced. On the same day the patient continued to have agitated combative behavior for which he received haloperidol 10 mg IM in the afternoon (which calmed him down). On the third day the patient demonstrated a clear change in his mental state. His agitation decreased, however he began to show perplexed affect, distractibility and poor initiation of purposeful behavior. He was immobile and unresponsive, staring and not responding to verbal commands but responding to pain with purposeful withdrawal. Assessment of central nervous system (CNS) was difficult as the patient was constantly moving and had generalized spasticity. He responded to questions by uttering a few words and became very agitated, shouting obscenities. Laboratory results done on the same day showed the following results: white blood cell count: 18.2 cells/ml, serum creatinine: 93 µmol/L, fasting blood glucose : 8.37 mmol/l, calcium :2.59 mmol/l, phosphorus : 1.79 mmol/l, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) :162 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) :76 U/L, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT): 157 U/L, and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level : 4731 IU/L. The urine output was low at 350ml/12h. The patient was started on hydration and immediately transferred to ICU with differential diagnoses that included NMS and meningitis. Early the next morning the patient had a complex partial seizure which ceased after IV diazepam administration. Lumbar puncture (LP), computerized tomography (CT) of the head and electroencephalogram (EEG) did not indicate any significant findings. The diagnosis of NMS was retained, and the patient was started on bromocriptine 7.5 mg three times daily and lorazepam 1 mg at bedtime. On the 5th day after the (ICU) admission the patient demonstrated decreased rigidity and agitation and increased periods of wakefulness. On the 6th day patient regained a full level of orientation and cooperation. Liver function tests and CPK normalized and patient was transferred to the general ward."
