  "text": "A toddler boy was accidentally shot by an air shotgun at the forehead, and there was no sign of neurological deficit, both before and after surgical removal of the pellet. Herein, we report a case of air shotgun pellet which penetrated a toddler's head from the forehead, all the way up to the occiput. Removal of the pellet was successfully performed without eliciting any neurological sequelae."
