  "text": "We herein report a typical case of single S-1 administration after radical operation for colon cancer. The patient had no background or medical history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and only aortic and coronary atherosclerosis was revealed by computed tomography (CT) before surgery. He complained of sternum pain during the fifth cycle of S-1 treatment. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum cardiac marker cardiac troponin T (cTnT) strongly suggested ACS, which was possibly caused by S-1 cardiotoxicity."
