  "text": "The case is of a 21-year-old female presenting with right-sided hemiplegia and facial drooping. She had had an index presentation of throbbing headaches for the past 2 years, typical of a migraine but not preceded by any aura symptoms. However, in the current episode, the pain became excessively severe and accompanied by right-sided hemiplegia and facial drooping. A full investigation workup using MRI revealed evidence of infarct in the left temporoparietal and basal ganglion region."
