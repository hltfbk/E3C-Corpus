  "text": "A 76-year-old Chinese woman underwent continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis after the diagnosis of chronic renal failure. She presented with generalized abdominal pain after the start of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for 10 consecutive months. The pathogen was identified as Ewingella americana by microbiological examination and its susceptibility to antibiotics was partly different from the common pathogens causing peritonitis. The change of antibiotic treatment from vancomycin to amikacin accelerated her recovery."
