  "text": "A 58 year old male patient, caucasian race, was operated on video assisted minimally invasive mitral valve repair using right minithoracotomy approach. His past medical history included an uncontrolled hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, carotid arteries stenosis. The extracorporeal circulation was performed with femoral-femoral artery and venous approach. Negative pressure for vacuum assist venous drainage was applied in order to facilitate venous blood return. The patient had a brain monitoring with bilateral transcranial doppler of middle cerebral arteries and a double channels electroencephalogram. A three dimensional transesophageal echocardiography to evaluate the mitral valve repair was performed.During the cardiopulmonary bypass a significant microembolic activity was detected in the middle cerebral arteries spectrum velocities due to gas embolism from venous return. Simultaneous recording of microbubbles was also observed on the descending thoracic aorta transesophageal echo views."
