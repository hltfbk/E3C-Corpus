  "text": "A 26-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) with self-poisoning, having taken 30 tablets of slow-release KCl (total: 240 mmol potassium) following an auditory hallucination. The patient had been undergoing substitution therapy with NaCl and KCl for CCD and been followed up in the pediatric department. One month prior, she developed insomnia and anxiety and had consulted a psychiatrist. At the ED, although her general condition was good, she appeared agitated. Her serum potassium level was 7.0 mmol/L, indicating hyperkalemia, and electrocardiographic changes showed tenting of the T-waves. She responded to the administration of calcium gluconate, sodium bicarbonate, and insulin with glucose, and the serum potassium level improved. Finally, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia."
