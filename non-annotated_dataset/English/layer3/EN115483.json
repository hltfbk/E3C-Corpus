  "text": "A 72-year-old Japanese man was transferred to our hospital after recovering from ventricular fibrillation treated by using an automated external defibrillator. He had never complained of chest symptoms previously. Decreased uptake of I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine was observed in the inferolateral and anteroseptal walls of the left ventricle. A spasm provocation test of the coronary artery was performed, and silent coronary artery spasm was diagnosed as the underlying disease."
