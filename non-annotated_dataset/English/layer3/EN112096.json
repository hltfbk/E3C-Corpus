  "text": "A 38-year-old woman presented with mild hand tremor, scanning speech, nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia in the upper limbs, memory decline, tinnitus, and dizziness. An ophthalmologic examination indicated macular atrophy, pigment epithelium atrophy and choroidal capillary atrophy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the diffuse white matter involvement of specific white matter tracts. Decreased diffusion anisotropy was detected in various brain regions of the patient. Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) showed obviously thinner tracts of interest than in the controls, with a decreased fiber number (FN), increased radial diffusivity (RD) and unchanged axial diffusivity (AD). A novel homozygous c.2257C > T (p.Arg753Ter) mutation in exon 20 of the CLCN2 gene was identified."
