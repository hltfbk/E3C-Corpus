  "text": "We report a 55-year-old female who presented with shortness of breath, decreased effort tolerance, cough, and weight loss. Her initial chest X-ray and subsequent chest CT showed a 12 × 9 × 8 cm mass in the middle lobe of the right lung. The histopathological examination of her biopsy material was consistent with a thyroid transcription factor-1 positive lung adenocarcinoma. In the abdomen, a 5.3-cm mass was identified. A biopsy and immunohistochemistry revealed a lung adenocarcinoma. The patient was administered chemotherapy based on carboplatin-paclitaxel-bevacizumab, but only with a partial response. Six months later, the patient showed brain metastases. Therefore, a second-line treatment based on pemetrexed was administered for 9 courses, and a clinical and radiological response was observed. The chemotherapy was stopped and the patient did not exhibit any symptoms of progression while waiting for a new evaluation."
