  "text": "MHSEMS were placed in five patients with a malignant obstruction and one with post-endoscopic sphincterotomy bleeding. Each MHSEMS was successfully deployed in all cases. Patients showed no complications. Two cases were reviewed. Case 1: A 74-year-old male presented with jaundice and was diagnosed with a sigmoid colon cancer and giant liver metastases in the right liver lobe. A MHSEMS was placed in the left bile duct. The jaundice improved and peroral cholangioscopy was performed. Case 2: A 90-year-old female was admitted to hospital for jaundice and diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. A MHSEMS was placed in the left bile duct but after 8 months the stent became obstructed by tumor ingrowth. We treated the patient by ablation therapy. A silicone cover separated the internal bile duct from the surrounding tissue, protecting the latter from thermal injury during treatment by endobiliary ablation of the re-obstruction."
