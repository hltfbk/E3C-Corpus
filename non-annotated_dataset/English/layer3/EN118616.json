  "text": "In this case report we describe a 40 year-old patient who presented with 6 months history of progressively worsening and disabling osteomalacia as the only presentation of a celiac disease. With adherence to a gluten-free diet and calcium-vitamin D supplementation, the patient's condition improved remarkably within three months and she was able to walk pain free."
