  "text": "A 54-year-old Chinese man was referred to our hospital for discontinuous fatigue and unintentional weight loss for over one year. Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated serum CA 19-9 concentration of 39 IU/mL (reference interval, 0-37 IU/mL) over one year before admission. Afterwards, coagulopathy appeared, and the patient's serum CA 19-9 concentration increased continuously. At the time of admission, abdominal pain and haemorrhagic shock burst occurred, and emergency medical operation was performed. Laboratory investigations conducted upon admission showed a serum CA19-9 concentration of 392.56 IU/mL. Surgical resection of the spleen was undertaken, and pathological examination showed retiform haemangioendothelioma. The patient developed jaundice ten days after surgical excision of the spleen. Pathological examination of needle biopsy samples of the liver yielded a diagnosis of hepatic amyloidosis."
