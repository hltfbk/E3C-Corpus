  "text": "An otherwise healthy 35-year-old man presented with acute left-sided weakness. He had experienced left-sided posterior neck pain after a 4-hour flight 4 weeks previously. Physical examination was consistent with a left Brown-SÃ©quard syndrome. Magnetic resonance angiography showed evidence of left vertebral artery dissection. He improved after therapy with anticoagulants."
