  "text": "Here, we reported a case of a 60-year-old female with a 10-year history of gradually increasing mass in her left dorsal wrist. The EIP tendon was partially impaired by the mass.The patient was treated with surgical excision of the mass and reconstruction of the EIP tendon. The histopathological examination suggested the presence of GCTTS. After surgery, the patient had adequate functional recovery and no tumor recurrence after 2â€‰years' follow-up."
