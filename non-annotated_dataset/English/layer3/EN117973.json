  "text": "We report a case of malignant melanoma of the rectum in a 55-year-old Caucasian man presenting as an emergency with rectal bleeding. Biopsies were taken of the fleshy mass found on digital examination, which confirmed malignant melanoma. No distant metastases were found. He underwent an abdominoperineal resection. We report the surgical management of this rare and aggressive malignancy."
