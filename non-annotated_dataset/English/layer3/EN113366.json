  "text": "We report a case of a concurrent presentation of a branch duct ITPN and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) in the head of the pancreas, with a superior mesenteric artery (SMA) aneurysm. Initially, the cystic masses in the pancreatic head were diagnosed as branch duct IPMNs, with treatment consisting of a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, in combination with an aneurysmectomy performed for treatment of the SMA aneurysm. Pathological examination confirmed these cysts were a combination of branch-type ITPN and IPMN. The patient recovered from the treatment without complication, with no evidence of recurrence over a period of 34Â months post-surgery."
