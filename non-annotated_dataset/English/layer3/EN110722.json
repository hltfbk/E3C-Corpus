  "text": "A 38-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department in January of 2018 with profound anemia. A colonoscopy revealed innumerable colonic polyps. He reported having multiple family members diagnosed with colon cancer and was subsequently diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis with rectal sparing. Total abdominal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis was performed, revealing a T3N1a adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon. The patient subsequently underwent 12 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX. Surveillance imaging in late 2019 revealed a suspicious mass in the superior perirectal soft tissue without any other sites of potential disease. Completion proctectomy was performed in January 2020, 2 years after the initial resection. Pathology revealed a mesorectal tumor deposit located 1.5 cm distal to the ileorectal anastomosis. No evidence of mucosal involvement or nodal metastasis was identified."
