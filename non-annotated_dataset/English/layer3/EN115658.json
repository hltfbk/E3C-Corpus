  "text": "We herein report a case of a 30-year-old Sri-Lankan woman who presented with a 3-month history of left flank pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Imaging revealed a large left upper quadrant mass with a 1.8-cm left lung nodule. The differential diagnoses included a left adrenal mass, left upper pole renal mass, and retroperitoneal sarcoma. A functional adrenal work-up revealed no abnormal findings. Surgical excision of the mass was uneventful with no postoperative complications. Pathological analysis revealed a nonfunctioning adrenocortical carcinoma measuring 16 × 14 × 10 cm. To our knowledge, a mass of this size is among the largest nonfunctioning adrenocortical carcinomas reported in the published literature. The investigations and approach to treatment were consistent with those in the published literature."
