  "text": "A 66-year-old previously healthy male underwent an emergency palliative gastrectomy for a gastric obstructive tumor. The histologic examination and immunoprofile of tumor cells showed a mixed tumor that consisted of choriocarcinoma (90%) and moderate differentiated adenocarcinoma (10%), with hepatic metastases (Stage pT2NxM1L1V1R0) and microsatelite stable status. The patient died one month after surgery. The tumor cells showed focal positivity for CDX2 (adenocarcinoma component), HCG (choriocarcinoma) and CD138 (plasmacytoid carcinoma component) and were negative for HER-2, Î±-fetoprotein, VEGF, maspin and markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The gastric mucosa cells displayed positivity for CDX2, Hepar A and CD138. The complex immunoprofile and literature data synthesis prove that the gastric mucosa cells can present a multilineage differentiation."
