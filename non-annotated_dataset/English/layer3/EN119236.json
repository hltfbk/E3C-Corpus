  "text": "This report discusses a case of occult recurrent metastatic melanoma, isolated to three separate sites within the subcutaneous tissues of the left thigh region, which was not clinically apparent but was found on diagnostic restaging whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT scan utilizing an intravenous injection of 14.8 mCi 18F-FDG. Then, on the day of surgery, the patient received an intravenous injection of 12.8 mCi 18F-FDG. A multimodality approach of intraoperative handheld gamma probe detection, intraoperative ultrasound tumor localization, specimen PET/CT imaging, and postoperative PET/CT imaging was utilized for accomplishing and verifying the excision of all three sites of occult recurrent metastatic melanoma within the left thigh region."
