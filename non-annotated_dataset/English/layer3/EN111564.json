  "text": "A 22-year-old female patient with a known history of beta thalassemia presented with subacute onset of weakness and numbness of both lower limbs with a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the dorsal spine showed cord compression secondary to paraspinal EMH from T2 to T9 with most prominent compression over T5. She was managed with blood transfusion and low-dose radiotherapy."
