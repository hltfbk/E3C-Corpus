  "text": "We report the case of a 71-year-old woman who underwent a total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y reconstruction for a massive gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Postoperatively, she was making good progress and started consuming meals on postoperative day 3. However, on postoperative day 10, she complained of upper abdominal discomfort and nausea. Blood tests showed a mild inflammatory reaction. An upper gastrointestinal series showed obstruction of the elevated jejunum. An abdominal computed tomography scan suggested upper bowel obstruction. Endoscopic observation and repositioning was selected as an effective approach for treatment considering the patient's clinical condition and background. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed kinking of the elevated jejunum, easy passage through to the anal intestine, and no evidence of mucosal edema, stenosis of the Roux-en-Y anastomosis, bowel ischemia, or necrosis. After endoscopic repositioning, upper gastrointestinal series showed good passage of the jejunum and no evidence of bowel obstruction. At the 6-month follow-up examination, the patient was in good condition and had no complaints."
