  "text": "A 67-year-old lady was found to have poorly differentiated, high grade, pure large cell neuroendocrine tumor of the gallbladder after cholecystectomy for gallstones. After the diagnosis, staging workup showed a lesion in segment IVB/V of the liver, and chromogranin was elevated (982 mcg/L). The patient underwent central inferior hepatectomy and wedge excision of a lesion in segment III (discovered intra-operatively), with hilar lymphadenectomy. Three months after the first liver resection, she developed a new liver lesion II/III and underwent left lateral liver resection. The patient remained disease-free for 4 months following the second liver resection but then developed recurrent liver disease and was started on chemotherapy. Further progression led to multi-organ failure and death at 26 months from initial diagnosis."
