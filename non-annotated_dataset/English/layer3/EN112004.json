  "text": "We describe the case of a 43-year-old woman who was referred to us because of a slowly rising serum creatinine 4 years after kidney transplantation. As in the native kidney, the biopsy revealed an MPGN pattern of injury. The cause of this finding had not been established prior to transplantation leading to a classification as idiopathic MPGN in the past. Further workup at the time of presentation and allograft failure revealed chronic infection of a ventriculoatrial shunt as the most probable cause."
