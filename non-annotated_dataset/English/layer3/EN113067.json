  "text": "A 19 year-old, Norwegian male with a clinical diagnosis of Larsen syndrome and with healthy, non-consanguineous parents attended a reference center for rare connective tissue disorders. Findings at birth were hypotonia, joint hypermobility, hyperextended knees, adductovarus of the feet, cervical kyphosis, craniofacial abnormalities, and an umbilical hernia. From toddlerhood, he required a hearing aid due to combined conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Eye examination revealed hyperopia, astigmatism, and exotropia. At 10 years of age, he underwent emergency surgery for rupture of an ascending aortic aneurysm. At 19 years of age, a diagnostic re-evaluation was prompted by the findings of more distal aortic dilation, tortuosity of precerebral arteries, and skeletal findings. High throughput sequencing of 34 genes for hereditary connective tissue disorders did not identify any mutation in FLNB, but did identify a de novo missense mutation in TGFBR2 and a nonsense mutation in COL2A1 that was also present in his unaffected father. The diagnosis was revised to LDS Type 2. The patient also fulfills the proposed criteria for Stickler syndrome with bifid uvula, hearing loss, and a known mutation in COL2A1."
