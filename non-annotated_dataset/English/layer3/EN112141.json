  "text": "We describe herein the case of a 42-year-old woman with a 4-year history of a slow-growing, painful swelling on the posteromedial region of her left leg. Magnetic resonance imaging showed the presence of a huge mass occupying soleus muscle, compressing, and displacing anteriorly gastrocnemius muscle. After an incisional diagnostic biopsy, a complete surgical excision of the tumor was performed. On the basis of clinicoradiological and morphological findings, a diagnosis of EC was made."
