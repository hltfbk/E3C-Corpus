  "text": "We describe a 47-year-old Chinese woman who was confidently diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) after bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial lung biopsy. The patient received four sessions of bilateral whole lung lavage (WLL) and one session of WLL in combination with plasmapheresis, each only producing short-term symptomatic relief. The patient was given a trial of combination therapy, which consisted of WLL and Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) inhalation. The patient showed a gradual improvement in oxygenation and her daily activity, as well as a dramatic improvement in her pulmonary CT examination."
