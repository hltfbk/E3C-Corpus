  "text": "A 56-year-old Japanese man with lung cancer previously treated with surgery and chemotherapy was admitted with high fever, consciousness disorder, and motor aphasia. His first atezolizumab treatment was 17 days earlier. Admission brain magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement showed no abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid showed cell count 20/l, protein 166 mg/dl, glucose 73 mg/dl, and interleukin 6 82.9 pg/ml (normal< 8.7 pg/ml). Atezolizumab-induced encephalitis was diagnosed. His symptoms improved the day after steroid pulse therapy was started. Following steroid pulse therapy, oral prednisolone 30 mg was started and tapered. The cerebrospinal fluid findings normalized on day 14. He was discharged on day 16 without neurological sequelae."
