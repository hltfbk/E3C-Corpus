  "text": "Here we report a 33 year old Caucasian male patient with clinically definite multiple sclerosis who was found to be positive for anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies. Rituximab therapy was initiated. On the 18 months follow-up visit the patient was found to be clinically stable, without typical signs of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis."
