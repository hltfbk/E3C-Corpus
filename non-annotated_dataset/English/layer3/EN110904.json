  "text": "A 28-year-old woman presented with blurred vision in her right eye (RE). She had a history of RP and bilateral hearing impairment since childhood. Fundoscopy and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed a FTMH in the RE along with typical RP features bilaterally. After pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane peel and gas tamponade, the FTMH closed. Six months after PPV the patient underwent cataract surgery in the affected eye, and the visual acuity remained stable compared to baseline. The clinical diagnosis of Usher syndrome was genetically confirmed by whole exome sequencing (WES), which revealed the presence of two pathogenic nucleotide variants in trans (compound heterozygosity) in the gene USH2A."
