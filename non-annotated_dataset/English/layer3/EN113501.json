  "text": "We present a 70-year-old white man who presented with 4 months of progressive inflammatory arthritis with pitting edema. He had been started on nivolumab therapy for his metastatic melanoma with excellent response prior to symptom onset. The symptoms started in his knees and subsequently involved both hands and feet. On evaluation, he was wheelchair bound and completely dependent for all activities of daily living. Evaluation revealed negative serological testing and plain film imaging. Ultrasound demonstrated diffuse flexor tenosynovitis and soft tissue swelling, and a diagnosis of remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema was made. He was treated with orally administered corticosteroids (0.5 mg/kg per day) which improved his symptoms significantly and allowed him to regain prior independent functioning. His corticosteroids were tapered (0.15 mg/kg per day) but not discontinued and his nivolumab treatment was not interrupted. In follow up he continued to have stable control of his melanoma as well as his remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema."
