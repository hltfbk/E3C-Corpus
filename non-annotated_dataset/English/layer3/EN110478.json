  "text": "A 39-year-old woman, para 5, was referred to us for exterior prolapse. She also complained of symptoms of stress urinary incontinence. Physical examination was performed. A stage 4 cystocele, stage 2 utero-vaginal prolapse and stage 3 rectocele were diagnosed. The therapeutic approach was a laparoscopic promontofixation using polypropylene meshes placed anteriorly in the vesicovaginal space and posteriorly to the levator ani. She was well-informed of the necessity to continue her oral contraception for 12 months after surgery.\nShe came to us two weeks post-surgery with a positive beta-HCG. Actually, she had stopped her oral contraception and had an intercourse one week before promontofixation. She decided to continue with the pregnancy.\nThe main target of this research is to focus on pregnancy management before and after promontofixation due to the lack of data on the safety of pregnancy following surgery and the effect of pregnancy on surgical outcome.\nWe performed our bibliographic search on Pubmed and ScienceDirect with the keywords: “Pregnancy & Sacrohysteropexy,” “Pregnancy & Hysteropexy,” “Pregnancy & Uteropexy,” “Pregnancy & Colposacropexy,” “Pregnancy & Sacrohysteropexy,” as well as “Pregnancy & uterine sparing surgery”."
