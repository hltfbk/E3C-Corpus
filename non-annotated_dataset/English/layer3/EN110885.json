  "text": "A 7-year-old boy had severe diarrhea and weight loss progressively at 7 years post-living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for biliary atresia. Endoscopy in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract revealed multiple erosions and ulcer lesions with prominent intraepithelial lymphocytosis in the duodenum and terminal ileum. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated that these accumulated lymphocytes mainly comprised small- to medium-sized T cells expressing CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, and CD103, but lacking CD8, CD56, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs. In addition, T cell receptor β gene rearrangement was detected by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Comprehensively, the lesions were best interpreted as post-transplant indolent T cell lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) of the intestine. Clinical remission was achieved by reducing the immunosuppressant."
