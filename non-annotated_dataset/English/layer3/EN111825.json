  "text": "A 16-year-old girl presented for endocrinology consultation prior to neurosurgical operation. She had galactorrhea which was accompanied by vertigo & low grade blurred vision without a headache and was diagnosed with pituitary macroadenoma and was planned for a surgery. She had TSH level of more than 100 mU/L, free thyroxine of 1.9 pmol/L. Her thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody level was 13.3 IU/mL, insulin growth factor-1 392 µ/l and serum prolactin level 42 ng/ml. During physical exam and with the laboratory findings, we suspected for a primary hypothyroidism as the leading cause of pituitary macroadenoma. As the result, we cancel the surgery and start levothyroxine therapy 100µg daily for her. In the follow-up it revealed that our diagnosis was correct and she went into remission with pituitary gland shrinking and decreasing TSH and prolactin levels."
