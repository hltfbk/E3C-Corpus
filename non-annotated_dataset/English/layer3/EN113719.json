  "text": "The elongated styloid process was resected in a 45-year-old Japanese man using a minimally invasive approach with an intraoperative navigation system. Preoperative preparation involved the use of a custom interocclusal splint to produce the mouth opening conditions required during surgery. Using the three-dimensional position of the navigation probe, the location of the elongated styloid process was identified. After confirmation of the resection spot via the transoral approach, the styloid process was dissected by piezoelectric surgery. Follow-up examination showed an uneventful recovery with no associated complications."
