  "text": "A 53-year-old man who was diagnosed with suprasellar region meningioma received tumor removal via endoscopic endonasal approach. After operation he developed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and intracranial infection. The patient ultimately recovered from infection after anti-infective therapy, but a large fusiform BA aneurysm was still formed and ruptured in a short time. Interventional and surgical measures were impossible due to the complicated shape and location of aneurysm and state of his endangerment, therefore, conservative anti-infective therapy was adopted as the only feasible method. Unfortunately, the aneurysm did not disappear and the patient finally died from repeating subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)."
