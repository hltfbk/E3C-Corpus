  "text": "A 26-year-old man was admitted to our medical center complaining of acute onset painful burning and tingling sensation at the left posterior thigh and calf. He was a bone marrow donor for his brother's bone marrow transplantation. He had underwent a bone marrow harvesting procedure two days before admission as a bone marrow donor, using both posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) as the puncture site. Pelvic magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed enhancement around the left S2 nerve root in T1 and T2-weighted images. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) revealed normal conduction velocity and amplitude on both lower extremities. Electromyography (EMG) presented abnormal spontaneous activity and neurogenic motor unit potentials on the S2-innervated intrinsic foot muscle and gastrocnemius, soleus muscle on the left. The patient was treated with pregabalin for pain control. The patient was followed up after 3, 6, and 12â€‰months. Neuropathic pain improved to Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 1, and recovery state was confirmed by re-innervation patterns of motor unit potentials in electromyography."
