  "text": "A 78-year-old man diagnosed with wet AMD with subretinal fluid and mild cataract received 8 treatments with intravitreal pegaptanib. After AMD remission, he developed a secondary macular hole in the same eye. He underwent a pars plana vitrectomy that successfully closed the macular hole. Intraoperatively, it was found that the patient's vitreous was formed and that the ERM and ILM were adherent, suggesting the involvement of a tractional force at the vitreo-retinal interface due to an inflammatory reaction related to AMD and/or intravitreally injected chemical compounds, resulting in macular hole development. Changes in the condition of his AMD and the RPE were observed on a fluorescein angiogram (FA) and an indocyanine green angiogram (IA) that preceded macular hole development, suggesting that subretinal changes may also have been involved in the pathogenesis."
