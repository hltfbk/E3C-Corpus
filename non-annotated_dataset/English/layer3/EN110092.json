  "text": "A 78-year-old man with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, arterial hypertension, surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis in 2008 and cervical spondylotic myelopathy, presented with a 6-month history of progressive dysphagia, dysphonia and alteration of general state. The patient underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. On examination, he was neurologically intact with no clinical features of cervical spondylosis. Neck computed tomography showed anterior cervical osteophytes displacing the upper airway and compressing the esophagus. A standard anterior cervical approach was undertaken via a transverse skin incision. Going anterior to the carotid sheath, we identified the palpable osteophytes and dissected the longus coli muscle laterally using cutting diathermy. Guided by serial intraoperative fluoroscopy, we drilled away the osteophytes, obtaining a normal contour to the anterior aspect of the C4 to C6 vertebral bodies. The cut bone was then drilled using a diamond burr. The procedure was uncomplicated and he was discharged the following day with rapid resolution of his dysphagia. A check cervical CT scan was performed prior to his discharge. At 8 weeks of follow-up in clinic, he remained well."
