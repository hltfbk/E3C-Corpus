  "text": "A 30-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital after having sustained a fall on her outstretched right arm. She complained of pain, swelling, and restriction of motion of the right elbow joint. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs revealed displaced fractures in the capitellum and the radial head. The patient was operated. Fractures were exposed through a lateral (Kocher) incision. Fracture was reduced, and fixation was performed with 2 AO compression screw. Two fragments of radial head fracture were also reduced and fixed with AO compression screw. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were excellent at the end of a 5-year follow-up."
