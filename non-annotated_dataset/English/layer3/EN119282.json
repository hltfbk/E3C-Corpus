  "text": "A case is presented of a patient suffering from NF1 with clinical signs of malignant change and accumulation of 18FDG in multiple neurofibromas. Histopathological examination of 20 lesions however, did not reveal any malignant features. There was no statistically significant relation between18FDG accumulation and malignant change, but rather with pain, size and growth."
