  "text": "We reported the case of a 56-year-old Chinese woman who presented skin lesions, multiple lung bubblae, recurrent pneumothoraxes, thyroid nodules, and pulmonary inflammatory pseudotumors (PITs). The patient had a family history of pneumothoraxes and renal tumor. The BHD diagnosis was confirmed by genetic testing, which revealed a novel FLCN mutation in exon 14. Furthermore, the patient underwent a bullectomy because of recurrent pneumothorax 6Â years ago."
