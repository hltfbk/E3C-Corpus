  "text": "A 73-years-old male with 5-year history of proteinuria underwent an operation for his sigmoid colon cancer. Seven months later, he was referred to a nephrology division due to an exacerbating renal function and hypoalbuminemia. Laboratory examination revealed positive MPO-ANCA in the serum. A renal biopsy revealed a necrotizing extracapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis with crescents, demonstrating MPO-ANCA-GN. Whereas, immunofluorescent staining documented granular deposition of immumoglobulin (Ig) G and C3 along the capillary wall and electron microscopy showed subepithelial deposits in the glomerular basement membrane demonstrating MN. Immunofluorescent staining of IgG subclass showed positive IgG1, IgG2, negative IgG3 and weak positive IgG4 suggested the possibility of malignancy-associated MN."
