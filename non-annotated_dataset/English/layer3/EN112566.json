  "text": "We report a 67-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation who presented to the hospital with worsening dyspnea and cough. Based on electrocardiogram, venous compression ultrasonography, and computed tomography pulmonary angiography, the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, and acute pulmonary embolism was confirmed. Her coagulation assays and renal function were normal on admission; she was not underweight, did not have a history of hemorrhagic disease, and her CHA2DS2-VAS, HAS-BLED, and simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index scores were 3, 0, and 0, respectively. Oral rivaroxaban (15 mg twice daily) was administered. The following day, she presented gastrointestinal and gum bleeding, combined with coagulation abnormalities. Following cessation of rivaroxaban, her bleeding stopped and tests improved over the next 2 d. Rivaroxaban was begun again 3 d after recovery. However, she again presented with gastrointestinal and gum bleeding and the abnormal tests, and the therapy was discontinued. At 30-d follow-up after discharge, she presented normal coagulation tests without bleeding."
