  "text": "We reported a 72-year-old female patient with two recurrent valgus deformities after TKA for a valgus knee deformity who underwent two revision surgeries to rectify the deformity. In the re-revision surgery, bone defects were successfully reconstructed by the augments and cement in combination with screws and a sleeve. An appropriate neutral alignment of the lower limb was restored by the perfect femoral entry point and the long diaphyseal cementless stem. Adequate fixation of the metaphysis and diaphysis of the femur was obtained by the sleeve and long diaphyseal cementless stem. The patient was pain-free and deformity-free for 2.5 years."
