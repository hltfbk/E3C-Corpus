  "text": "We used the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib to treat a patient presenting a rare p.V600_K601delinsD-mutated melanoma. An objective response was evidenced by two months of progression-free survival. By cloning and sequencing BRAF exon 15, we confirmed that a dual mutation was present on a single allele and thus resulted in a BRAFV(600DK601del) mutant protein. We also performed an in silico crystal structure analysis of the mutated protein, in order to characterize the nature of the putative interaction between vemurafenib and the mutant protein."
