  "text": "A 43 year-old male with chief complaint of lower back pain for 4 years presented to our hospital. Physical exam reveal a firm, non-tender, non-distended, mobile large abdominal mass, which was shown on abdominal CT as a 10 cm retroperitoneal tumor. Biopsy revealed a spindle cell neoplasm in a myxoid background with a delicate vascular network. Tumor resection was performed. Gross examination of the resected specimen showed a 10.8 cm, tan-white, smooth, firm, lobulated mesenteric mass with bulging and gelatinous cut surface and confined within small bowel serosa. Microscopic examination demonstrated foci epithelioid cords and whorls with prominent atypia, in additional of regular, bland-appearing spindle cells in a fibrous and myxoid stroma and osseous metaplasia. The tumor cells stained diffusely positive for DOG1 with moderate staining density, and diffusely and strongly positive for MUC4. Rearrangement involving FUS (16p11.2) gene was identified with break-apart probe and confirmed by Anchored Multiplex PCR. A final diagnosis of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma was rendered."
