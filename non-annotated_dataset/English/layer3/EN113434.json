  "text": "We describe a case of a 28-year-old male who developed a pseudoaneurysm of the radial artery after being operated by plating for a mid-shaft radius fracture. He presented 2 weeks after surgery with swelling over the forearm which was confirmed to be a pseudoaneurysm after computed tomography angiography. It was treated with surgical excision and end-to-end anastomosis."
