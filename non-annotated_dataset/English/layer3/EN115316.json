  "text": "We report a case of iatrogenic inferior thyroid artery pseudoaneurysm during the central line placement due to internal jugular vein puncture. This is a rare complication of central venous cannulation. Fortunately the pseudoaneurysm was monitored closely, diagnosed promptly and obliterated by using radiological intervention. We discuss the risk factors and management of the unintended artery puncture."
