  "text": "A 14-year-old girl was found to have two pulmonary lesions on computed tomography. These tumors had developed 1 year after osteosarcoma surgery. Segmentectomy of right segment 1 and wedge resection of right segment 9 were performed. Both lesions were completely resected and postoperative histopathological examination revealed metastasis of osteosarcoma and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, respectively."
