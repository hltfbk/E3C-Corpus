  "text": "A 78-year-old woman presented with postnasal drip and a cough of 1-month duration. Endoscopic examination of the nasopharynx revealed irregular mucosal thickening of the right lateral and posterior wall of the naso (epi)-pharynx, which was covered with yellow discharge presenting as postnasal drip. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated enhanced soft tissue area in the right lateral and posterior wall of the nasopharynx. Bacteriological examination from a nasopharyngeal swab revealed that staining for acid-fast bacilli was positive and the quenching probe PCR test was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Histopathological examination from the thickening nasopharyngeal mucosa revealed granulomatous formation with caseous necrosis. Ziehl-Nielsen staining directly could detect acid-fast bacilli. Chest X-ray and CT scan ruled out the pulmonary tuberculosis. Base on these findings, we diagnosed it as primary nasopharyngeal tuberculosis. After six months anti-tuberculous therapy, the patient's symptoms had completely disappeared. Nasolaryngoscopic examination and CT image after 6 months post therapy revealed a normal nasopharynx with complete resolution of the lesion."
