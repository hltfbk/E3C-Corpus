  "text": "We present a 53-year old patient who for nine months had been on tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg (0-0-1) therapy for chronic hepatitis B. Three months after the start of antiviral therapy (i.e. for a period of 6 months), the patient observed swelling, itching and hardening of the skin on the face, ears and hands, which subsequently spread throughout the trunk. Subsequent histological study of a skin biopsy revealed changes of scleromyxedema at an advanced stage, though immunoelectrophoresis of serum and urine excluded the presence of paraproteinaemia or para proteinuria. Systemic antihistamine and topical corticosteroid therapy were instituted. Bone involvement with possible plasmacytoma was excluded, and a myelogram showed evidence of an erythroblastic reaction of bone marrow."
