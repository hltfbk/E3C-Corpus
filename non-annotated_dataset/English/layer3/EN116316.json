  "text": "A 37-year-old woman presented with a sudden, painless loss of vision in her left eye. Her visual acuity was 20/200 in the left eye, and 20/20 in the right eye. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed an abnormal tangle of vessels and enlarged draining veins. A fluorescence angiogram revealed fluorescence leakage at a turn near the fovea. Horizontally oriented optical coherence tomography revealed an increased macular thickness and an accumulation of intraretinal fluid, indicating macular oedema. After three intravitreal injections of 1.25 mg bevacizumab, her vision improved to 20/20. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed a decreased calibre of the previously engorged draining veins and ghost vessels. Repeated horizontally oriented optical coherence tomography revealed a decreased macular thickness and the absence of an intraretinal cyst. At the 2-year follow-up visit, the vision of the patient was stable."
