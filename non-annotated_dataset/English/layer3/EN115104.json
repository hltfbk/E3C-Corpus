  "text": "We report a case of a 35 year old Sri Lankan female employed in a Middle - Eastern country who presented with progressive abdominal distention and constitutional symptoms for four months duration. She had been investigated abroad and diagnosed with ascites with chronic portal vein thrombosis following which warfarin therapy had been commenced suspecting an underlying thrombophilia. Despite treatment her symptoms had worsened. Therefore she had decided to return to Sri Lanka for further evaluation. After ruling out inherited thrombophilic states and the antiphospholipid syndrome, further investigations revealed a transudative ascites and high inflammatory markers. The tuberculosis work up on peritoneal fluid was negative. Therefore, we proceeded with laparoscopy which showed multiple nodular deposits on abdominal wall, bowel and omentum and peritoneal biopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation with caseous type necrosis compatible with mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. This was confirmed by tuberculosis genome identification on the biopsy sample confirming a diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis with secondary portal vein thrombosis and cavernous formation due to local inflammation. The patient was started on anti-tuberculosis treatment and warfarin was discontinued, following which she made a remarkable recovery."
