  "text": "We present the case of a 22-year-old Nepalese man who presented with insidious onset of weakness of his right upper limb of more than 5 years duration. His weakness was progressive for the first 3â€‰years, and then remained static. On examination, weakness of the interossei, thenar, hypothenar, flexor, and extensor muscles were present in his right upper limb, power was normal in his left upper and bilateral lower limbs. Minipolymyoclonus was present in both upper limbs, less prominent on the left side. Electrophysiological findings showed motor axonal neuropathy in his right upper limb, neurogenic discharges and fibrillations, and fasciculations in both upper limbs. Contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his cervical spine in flexion was normal. Our patient was diagnosed with HD based on clinical and electrophysiological findings. Our patient was advised to use a cervical collar and regular physiotherapy and was found to have subjective benefit."
