  "text": "Intravenous propofol was prescribed (10 mg every 5 min) for eight patients with intractable migraine headaches visiting the Emergency Department. The average pain score experienced by patients was recorded using the Visual Analogue Scale at the beginning of the treatment procedure and following the injection for 30 min (5-min intervals). The patients' reported pain scores decreased significantly (P = 0.01) from 8.87 ± 0.83 (CI: 8.17, 9.57) to 1.12 ± 0.83 (CI: 0.43, 1.82) before and 30 min following the injection."
