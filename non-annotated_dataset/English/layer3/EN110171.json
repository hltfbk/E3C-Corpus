  "text": "We report the case of a 65 years old Algerian male, without any surgical or medical history, except the antecedent of recurrent paroxystic abdominal pain, and constipation ceding quickly and spontaneously without any treatment, explored by colonoscopy and abdominal CT but no organic pathology was found.\nPatient was admitted this time for abdominal pain, vomiting and permanent constipation evolving since less than 24 hours.\nAt admission time the patient was in good conditions, conscious and cooperating, blood pressure was 100/60 mmhg, physical examination showed an average central abdominal distension with no more abnormality. Biology tests founds, leukocytosis at 12,000 elements/mm 3, blood urea at 0.60 g/l and sodium at 131 meq/l.\nA standard radiography of the abdomen showed many small and central air-fluid levels, with an abnormal projection of an air-fluid level near to the liver area.\nAn abdominal CT scan confirmed the presence of a small bowel loop with its mesenteric vessels projected between the right colon and the liver.\nThe diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction caused by a spontaneous internal hernia was suspected without precision of its type.\nPatient was operated through a midline laparotomy. Operative exploration showed a TOH trough a defect in the right side of the greater omentum measuring 4 cm of diameter strangling a small bowel loop that measured 40 cm, and looked ischemic but returned back to normal coloration after reduction.\nTo prevent recurrences we proceeded to the section of the greater omentum from its free edge to the abnormal defect. No particular event occurred in postoperative period, and patient was discharged on day 3."
