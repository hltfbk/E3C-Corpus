  "text": "A 67-year-old Japanese woman presented with a complaint of skin masses on her left thumb and index finger, which had gradually grown in size over the past few months. A biopsy was performed confirming a diagnosis of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. The aponeurosis on her index finger was resected and tissue was reconstructed using a reverse palmar digital island flap harvested from the base of her index finger. The thumb lesion was also resected and covered with collagen-based artificial skin. Gradual progression of skin epithelialization followed by healing was noted 2â€‰months after the surgery."
