  "text": "A 12-month-old Japanese male was referred to the pediatrics department in our hospital because of developmental retardation. Alexander disease was diagnosed by gene examination of the mutation of a glial fibrillary acidic protein. Magnetic resonance imaging findings showed abnormalities in white matter, deep gray matter, and medulla oblongata. Serial magnetic resonance imaging examinations until the age of five were performed and changes in magnetic resonance imaging findings were compared to the progression in clinical symptoms."
