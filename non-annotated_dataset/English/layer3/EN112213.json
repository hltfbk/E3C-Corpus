  "text": "A 38-year-old man with low back pain and left leg pain for more than 7 years came to our clinic, his symptoms had aggravated for 1 month, and he was diagnosed with L3-4 and L4-5 disc herniations. He received US-guided PELD with good results: His straight leg elevation increased from 40 to 90 degrees after PELD, and his visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index scores both significantly decreased immediately and 6 mo after PELD. With the guidance of US, he received only two shots of fluoroscopy (fluoroscopic time: 4.4 s; radiation dose: 3.98 mGy). To our knowledge, this is the first case of US-guided puncture and cannulation of PELD for LDH at two levels."
