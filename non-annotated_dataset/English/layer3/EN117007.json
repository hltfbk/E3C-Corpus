  "text": "A 45-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital with the chief complaint of blurred vision and facial numbness. The patient had experienced a minor head injury 1 month ago with loss of consciousness. After a 2-week symptom-free period, he developed scalp and facial numbness, along with headache and vision problems. His vital signs were within normal limits, but on examination the patient was noted to have orbital and carotid bruits with several concerning neurological findings. CT and MRI confirmed the suspicion of carotid-cavernous sinus fistula, which was managed by cerebral angiography with coil embolization of this fistula. The patient was symptom free at the 8-month follow-up."
