  "text": "We report a case of a huge retroperitoneal cystic mass in a 46-year-old patient who presented with a long-standing, painless progressive abdominal swelling. On examination, there was a large, non-tender, firm swelling of size around 20 × 15 cm occupying the left upper and lower quadrant. The computed tomography of the abdomen was suggestive of thin-walled hypodense cyst of size 25.7 × 15 × 14.3 cm. Laboratory investigations and cyst aspirate were inconclusive for a definite diagnosis. On exploration, a 3-kg cystic mass was removed. The diagnosis of filarial origin was confirmed by the demonstration of microfilaria in the cyst wall and immunochromatographic test (ICT) which was positive."
