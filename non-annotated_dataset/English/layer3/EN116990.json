  "text": "We herein describe the case of a 19-year-old Japanese woman with a ganglioneuroma. The tumor was found in the parapharyngeal space, an unusual location. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed but was considered inadequate to make a definitive diagnosis, so the asymptomatic lesion was surgically excised using a Weerda laryngoscope. The lesion measured 4 Ã— 3 cm in size and was encapsulated. A pathological analysis showed the presence of two distinct cell types, ganglion cells and Schwann cells, embedded in a loose myxoid stroma. The final diagnosis was a ganglioneuroma."
