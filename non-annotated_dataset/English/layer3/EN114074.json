  "text": "A 12-year-old boy presented with right sided supraclavicular swelling. Plain radiographs revealed a bony mass. Computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging scans of the cervical region showed a bony mass arising from pedicle and encroaching onto lamina of C6 vertebra. He underwent excision biopsy of the mass through an anterior approach. The histopathological diagnosis was osteochondroma. At 4-year follow-up, he was asymptomatic and CT scan revealed no recurrence."
