  "text": "Our patient is a Chinese woman. Two years ago, hundreds of small nodules were identified in her esophagus and intestine. The lesions were characterized by thickened hyalinized collagen fibers and haphazard neoplastic stellate cells. The tumor cells showed generally positive for vimentin and negative for h-CALD, CD34, desmin, CD163, AE1/AE3, CK7 and CK20. The nodules were blue with Masson Trichrome stain. The clinicopathological, immunohistochemical and histochemical features of the tumor were consistent with eruptive collagenoma. The patient was not given specific treatment after diagnosis, and a routine examination indicated that there was no progress for 2 years."
