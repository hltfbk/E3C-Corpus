  "text": "We are reporting the case of a 23-year-old married Saudi female patient, who presented to the King Khalid Hospital and Prince Sultan Centre for Health Services with pain and restricted mobility of the left elbow joint. The patient reported that this restriction in mobility significantly impacted her quality of life, in that she was unable to continue working as a seamstress or perform activities of daily living such as household chores or nursing her infant. Furthermore, she had experienced intermittent mechanical pain at the left elbow joint for the past 7 years, but the frequency and intensity of the pain had intensified ever since she started nursing her child 4 months ago. The character of the pain was reported to be dull, constant in nature and localized to the anterolateral aspect of the elbow joint. It was exaggerated upon movement and relieved upon rest. There was associated stiffness that lasted throughout the day. There was no radiation and no associated neurological symptoms such as numbness or weakness.\nThe patient was not on any long-term medications and had minimal relief of her symptoms with oral paracetamol and topical NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) ointment. Neither positive family history of musculoskeletal deformities nor tobacco or alcohol consumption were performed. A review of her other systems revealed no gross abnormalities.\nOn physical examination, there were no gross abnormalities of the overlying skin or elbow joint when inspected. Upon passive and active movement of the leftelbow joint, significant restriction in supination and pronation were observed. The patient informed that she was cognizant of this restriction since she was young. The neurovascular status of the limb was intact. A plain X-ray was performed for the patient, revealing a diagnosis of congenital radio-ulnar synostosis. The plain X-ray and reconstructed images are delineated in Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively.\nReferencing Figure 1 below, the anterior and lateral views shows fusion of the proximal metaphysis of the left ulnar and radius. There is also a reduction of the radial head, shortening of the forearm and bowing of the radial shaft. The reconstructed images corroborated these findings and the patient was diagnosed with a type 2; visible bony synostosis with a normal and reduced radial head."
