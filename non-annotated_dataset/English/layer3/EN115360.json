  "text": "A 58-year-old man visited the authors' hospital with acute severe epigastralgia. A large amount of free gas and a fluid collection around the stomach were noted on an abdominal computed tomography scan. The results of imaging studies indicated a perforated gastric ulcer, and a distal gastrectomy was performed. There was a large perforation about 50Â mm in diameter in the anterior wall of the middle part of the stomach body. Microscopically, the full thickness of the gastric wall was diffusely infiltrated by a population of large atypical lymphoid cells. The lymphoid nature of these cells was indicated by the strongly positive immunohistochemical staining for CD20 and CD10. This confirmed the diagnosis of a germinal center B-cell-like type of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone were administered after the operation."
