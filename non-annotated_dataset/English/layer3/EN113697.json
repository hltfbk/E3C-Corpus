  "text": "The patient in Case 1 was a 72-year-old female non-smoker who was initially diagnosed with T2aN2M0, stage IIIA adenocarcinoma harboring an EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation. After 8 months of gefitinib therapy, a marked radiologic response was noted, and right upper lobectomy with systemic lymph node dissection was performed. The patient developed brain metastasis despite continuous gefitinib therapy. The patient in Case 2 was a 68-year-old female non-smoker who was initially diagnosed with T3N2M0, stage IIIA adenocarcinoma and an extensive pulmonary thromboembolism. After 3 months of therapy with afatinib and anticoagulants, a marked radiologic response and symptom relief were achieved. We then performed right bilobectomy with systemic lymph node dissection. She developed bone metastasis despite postoperative afatinib therapy."
