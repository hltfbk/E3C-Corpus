  "text": "The patient we described was hospitalised for pronounced cyanosis of the small toe of the right foot, accompanied by painful symptoms at rest and pain symptoms for a few weeks. Using inpatient paraclinical and instrumental tests, the patient was diagnosed with cholesterol microembolism. During the dermatological examination, blue nevus on the contralaterally localised limb was also diagnosed as a sporadic finding. According to the patient's medical history, the finding had existed for many years, but in the last few months, the patient has observed growth and progression in the peripheral zone of the nevus without any additional clinical symptoms."
