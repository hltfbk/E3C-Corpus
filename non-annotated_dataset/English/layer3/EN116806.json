  "text": "A 52-year-old Caucasian woman who presented at our clinic with right flank pain was operated on due to a renal hydatic cyst, and cyst removal was performed. On follow-up, prolonged urinary leakage was observed and a desmopressin treatment was started on the patient. Drainage was greatly reduced after desmopressin was started and there was no drainage on the fifth day."
