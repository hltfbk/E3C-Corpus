  "text": "In our report, we describe the case of a patient with aceruloplasminaemia detected in an early stage (without clinical symptoms of damage to the nervous system) during the search for the cause of hepatopathy with very low values of serum ceruloplasmin. Molecular genetic examination of the CP gene for ceruloplasmin identified a new variant c.1664G > A (p.Gly555Glu) in the homozygous state, which has not been published in the literature or population frequency databases to date. Throughout the 21-month duration of chelatase treatment, the patient, who is 43 years old, continues to be without neurological and psychiatric symptomatology. We observed a decrease in the serum concentration of ferritin without a reduction in iron deposits in the brain on magnetic resonance imaging."
