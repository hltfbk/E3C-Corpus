  "text": "A 4-year-old girl, born to consanguineous parents, was referred to the pediatric clinical immunology outpatient clinic for investigation of recurrent neutropenia with a history of recurrent infections in the past year. On physical examination, she had the characteristic facial features of Cohen syndrome, developmental delay and speech disorder. She had a cheerful disposition, and her mother gave a history of feeding difficulties in her first months of life. She did not present any ophthalmologic or cardiac abnormalities. Her lab results revealed moderate neutropenia. Serum IgG, IgM, IgA and IgE levels were normal. She fulfilled the clinical diagnostic criteria for Cohen syndrome. WES revealed a novel homozygous frameshift variant in VPS13B (LRG_351t1: c.7095del; p.Ser2366AlafsTer49). Currently, she is not experiencing any severe problem, and she undergoes irregular medical treatment once her neutrophil count decreases under the normal limit. Her verbal and motor abilities have improved as a result of speech and occupational therapies."
