  "text": "A 75-year-old man was referred to our hospital with an extrinsic tumor of the lesser curvature of the gastric body. Intraoperative findings showed a tumor located outside of the lesser omentum with no connection between the tumor and the gastric wall. The tumor was subsequently resected. Pathological examination indicated a GIST arising in the lesser omentum measuring 70 mm in its longer dimension. Because the tumor had a PDGFRA mutation (D842V substitution), imatinib was suspected to lack efficacy to the tumor. Thus, although the tumor was considered clinically to have a high risk of recurrence, adjuvant imatinib therapy was not indicated. The patient has been free of recurrence for 29 months since the surgery."
