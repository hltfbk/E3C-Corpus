  "text": "A previously healthy 23-year-old woman presented with fever and hemiplegia. She was subsequently intubated after scoring 7 out of 15 at the Glasgow Coma Scale. Brain computed tomography scans of the patient depicted a massive sylvian infarction while an abdominal computed tomography scan revealed multiple enlarged abdominal lymph nodes and a retroperitoneal mass adjacent to the left psoas muscle. A diagnostic work up for inherited thrombophilia yielded negative results. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures for infectious agents also gave negative results. A biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass guided by computed tomography was inconclusive. A biopsy of an enlarged inguinal lymph node of the patient, combined with an immunophenotypic analysis, revealed an unspecified variant of peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy but developed multiple organ failure. She died 26 days after she was admitted to our intensive care unit."
