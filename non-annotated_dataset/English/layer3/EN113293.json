  "text": "An 18-years-old healthy male was admitted in Sylhet M.A.G Osmani Medical College Hospital with history of attempted suicide by Paraquat ingestion. On admission, he had high serum creatinine but otherwise asymptomatic. He was discharged on day 10 when his renal functions returned to normal. But On day 15, he started having respiratory symptoms-unresponsive to any of the local treatments he received, and by day 30, he developed overt lung fibrosis. We present sequential blood picture, radiographs and CT scans demonstrating Paraquat induced kidney and lung injury over the course of 30Â days."
