  "text": "We present a rare case of a female patient with partial peripheral resistance to thyroid hormones due to a point mutation coding for the beta subunit of the integrin molecule α(V)β(3) and concomitant Hashimoto`s thyroiditis. Clinically, the patient`s symptoms were in favour of hypothyroidism, and the laboratory results were in favour of the secondary hyperthyroid state. PCR protein amplification detected a point mutation coding for the membrane receptor, which mediates a signal via the MAPK pathway when bonded with thyroid hormones."
