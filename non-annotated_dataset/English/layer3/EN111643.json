  "text": "The patient was a 56-year-old woman with a 2-year history of neck pain. No obvious abnormalities were detected on neurological or physical examination, and laboratory findings were all within normal limits. An imaging examination suggested a C7 vertebral bone tumor. The patient refused to continue conservative observation treatment and requested surgery. Open VP of the C7 vertebral body was carried out, and her postoperative neck pain was completely relieved. The postoperative pathological results supported the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia, and the patient was ultimately diagnosed with MFD. At the 12-month follow-up visit, the patient reported no clinical symptoms, and no signs of tumor recurrence were detected."
