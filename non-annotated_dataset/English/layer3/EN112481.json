  "text": "The present case was a female the fifth born in a litter of 5 puppies. At about 2-3 weeks of age, she suffered from abdominal distension, pain, and constipation. At approximately 8-10 weeks of age, the puppy started to vomit abundantly, and the regurgitated food appeared undigested. Progressive abdominal distention was observed, with quite visible peristaltic movements and more frequent vomiting episodes. The abdominal radiographs, based on AP and side projections, revealed an enlargement of the abdominal diameter and an increased width in the epigastric region. At 12 weeks of age, exploratory surgery revealed a stenotic segment in the jejunum, followed by a small transition zone and then a significantly reduced diameter. Immunohistochemical examinations were performed using antibodies against calretinin, S-100 protein, CD56, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and synaptophysin, which are the biological markers for diagnosing HSCR."
