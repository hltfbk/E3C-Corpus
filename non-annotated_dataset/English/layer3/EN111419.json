  "text": "In this case, a 50-year-old woman with transient blindness and headache was admitted to the hospital. The patient was diagnosed with VSS. A stent was placed at the stenosis. The stent released the intravenous pressure and remitted the patient's symptoms. Measurements of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) were performed at 3 time points: before stenting, after stenting, and 3â€‰months later. The dCA gradually improved after stenting."
