  "text": "A 51 year old patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and extensive hidradenitis suppurativa of the perineum underwent a temporary defunctioning loop sigmoid colostomy and subsequent perineal skin excision and skin grafting. The ostomy was complicated by a parastomal hernia and stoma prolapse 6 weeks post operatively. Five months later he developed spontaneous rupture of parastomal hernia and evisceration of small bowel. Urgent surgery was done and reduction of small bowel loops and re-siting of the sigmoid colostomy was done."
