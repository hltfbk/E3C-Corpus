  "text": "In this report, we report a case of PMP originating from an ovarian teratoma in a LS patient. The patient had surgical treatment of PMP arising from an ovarian teratoma at the age of 38Â years, and later developed a transverse colon cancer at the age of 40. The patient's family history fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria, and genetic analysis of the peripheral leukocytes identified a germ line mutation in the MLH1 gene (MLH1 c.1546dupC p.Q516PfsX3). Interestingly, immunohistochemical staining showed that the expression of MLH1 was lost in the colon cancer as well as the ovarian teratoma. Consistent with the loss of MLH1 expression, both tumours showed high microsatellite instability (MSI-H)."
