  "text": "We herein discuss a case of a 38-year-old man initially diagnosed with a gastric cancer brain metastasis. At first, only stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was performed, but it was not effective. After the brain and systemic metastases progressed, SRS and anti-PD-1 therapy were administered in combination, and the brain and intra-abdominal metastatic lesions responded satisfactorily."
