  "text": "A 25-year-old man complained of severe pain on his right hand after a fall when he suffered a direct traumatism over ulnar-dorsal side of the hand. Physical examination showed localised tenderness and moderate swelling over the fifth metacarpal and along the ulnar side of the hand. The little finger presented a marked deformity with mild abduction and external rotation. There was a palpable prominence in the volar hypothenar region. Subjectively, sensation was intact in the median and ulnar nerve distributions.Also, vascular exploration of the hand was normal. Standard plain radiographs revealed a palmar and radial dislocation of the fifth carpometacarpal joint without other lesions or fractures on the others digits or the wrist. Immediately, under local anaesthesia, we performed a closed reduction by longitudinal traction and direct pressure over volar base of the metacarpal. The reduction was stable and was confirmed by X-rays control. After the wrist and the metacarpophalangeal joint of the little finger were immobilized in a cast for 6weeks. After this period of immobilization, the patient had been working with physical therapy and using his hand for daily activities. Six months following injury the patient had full range of movement of the little finger and normal grip strength, the radiographs showed the reduction to be maintained."
