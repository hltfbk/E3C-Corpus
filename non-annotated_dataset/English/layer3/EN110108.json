  "text": "A 52-year-old, otherwise healthy women was referred to orthopedic clinic with a 3-months history of anterior right elbow pain. She complained of a painful swelling in the right antecubital fossa. There is no history of trauma nor any medical illnesses. On examination there is hard tender soft tissue mass in the right antecubital fossa. MRI was done and it demonstrate lobulated mass noted adjacent to biceps tendon insertion at radial head measuring 4 x 2 x 2 cm (CC x transverse x AP diameter respectively) post contrast images shows thick peripheral enhancement and internal enhancing septa. Brachial artery and superficial radial nerve located anteromedial and superficial radial artery located lateral to the lesion. Elbow is intact with no joint effusion and visualized bone structures are unremarkable. Surgical exploration, removal of the lesion and histological investigation provided definite diagnosis and treatment. The bursa was wrapped around the distal biceps tendon with clear margins between both structures. Histological investigations confirmed the diagnosis of an inflamed bicipitoradial bursa."
