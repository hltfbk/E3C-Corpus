  "text": "A 55-year-old male patient complained pain in his bilateral hip, with no history of trauma, glucocorticoid hormone consumption or radiotherapy, and imaging examination revealed fracture nonunion and shortening in his left femoral neck, and double fracture line on the right femoral neck. The patient received a cementless THA for the left femoral neck fracture and conservative treatment for the right side, followed by Elcatonin injection and oral administration of Carbonate D3 Granules. After 4â€‰months of fellow-up, the patient presented improved functional scorings in bilateral hip joints, with no signs of prothesis infection or loosening."
