  "text": "The case of a 71-year-old woman who underwent simultaneous total knee arthroplasty and ankle arthrodesis for severe neurosyphilitic Charcot arthropathy (Eichenholtz classification stage III) and was evaluated three years after surgery is reported. Deformities of the left knee joint and ankle developed. The left leg was shorter by 20â€‰mm, with a functional leg length discrepancy. The patient was limping, and marked varus instability of the left ankle was observed during the stance phase of walking. Postoperatively, the patient was able to walk without assistance, confirming improvement of mobility."
