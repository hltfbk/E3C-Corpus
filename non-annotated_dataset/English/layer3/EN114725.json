  "text": "We describe the case of a patient with congenital GBM who developed eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi (EDSN) after chemotherapy. Few cases of EDSN have been described in literature and this rare clinical variant, which occurs predominantly in adults, is characterized by multiple Spitz nevi in the trunk, buttocks, elbows and knees. There is no satisfactory treatment for EDSN and the best therapeutic choice is considered the clinical observation of melanocytic lesions."
