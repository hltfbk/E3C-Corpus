  "text": "A 40-year-old male patient with diagnosed Ig G lambda multiple myeloma was referred to the spinal unit based at the RNOH. An L5 fracture was deemed to be the cause of significant lower back pain. He underwent an L5BKP with good immediate results and in the absence of any immediate complications. Post-operative, the patient had normal distal neurology and was discharged1day postoperatively. 3 days after surgery, he underwent left hamstrings anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. 2 days following the latter, he developed significant pain in his left groin and thigh associated with numbness. A pelvicmagnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed a left iliopsoas hematoma. This case was treated conservatively under guidance of the multidisciplinary team."
