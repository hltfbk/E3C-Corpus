  "text": "We report a 24-year-old Chinese female with RDP who exhibited a strikingly asymmetric, predominantly dystonic movement disorder with a rostrocaudal gradient of involvement and parkinsonism. Physical examiniations revealed hyperactive reflexes, bilateral ankle clonus and positive Babinski sign in the right. DTI showed reduced white matter integrity of the corticospinal tract in the frontal lobe and subpontine plane. Genetic testing revealed a missense mutation of the ATP1A3-gene (E277K) in the patient."
