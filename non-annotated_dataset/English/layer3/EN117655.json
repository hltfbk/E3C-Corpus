  "text": "Two patients, a 24-year-old Irish Caucasian man and a 64-year-old Irish Caucasian woman, developed symptoms attributable to anorectal stenosis four to six weeks after treatment. A further patient, a 25-year-old Irish Caucasian male, presented three years after treatment with anorectal stenosis, having been asymptomatic with his stenosis for the preceding three years. No patients had evidence of active inflammation at time of representation or had previous anal canal surgery."
