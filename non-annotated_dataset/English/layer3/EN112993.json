  "text": "We report the case of a woman diagnosed with multifocal bilateral renal cell carcinoma that underwent bilateral radical nephrectomy and was started on a regular hemodialysis program at the age of 29. While on hemodialysis program she was diagnosed clinically with BHD syndrome and molecular testing confirmed an heterozygous mutation on FLCN gene. The patient has been kept on surveillance program for 2 years with no clinical complications from the genetic syndrome and in complete remission from renal cancer. Though there has not been any report of a patient with BHD being transplanted, risks and benefits for this patient were weighted. She has been considered apt by the transplant team and is currently waitlisted for cadaveric renal transplantation."
