  "text": "A 40-year-old Caucasian man with severe rheumatoid arthritis being treated with high-dose adalimumab presented to our facility with a swollen leg and palpable left groin and left axillary lumps and a left nipple lesion. Left lower limb ultrasound, computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans showed extensive lymphadenopathy. Core biopsies of the left groin, axilla and nipple lesion showed this to be concurrent diffuse B-cell lymphoma and locally metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. He underwent a left mastectomy with axillary clearance, and adjuvant fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy with rituximab, and the adalimumab was stopped."
