  "text": "A two-month old infant was seen in our paediatric emergency department due to paracetamol poisoning after repeated supratherapeutic doses. She was treated with intravenous n-acetylcysteine diluted with dextrose 5%, according to the 20-hour standard protocol. Eight hours later she developed two tonic-clonic seizures and was subsequently intubated. By that time, she had received almost 1 liter of 5% dextrose, and serum sodium was 114 mg/dL. A rapid correction was done with hypertonic saline and the child experienced a good outcome, without any sequelae."
