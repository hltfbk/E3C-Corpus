  "text": "A 55-year-old man had major functional impotence of the wrist and right hand with an extremely evolved SNAC III wrist with completely intramedullary bone resorption of the capitate. On the basis of this diagnosis and due to refractory severe pain that did not respond to conservative treatment, we discussed 3 therapeutic options: PRC with resurfacing capitate pyrocarbon implant (RCPI) in case of a possible large bone graft intraoperatively, a pyrocarbon intermediate prosthesis like adaptative proximal scaphoid implant which is interposed between the radius and the second carpal row, or a complete arthrodesis of the wrist. He was successfully managed by capitate pyrocarbon prosthesis associated with capitate bone graft. The patient presented no pain and was satisfied with the operation. The X-ray showed a stable prosthesis."
