  "text": "A 77-year-old man who had developed bilateral peripheral edema, persistent proteinuria, and nephrotic syndrome was admitted to our hospital. He was diagnosed with MN based on a renal biopsy 3â€‰years after resection of rectal cancer, and positive staining for THSD7A in both kidney and rectal cancer tissues suggested that these two diseases were related. Furthermore, THSD7A staining of metastatic lymph nodes revealed deposition of THSD7A in the secondary lymph follicles and sinus. Recurrence of rectal cancer was suspected; however, tumor recurrence was not observed on chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) and colonoscopy. There was no lymph node enlargement. The patient was kept on observation with supportive therapy. Consequently, although nephrotic syndrome persisted, obvious recurrence and metastasis of the primary tumor were not observed."
