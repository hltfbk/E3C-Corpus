  "text": "Case 1 was a 62-year-old woman with macular edema caused by central retinal vein occlusion in her right eye, and Case 2 was a 65-year-old man with macular edema caused by branch retinal vein occlusion in his right eye. In view of the patients' condition and economic constraints, an intravitreal injection of TA was administered. Due to inappropriate manipulation during surgery, the lens was injured. The site of lens injury and clinical manifestations were different in the two cases. Symptomatic treatment and continuous follow-up were carried out. The therapeutic effect following phacoemulsification of the cataract was satisfactory."
