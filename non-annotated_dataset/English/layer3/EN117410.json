  "text": "A 22-year-old African American woman presented with a headache of two weeks duration, visual blurring and horizontal diplopia after starting ciprofloxacin for pyelonephritis. An ophthalmic examination revealed that she had left eye esotropia, and a picture of the fundus demonstrated bilateral disc swelling without spontaneous venous pulsations. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a magnetic resonance venogram were normal. A diagnostic lumbar puncture demonstrated an elevated opening pressure of 380mmH2O in a supine position. Laboratory examinations, including a cerebrospinal fluid exam, were unremarkable."
