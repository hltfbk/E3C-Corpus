  "text": "We report our experience of using central ECMO therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome followed by seizure in a 15-month-old girl with a severe epileptic disorder. Her respiratory distress was refractory to standard medical treatment and mechanical ventilatory support. Her condition was complicated by development of a pneumothorax. The patient was successfully weaned off ECMO and discharged without deterioration of her neurological status."
