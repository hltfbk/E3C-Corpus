  "text": "A 29-year-old man was diagnosed with CAPV with splenomegaly and gastroesophageal varix when being treated for pancytopenia and liver dysfunction. A living donor liver transplantation was performed for him using the right lobe which had been donated by his mother. The PV was reconstructed using his own great saphenous vein (GSV) as a graft vein. The end of the GSV graft was anastomosed to the inferior mesenteric vein while the other end was anastomosed to the vein graft of the right hepatic vein from the explanted liver."
