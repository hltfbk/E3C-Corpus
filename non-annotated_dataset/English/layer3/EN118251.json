  "text": "A 92-year-old female presented to our clinic with multiple eruptive seborrheic keratoses, which had dramatically increased in size and number over the past two years. A diagnostic work-up revealed an ovarian carcinoma. Hence, cutaneous findings in our patient were consistent with the diagnosis of the Leser-Trélat sign."
