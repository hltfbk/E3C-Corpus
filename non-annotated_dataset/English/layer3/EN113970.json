  "text": "A 50-year-old man presented at our emergency department with recurrent resting chest pain. Following unsuccessful attempts at visualizing the left coronary artery using Judkins left and Amplatz catheters, an aortogram using a pigtail catheter suggested anomalous left coronary artery origin and showed a significant occlusive lesion at proximal left anterior descending artery. A Judkins right 4 guiding catheter was placed around the left coronary ostium and exchanged for a Judkins left 3.5 guiding catheter after introducing a .014\" coronary long wire into the left circumflex artery. With excellent angiographic visualization and guide support, a drug-eluting stent was then successfully implanted. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) demonstrated left coronary artery origin from right coronary cusp."
