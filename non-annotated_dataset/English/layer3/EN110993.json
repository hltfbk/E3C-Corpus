  "text": "We reported the case of a young man presenting with frequent episodes of pneumothorax and intrapulmonary cavities and nodular lesions without arterial or visceral complications. His skin was thin and transparent, and the joints were slightly hypermobile. Whole-exome sequencing (chip capture high-throughput sequencing) revealed a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 41 of the COL3A1 gene (NM_000090.3: c.2977G > A), confirming the diagnosis of vEDS. vEDS remains a very rare and difficult diagnosis to determine."
