  "text": "A 73-year-old male who was in his usual status of good health, presented with intractable vomiting and nausea for two days. He had epigastric pain, increasing abdominal girth of about 4 months duration and 7 kg weight loss over two months. There was no jaundice, change in stool color, diarrhea, or flushing. On examination there was mild diffuse abdominal tenderness in all quadrants, as well as a palpable mass on left upper quadrant. All blood tests were normal, including tumor markers. Ultrasonography was carried out and revealed a 10cm X 8 cm solid-cystic mass in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen. CT scan showed a well-marginated, encapsulated, heterogeneous, hypovascular mass, at the tail of the pancreas, with a thickened, peripherally enhancing capsule. This mass had mixed cystic and solid components. At laparotomy, there were no metastasis, and no severe adhesion or invasion of the pancreatic mass to the adjacent organs and near-by vessels was grossly noted. A distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy were performed. On macroscopic examination, the tumor was round, fluctuant and measured 10,5x 8x 6,5 cm. It was encapsulated and well-demarcated from the surrounding pancreas. The cut section revealed light brown solid areas with zones of hemorrhage and necrosis at the periphery of the tumor and cystic degeneration centrally. Microscopically, the growth pattern was heterogeneous with a combination of solid, pseudo-papillary and haemorrhagic-necrotic and pseudocystic structures. Solid areas were composed of poorly monomorphic, eosinophilic and clear cells admixed with hyalinized to myxoid stromal bands. Neoplasic cells delicately infiltrated the fibrous capsule, separating the tumor from the normal pancreas. Vascular invasion was rare. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells expressed strongly vimentin, CD10, CD56 and progesterone receptors. There was no expression of antibodies to cytokeratin and neuroendocrin markers (chromogranin and synaptophysin). Four reactive regional lymph nodes were examinated. Spleen specimens were unremarkable. Resection margins were free. These findings were compatible with solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas. The patient was subsequently discharged after one week. A CT scan performed 16 months postoperatively showed no evidence of disease recurrence."
