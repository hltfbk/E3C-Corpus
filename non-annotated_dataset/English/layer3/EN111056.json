  "text": "Here we reported a case of a 53-year-old man with these three entities present with chest and back ache and attempted a novel approach, thoracic endovascular aortic repair, in the absence of surgical treatment. The patient lived over 5â€‰years and this case provides initial experience and lesson about the endovascular and medical management of the uncommon and dangerous disease- type A aortic intramural hematoma with aortic congenital malformation."
