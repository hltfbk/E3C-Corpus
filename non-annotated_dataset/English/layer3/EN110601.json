  "text": "A 40-year-old female was diagnosed with Campanacci Type 3 GCT-DER 7-year back. The patient was operated and treated by excision of tumor and reconstruction with contralateral fibular grafting with K-wire fixation of DER7-year back and biopsy of growth was sent. After 7 years, the patient again developed swelling over the right wrist and radiological diagnosis of GCT Campanacci Grade 3 is made. She is managed by resection of tumor tissue by volar approach to DER with proximal row carpectomy with ulnocarpal fusion with retrograde K-wire fixation of the 3rd metacarpal resulting in centralization of ulna."
