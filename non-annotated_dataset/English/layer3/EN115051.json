  "text": "On a cold morning, a 71-year-old male of Han nationality with a complaint of sudden onset left-sided weakness and difficulty in speaking was brought to the emergency department. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a high-intensity area in the right basal ganglia and corona radiata. Laboratory test showed the presence of high titers of cold agglutinins. There was no history of common risk factors of atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease or smoking. After being exposed to warm temperature, and with corticosteroid therapy and blood transfusion, the patient's symptoms relieved rapidly."
