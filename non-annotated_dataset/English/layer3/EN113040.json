  "text": "We describe an 11-month-old Palestinian baby boy with hepatosplenomegaly, hypotonia, delayed motor development, laryngomalacia, bilateral cherry-red spots, and failure to thrive. Metabolic screening, blood count, differential tests, immunology screen, infectious disease screen, urine, biochemical tests as well as molecular diagnosis were performed. The molecular diagnosis was done by amplifying the whole sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene, followed by deep sequencing. The obtained sequences were aligned, de novo assembled and compared to human reference gene (GenBank GeneID: NG_011780.1, Ensembl version ENSG00000166311 and protein identified as UniProtKB - P17405). Two known mutations were identified in our patient: the pathogenic frameshift mutation NM_000543.4(SMPD1):c.573delT (p.Ser192Alafs) and the benign polymorphism NM_000543.4(SMPD1):c.107T>C (p.Val36Ala). The enzyme study showed a very low level of enzymatic activity of acidic sphingomyelinase (0.1 nmol/ml per hour). Correlations between clinical findings, laboratory data, and sequence analysis are presented."
