  "text": "A 68-year-old man was admitted with right abdominal pain and bloody stool that had been present for 2 weeks prior to admission. His medical history included abdominoperineal rectal resection with permanent sigmoid stoma (Miles operation). Colonoscopy showed a sub-occlusive tumor in the transverse colon but provided no information about the proximal colon. Thus, computed tomographic colonography (CTC) was planned to assist our examination of the proximal colon under sigmoid colostomy. CTC revealed the apple core sign in the hepatic flexure, without any evident tumor in the proximal colon. Therefore, we performed transverse colectomy and lymph node dissection, preserving a part of the ascending colon and Bauhin valve."
