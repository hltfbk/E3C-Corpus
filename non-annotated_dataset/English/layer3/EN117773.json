  "text": "We present the case of a 37-year-old patient with laparoscopically resected pheochromocytoma. He was investigated for hypertension, flushing and ectopic heart beat. Abdominal CT and MRI revealed a mass measuring 8 x 4 cm in the right adrenal gland. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed by elevated 24-hour urine levels of VMA, metanephrines and catecholamines as well as positive MIBG scan. The patient presented with classic clinical features of NF-1, which was confirmed by pathologic evaluation of an excised skin nodule. The patient underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy through a transabdominal approach and was discharged on the second postoperative day, being normotensive. The patient is normotensive without antihypertensive therapy 11 years after the procedure."
