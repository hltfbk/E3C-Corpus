  "text": "A 12-year-old girl was admitted to the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes for evaluation of brachydactyly and a right fibula fracture. Clinical examination revealed sparse scalp hair, a characteristic bulbous pear-shaped nose, and brachydactyly with significant shortening of the fourth metatarsal. Neither intellectual disability nor multiple exostoses were observed. Radiography of both hands showed brachydactyly and cone-shaped epiphyses of the middle phalanges of the digits of both hands with deviation of the phalangeal axis. Genetic analysis of TRPS1 identified a heterozygous germline sequence variant (p.Ala932Thr) in exon 6 in the girl and her father. Approximately 1 month before being admitted to our department, the girl experienced a minor fall and suffered a fracture of the proximal fibula in the right lower limb. The pathological cytological diagnosis of the osteolytic lesion was NOF. Ten months following the surgery, the lesion on the proximal fibula of the girl disappeared."
