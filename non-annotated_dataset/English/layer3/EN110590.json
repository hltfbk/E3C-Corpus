  "text": "An 11-year-old skeletally immature girl presented to us two 2 years back with pain and swelling over the right forearm without any restriction of moments and other constitutional symptoms. She was diagnosed to have non-ossifying fibroma and had underwent surgery for the same 4years back. Radiographic and higher imaging studies suggested non-ossifying fibroma. Since the lesion was painful and the child had difficulty in carrying heavy objects, we decided to intervene. Tumour tissue was thoroughly curetted and the defect was filled with artificial bone substitute. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of non-ossifying fibroma and post-operative radiograph showed some residual tumour which was noted even at one 1-year follow-up X-ray. On 3-years follow-up,the patient was symptom-free with no residual lesion and complete incorporation of the artificial bone substitute."
