  "text": "The patient underwent a single stage procedure to treat the aortic root, valve and coarctation with a composite valved conduit and extra-anatomic bypass of the coarctation. The modified Cabrol technique was necessary to attach the coronary buttons due to grossly abnormal anatomy. The patient made a remarkable recovery and was discharged on the 8th post-operative day."
