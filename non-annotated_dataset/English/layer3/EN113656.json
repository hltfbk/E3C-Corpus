  "text": "We report the first case of HSS with aortic aneurysm in a 55-year-old man who initially presented with deep venous thrombosis. The diagnosis of HSS revealing Beh√ßet's disease was made given the history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers. Treatment consisted of 3 daily pulses of methylprednisolone (1g) followed by oral prednisone (1mg/kg daily) and 6 monthly pulses of cyclophosphamide. Oral anticoagulation treatment was held 3 months and then was stopped with good outcome."
