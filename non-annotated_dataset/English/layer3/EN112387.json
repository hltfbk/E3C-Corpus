  "text": "A 53-year-old woman who was diagnosed with vitiligo in September 2017 was treated with Qubaibabuqi tablets. After approximately 7 months of treatment, the patient developed a severe, diffuse yellow staining of the skin and sclera in March 2018. On admission, she was diagnosed with acute cholestatic hepatitis associated with Fructus Psoraleae. Despite receiving active treatment, her condition rapidly deteriorated and she died 5 days later due to acute liver failure and multiple organ dysfunction. To the best of our knowledge, there are only six reported cases of liver injury associated with Fructus Psoraleae described in the English language literature; however, cases of acute liver failure associated with the use of Fructus Psoraleae have not been described."
