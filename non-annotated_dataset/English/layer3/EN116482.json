  "text": "Crystal violet dye was instilled into the bladder of a 47-year-old Japanese woman to confirm the presence of a vesicovaginal fistula. Our patient developed symptoms of gross hematuria, frequent urination and lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed thickening of her whole bladder wall with spotted high-density lesions. Cystoscopy demonstrated desquamated epithelial cells and a hemorrhagic bladder wall. We treated our patient conservatively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and glucocorticoids. During follow-up, magnetic resonance images showed that the detrusor muscle of her bladder was normal. Our patient's symptoms gradually improved and she completely recovered within six months."
