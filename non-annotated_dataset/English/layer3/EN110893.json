  "text": "This case report covers an anterior open bite of a 25-year-old man successfully treated with the posterior maxillary segmental osteotomy (PMSO) and miniplates. After the pre-surgical orthodontic treatment, the PMSO between canines and first premolars was performed under local anesthesia and miniplates were placed on the zygomatic buttress. As a result of 28 months of treatment, an impaction amount of 3.5 mm was obtained in the maxillary posterior teeth, and the facial esthetics improved at rest and smile."
