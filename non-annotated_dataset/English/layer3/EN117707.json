  "text": "We report the case of a 27-year-old Asian man presenting with bilateral subtrochanteric femur fractures. He had a displaced right subtrochanteric femur fracture after a low-energy fall, which was treated surgically. The second fracture that our patient endured was diagnosed as a stress fracture ten weeks later when he complained of pain in the contralateral left thigh. By that time, the right-sided fracture exhibited no radiographic evidence of healing, and when the left-sided stress fracture was being treated surgically, bone grafting with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-7 was also performed on the right side."
