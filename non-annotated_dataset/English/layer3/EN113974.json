  "text": "We present data from a patient, in whom the concept of a novel controlled automated reperfusion of the whole body (CARL) was applied after 120Â min of CPR under normothermic conditions. The patient survived without cerebral deficits and showed full recovery of all organs after prolonged cardiac arrest (CA) except for the spinal cord, where a defect at the level of the 11th thoracic vertebra caused partial loss of motoric function of the legs."
