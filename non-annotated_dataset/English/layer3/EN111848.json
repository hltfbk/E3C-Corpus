  "text": "A 27-year-old male, having sustained a left, Gustilo IIIB tibial shaft fracture following a motor vehicle accident, underwent a reamed intramedullary nail fixation performed through a suprapatellar approach. Two months later, he presented with intra-articular heterotopic ossification which was limiting his knee movement. He then underwent arthroscopic removal of the bony fragments which resolved his symptoms."
