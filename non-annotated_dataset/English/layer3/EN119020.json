  "text": "We describe a case of intrauterine retention of fetal bone diagnosed 8 years after the termination of a pregnancy. The patient had no complaints of pain, irregular vaginal bleeding or discharge. A hysteroscopy was performed and irregular structures were removed. These fragments were fetal bones, which probably functioned as an intrauterine contraceptive device. After removal of the fetal bone fragments the patient conceived spontaneously within 6 months."
