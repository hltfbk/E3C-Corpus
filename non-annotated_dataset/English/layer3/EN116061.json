  "text": "We report a case of a 29 year old Latin woman diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma, who was initially given a total thyroidectomy, central and bilateral neck lymph node removal followed by a radioiodine therapy. Subsequent evaluation indicated locoregional progressive disease and metastatic involvement in both lungs. Following this, the patient was prescribed 200 mg of sorafenib administered every 12 hours, but after four days, she presented with a skin reaction compatible with hand-foot syndrome. After discontinuation of the therapy, this reaction ceased."
