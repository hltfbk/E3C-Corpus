  "text": "We report a case of a 40-year-old female who underwent bilateral total hip arthroplasty surgery due to bilateral developmental hip dysplasia. Trochanteric osteotomy was needed in her right hip to advance trochanter major distally. Trochanteric fixation was achieved by a cerclage cable system. Four years after the surgery, the patient referred to the hospital with a prominence and pain in her right inguinal area. Radiographies revealed medial migration of a broken trochanteric cable part. The possible route of the cable was through medial adductor muscles, posterior to the femoral neurovascular bundle and anterior to the sciatic nerve. Both migrated and remaining parts of the cable were extracted under general anesthesia."
