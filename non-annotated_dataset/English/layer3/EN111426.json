  "text": "A 52-year-old male presented with massive traumatic avulsion of the penile and scrotal skin following mishandling of an electric drill. The avulsed skin was missing. The patient was diagnosed with massive skin avulsion of external genitalia. Following initial complete debridement of devitalized or infected tissues, Pelnac dermal substitute was secured to the defect with the assistance of negative-pressure wound closure. In the final step, the silicone layer of Pelnac was removed and a split-thickness skin graft was applied. The defect had healed at the two-month follow-up. The patient now has normal erections and satisfactory sexual function."
