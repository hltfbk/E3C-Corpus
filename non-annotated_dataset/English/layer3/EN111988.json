  "text": "We report the case of a 39-year-old woman, who had undergone resection of a retroperitoneal paraganglioma at her local hospital for 12 years. She was referred to our hospital for further evaluation of a hepatic mass, which was misdignosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and was treated by transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the local hospital 6 years ago. At admission, CT scan revealed a huge hypervascular mass with many feeding arteries, almost the same size as 5 years ago. Ultrasound-guided biopsy of the liver tumor was performed and immunohistochemical examination confirmed the diagnosis of hepatic metastatic paraganglioma. Though liver metastasis failed to achieve complete response or partial response to TACE treatment, it remained stable without progression during the 7-year follow-up."
