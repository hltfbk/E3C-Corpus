  "text": "A 51-year-old man was involved in a motor vehicular accident and his left eye was struck by the deployed airbag, resulting in a para-central scotoma. The patient underwent a full ophthalmologic examination, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and imaging with prototype AO-SLO systems (Canon Inc.) at 14 and 22 months after the injury. Images focused on the photoreceptor layer were recorded in the foveal area, and a montage of AO-SLO images was created. On AO-SLO, focal dark areas could be observed in the left eye at 14 months after the injury. The analysis showed that the cone mosaic (cone density, 16503/mm(2); ratio of hexagonal Voronoi domain, 36.3 %; average nearest-neighbor distance (NND)/expected NND, 0.606) was disordered compared with the normal area of the same eye (cone density, 24821/mm(2); ratio of hexagonal Voronoi domain, 44.1 %; average NND/expected NND, 0.739). The cone defect area corresponded to the area of the scotoma. A second AO-SLO was performed on the patient at 22 months after the injury and although there were still areas with reduced cone reflectivity, partial improvement of cone mosaic was detected by AO-SLO at this time point."
