  "text": "A 56-year-old man who has been treated hypertension and diabetes mellitus was detected low plasma potassium level with an elevated level of plasma aldosterone concentration and bilateral adrenal swelling. Endocrinological examinations showed autonomous secretion of cortisol and aldosterone, with suppression of plasma ACTH level and renin activity. A selective adrenal venous sampling demonstrated that left adrenal gland was responsible for aldosterone hypersecretion. He was diagnosed preclinical Cushing's syndrome due to ACTH - independent bilateral adrenocortical macronodular hyperplasia (AIMAH) associated with aldosterone producing adenoma of the left adrenal gland.Â A laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed."
