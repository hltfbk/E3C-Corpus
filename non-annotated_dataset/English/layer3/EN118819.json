  "text": "A 63-year-old Caucasian woman presented with hemodynamic effective macrohematuria (hemoglobin 70 g/liter) 4 days after ureterorenoscopy and biopsy of the upper pole collecting system due to recurrent microhematuria. Duplex-sonography and computed tomography angiography revealed multiple arteriovenous fistulas and erosions into the calyceal system. Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography confirmed this condition. After superselective embolization of the arteriovenous fistulas, the patient had no further episodes of bleeding or microhematuria."
