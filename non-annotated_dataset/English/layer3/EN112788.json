  "text": "We present a 30-year-old male patient with FD of the left femur, chronic osteomyelitis, recurrent periprosthetic hip joint infection after multiple revision arthroplasties, and two episodes of axillary vein thrombosis. Due to the severe structural changes and a large medial wall defect in the proximal femur with impairment of a large soft tissue zone, it was decided during operation not to put any other implants in the hip joint and perform only a resection hip arthroplasty procedure."
