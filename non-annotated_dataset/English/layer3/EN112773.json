  "text": "A 58-year-old male with no particular background who, after falling from a 5 m height, presented a fracture and dislocation of both of his shoulders and showed no pulse in his right arm due to an injury to his axillary artery. The peculiarity of this injury increases when the axillary artery injury is added to the bilateral fracture and luxation of the humerus. We present the case and revise literature."
