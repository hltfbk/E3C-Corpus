  "text": "A 59-year-old male patient presented with a thyroid left lobe soft mass detected by chest computed tomography scans prior to the surgical treatment of RCC of the left kidney. The thyroid mass was initially considered to be benign, then he underwent left radical nephrectomy. One year after the nephrectomy, stereotactic radiosurgery was performed for brain metastasis. During follow-up, the thyroid nodule gradually grew, and the patient manifested swallowing discomfort. Under a clinical diagnosis of thyroid follicular neoplasm, left hemithyroidectomy was performed. Although hemithyroidectomy is usually a safe and straightforward procedure, massive bleeding from markedly developed tumor vessels made the operation very difficult. The thyroid tumor was finally diagnosed as metastasis from clear cell RCC."
