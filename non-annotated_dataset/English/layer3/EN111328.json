  "text": "A 50-year-old woman presented because of chest distress after activity, with worsening symptoms. After examination, the final diagnosis was uterine angioleiomyoma. The tumour originated in the uterus; grew into the right iliac vein; coursed along the iliac vein, inferior vena cava, and right atrium; and finally invaded the right ventricle. To best complete the surgery, a multidisciplinary surgery was selected. Before the surgery, a three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction model was created to assess the tumour status, and this model enabled the surgery to be completed successfully."
