  "text": "A 69-year-old woman prescribed cilostazol was hospitalized for acute kidney injury. On admission, her renal function deteriorated, with an increased serum creatinine level. Urinalysis showed hematuria, proteinuria, and hyper-beta2-microglobulinuria. A renal biopsy revealed diffuse tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with IgA nephropathy, and gallium-67 scintigraphy showed uptake in the bilateral kidneys. A drug lymphocyte stimulation test for cilostazol was positive, and the patient was diagnosed with cilostazol-induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Despite discontinuation of cilostazol, her renal function rapidly worsened and steroid pulse therapy was initiated, followed by oral high-dose glucocorticoid therapy. After steroid treatment, her serum creatinine level normalized in parallel with urine beta2-microglobulin."
