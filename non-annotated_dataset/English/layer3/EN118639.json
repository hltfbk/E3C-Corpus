  "text": "Given this was his first time with priapism, an extensive work-up revealed the patient had previously undiagnosed sickle cell trait, which we postulate to have been a significant factor in his development of acute priapism. Sickle cell trait is considered to be a generally benign condition except for a few rare complications under more demanding physical conditions. However, upon reviewing the literature on the association of sickle cell trait with priapism, we believe this may not be the case. Case reports and small series that appeared in the 1960s and 1970s indicated an association between priapism and sickle trait. Little has been reported recently, and the general teaching regarding sickle cell trait does not include this information. However, one case was reported with the use of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and the development of priapism in a patient with sickle cell trait. These medications are now first line treatment in erectile dysfunction. They act by enhancing nitric oxide (NO) production leading to relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpora cavernosa and penile arteries."
