  "text": "This case report describes a 35-year-old African man who presented with a large mandibular tumor with an orocutaneous fistula that was found to be an ameloblastoma on histopathological examination, with concurrent squamous cell carcinoma histology within the fistula. This presentation was consistent with a Marjolin's ulcer within an ameloblastoma."
