  "text": "We describe a case of a 26-year-old Thai woman with a chronic intraorbital foreign body located within her medial intraconal space. The chronic intraorbital foreign body was successfully removed by endoscopic transnasal surgery, combined with assistance from a navigation system, 8 months after injury without any damage to her eye or disturbance in vision."
