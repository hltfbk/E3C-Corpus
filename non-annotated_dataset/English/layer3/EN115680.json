  "text": "A 73-year-old Caucasian man was referred to undergo urologic surgery due to a painless nodule in the right testis and an homolateral inguinal lymphoadenomegaly. The patient had a history of medullary thyroid carcinoma with relapsing disease to the spine and lung nodules. Serum calcitonin and CEA levels were 175 pg/ml and 22 ng/ml, respectively. With suspected testicular cancer, the patient underwent radical right orchiectomy with the excision biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry revealed that both the lesions were due to metastases from medullary thyroid carcinoma."
