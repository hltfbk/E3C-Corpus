  "text": "We reported a sporadic case of a 32-year-old Han Chinese male diagnosed with TSC, whose spouse had a history of two spontaneous miscarriages and an induced abortion of a 30-week fetus identified with cardiac rhabdomyoma by ultrasound. A novel heterozygous missense variant in the TSC2 gene (Exon35:c.4511 T > C:p.L1504P) was identified in the male patient and the aborted fetus by next-generation sequencing, but not in his wife or both his parents. According to the ACMG/AMP criteria, this variant was classified as a \"likely pathogenic\" variant."
