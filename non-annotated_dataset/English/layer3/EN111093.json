  "text": "A 55-year-old woman presented at our hospital with intermittent epigastric pain. She had a slightly high level of serum carbohydrate antigen 72-4 (CA 72-4). Endoscopic ultrasound found that a cystic mass originated from the submucosa of the posterior gastric wall near the cardia, indicating a diagnosis of cystic hygroma of the stomach. Furthermore, a computed tomography scan demonstrated a quasi-circular cystic mass closely related to the lesser curvature of the gastric fundus with a low density. Because the imaging examinations did not suggest a malignancy and the patient required complete resection, she underwent laparoscopic surgery. As an intraoperative finding, this cystic lesion was located in the posterior wall of the fundus and contained some yellow viscous liquid. Finally, the pathologists verified that the cyst in the fundus was a gastric BC. The patient recovered well with normal CA 72-4 levels, and her course was uneventful at 10 mo."
