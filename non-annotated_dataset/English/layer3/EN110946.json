  "text": "A middle-age man with EoE since 2004, had a total esophageal bolus obstruction while eating lunch at the local hospital. Drinking water, in an attempt to release it, led to a total intramural ruptur of the esophageal wall. A CT scan detected the injury and a covered esophageal stent was inserted within 2 h from the injury. Despite the immediate hospital care, he developed mediastinitis, were in need of a laparascopy and intensive care. After 8 weeks the stent was removed and the esophagus was considered healed. Biopsies from the esophagus showed an eosinophilic inflammation (65 eosinophils/HPF). Twelve weeks from the injury he was essentially back in his normal state and was discharged from the hospital. He was placed on a 6 weeks course of topical treatment with budesonide, which needed to be extended due to inadequate remission. Remission was achieved after 12 weeks of treatment."
