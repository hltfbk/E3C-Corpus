  "text": "We present a case of a Chinese patient with bone-metastatic scrotal Paget's disease harboring triple uncommon HER2 mutations (R678Q/S310Y/S310F). Due to poor conditions (severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, ECOG PS3), this patient could not tolerate traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Then, the patient participated in a registered clinical trial (NCT03239015) about basket trial for intractable cancer. The patient received pyrotinib (400 mg po qd) and achieved a partial response for 4.0 months."
