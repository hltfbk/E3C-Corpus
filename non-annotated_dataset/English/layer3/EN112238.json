  "text": "We report the case of a 71-year-old Japanese man who developed clinical symptoms of myositis, such as muscle aches and weakness, after initiation of nivolumab therapy for his gastric cancer. He was initially diagnosed with nivolumab-induced myositis, because the myositis symptoms appeared after nivolumab administration, and nivolumab is known to trigger various drug-associated autoimmune diseases. However, according to his characteristic skin lesions, the type of muscle weakness, his serum marker profiles, electromyography of his deltoid muscle, and magnetic resonance imaging, he was finally diagnosed as having paraneoplastic dermatomyositis. Accordingly, treatment with intravenously administered corticosteroid pulse treatment, immunoglobulin injection, and tacrolimus was applied; his symptoms subsequently improved. However, to our regret, at day 142 after administration, he died due to rapid worsening of his gastric cancer."
