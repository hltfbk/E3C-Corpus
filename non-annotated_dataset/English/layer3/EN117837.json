  "text": "A 46-year-old Caucasian female was referred for anterior chest wall and back pain. Physical examination was unremarkable except for skin lesions noted on soles of both feet, extremities and the face. A thoracic magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated a lesion characterized with bone marrow edema and proliferation of soft tissue in the sternum. A brain MRI was requested secondary to the elevated prolactin level which was compatible with empty sella syndrome."
