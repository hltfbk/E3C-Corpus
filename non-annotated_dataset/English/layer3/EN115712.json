  "text": "A 25-year-old male presented to us with right hip pin of insidious onset and progressive course. The patient had limited range of motion of the right hip. Initial plain radiographs were negative, and diagnosis of osteoid osteoma was highly suspected by magnetic resonance imaging and multi-slice computer tomography (CT) showing nidus close to fovea. Arthroscopic resection of the lesion was done, and the patient had dramatic pain relief during follow-up."
