  "text": "We present a case of primary mediastinal CCS in a 57-year-old man. Computer tomography (CT) revealed a 12 × 12 × 7.5 cm mass in the anterior mediastinum. Microscopically, the tumour mainly consisted of epithelioid cells with oval vesicular nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, the tumour was positive for human melanoma black 45 (HMB-45) and vimentin but negative for S-100 and Melan-A. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) showed a translocation involving the EWSR1 gene region."
