  "text": "A 50-year-old patient, on hemodialysis for end-stage renal failure, fell on his right side. He presented with sudden right knee and elbow pain, with functional impairment of both joints. X-rays showed avulsion-like osseous lesions on the olecranon and patella with a low-riding patella. Ultrasound confirmed complete quadriceps and triceps avulsion ruptures. Both lesions were treated surgically. Fixation was performed with anchors using the Krackow suture technique for both tendons. Postoperative clinical and radiological results were satisfactory, and follow-up was uneventful. The patient regained his preinjury functional level with a complete range of motion of both his knee and elbow."
