  "text": "A 32 year-old woman with a history of non-diabetic hemodialysis for 3 years suffered from severe involuntary movement, and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed symmetrical T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2FLAIR) hyperintense nonhemorrhagic lesions in the bilateral basal ganglia. She was diagnosed with UE as syndrome of bilateral basal ganglia lesions, due to a combined effect of uremic toxins and hyperthyroidism. After treatment with high frequency and high flux dialysis, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and declining parathyroid hormone, the patient achieved complete remission with normal body movement and was discharged."
