  "text": "This report describes a case of pseudo aneurysm of superior lateral geniculate artery that developed after primary Total knee arthroplasty for a stiff knee in a 68Â year old patient. Patient presented with pain and rapidly increasing swelling in early post operative period. Diagnosis was made on duplex ultrasound and confirmed by angiography. Angiographic coil embolisation of the pseudoaneurysm was performed. Since no lateral release was performed in this case, the probable mechanism was shear injury to the vessel."
