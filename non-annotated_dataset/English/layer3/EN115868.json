  "text": "The authors report a case of chondroblastoma involving the diaphyseal area of radius in a seven year old female child. She presented with pain and swelling around the left distal third forearm for eight months. Wide excision of tumor was performed and the defect was bridged with avascular fibular auto graft, secured to host bone with k-wires and dynamic compression plate to achieve osteosynthesis."
