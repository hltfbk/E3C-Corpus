  "text": "Here, we report a 32-year-old man who presented with diarrhea and lower abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a generalized abdominal tenderness, more prominent in the lower abdomen, including the right and left quadrants. Abdominal ultrasound failed to show any findings supportive of the diagnosis of appendicitis. Further investigation with abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) with intravenous and oral contrast revealed retrocecal appendicitis. The patient was discharged home after a non-complicated appendectomy."
