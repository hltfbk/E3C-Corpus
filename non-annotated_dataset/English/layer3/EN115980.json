  "text": "We report the case of a 63-year-old woman with a bulky and metastatic MRCL, treated with trabectedin 1.5 mg/m(2) as a first-line treatment. She experienced a long-lasting clinical benefit. The patients received 14 cycles of trabectedin and achieved a durable partial response to the metastases and a stable disease of the primary tumor, which is a very favorable safety profile. Also noteworthy is that we have observed a calcification of the primary tumor and the metastasis. The response, which lasted 30 months, led to a symptomatic improvement, associated with an excellent general condition and an absence of pain."
