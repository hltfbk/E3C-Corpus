  "text": "A 35 year old grand multiparous woman who was 1 week into puerperium was admitted with severe difficulty in breathing at rest, chest congestion and pain. She also had easy fatigability, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, edema, tachycardia, tachypnea, irregularly irregular heart rate with a pulse deficit, elevated jugular venous pressure, cardiomegaly, hepatomegaly and pulmonary crepitations. On the sixth day while improving on standard drugs for heart failure, she developed bizarre behavior and confusion. She also had auditory, visual and olfactory hallucinations; violence to the baby and the husband; and refusal to feed and take medication. There was no altered sensorium and the vital signs were normal. She was diagnosed with puerperal psychosis during the management of peripartum cardiomyopathy."
