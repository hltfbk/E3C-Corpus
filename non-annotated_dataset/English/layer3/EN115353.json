  "text": "A 53-year-old South Asian man with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus was referred to our medical unit in an advanced stage of the disease, which was complicated by sepsis and acute kidney injury. Failure of the referring unit to provide prompt treatment, as well as their delay in coming to a diagnosis, led to the patient's complicated state. Antibiotic therapy was initiated, and clinical stabilization was achieved with supportive measures. Following the patient's recovery from sepsis, his persistent leukopenia and anemia was suggestive of an underlying immunodeficiency, and a subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed acute myeloid leukemia, M2 variant. Multi-disciplinary care was initiated by the medical, surgical and oncological teams."
