  "text": "A 28 year old man presented with a 3-month history of an asymptomatic scrotal swelling. Ultrasonography and computer topography revealed an intra-scrotal and extra-testicular mass without local invasion. Surgical excision was undertaken and histology was an ancient schwannoma of the scrotum."
