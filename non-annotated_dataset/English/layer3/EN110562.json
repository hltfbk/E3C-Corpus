  "text": "We report the case of a 54-year-old patient, a farmer living in a rural area, type 2 diabetic on insulin who presented 3 years ago an inflammatory vesicular lesion of the left foot, progressing gradually. The patient consulted a general practitioner 3 months after the onset of the first symptoms, who concluded with contact eczema and put the patient on dermocorticoids. The evolution of the pathology was made by the appearance of fistulas on the dorsal side of the foot. The patient again consulted with a general practitioner who after a disturbed glycemic assessment concluded with a diabetic foot, prescribed a diagram of glycemic balance and antibiotic treatment and care for the foot of the patient. After further treatment failure the treatment was referred to an endocrinologist for diabetic foot. After glycemic control, a dermatological opinion was requested by the endocrinologist in front of the atypical aspect of the foot. New exams were prescribed, including a biopsy with pathology study and an x-ray of the foot. The pathology study revealed the presence of Madurella mycetomi. Given the severity of the bone damage, the patient was referred to the orthopedic surgery team for treatment. The decision for a trans-tibial amputation has been made; given the patient's refusal, twice-daily care was offered to him; unfortunately, the patient was lost to follow-up in particular because of the COVID-19 crisis."
