  "text": "We found depressed patients in a transvestite, 21-year-old male, a Malay tribe with complaints of loss of self-confidence, lack of cheerfulness, lack of enthusiasm, easily tired and unable to sleep. Feeling family and community cannot accept their conditions. Mockery, ridicule and satire by citizens must be received every day by patients and families because the patient is a transvestite."
