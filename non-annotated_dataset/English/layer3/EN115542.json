  "text": "A 64-year old male presented with a 13-month history of gradual vision loss in the right eye to the extent that he could only perceive hand movements. His intraocular pressure (IOP) measured 50Â mmHg and he was found to have advanced primary open angle glaucoma. Medical treatment was commenced and he underwent a successful right Mitomycin C-augmented trabeculectomy. Unexpectedly he experienced marked improvement in vision post-operatively, with improvements maintained through six months of follow-up. At his most recent visit visual acuity was 6/18 in the affected eye. Although the mechanism of improved vision cannot be proven it is likely that successful lowering of IOP resulted in some reversal of retinal ganglion cell dysfunction. Important factors may have included his relatively young age, high IOP and short duration of symptoms."
