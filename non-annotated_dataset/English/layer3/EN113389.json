  "text": "An 82-year-old female patient who had intermittent waist pain without any other symptoms, had diagnosed as urothelial cancer on computerised tomography urography. Considering the patient's age and quality of life, we made a preserving kidneys resection of the local tumour. The tumour was composed of sarcomatous and carcinomatous elements, and immunohistochemical examination showed that tumour cells were positive for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, and GATA3 markers. There were no complications after 1-hour surgery. After 3Â months, there was no signs of recurrence and metastasis."
