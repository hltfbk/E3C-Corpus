  "text": "We report four cases of POWV infection in Minnesota and North Dakota with known exposure to tick bites in 2011. Our first case was an 18-year-old male who dramatically presented with seizure and headache with positive serum analysis for Powassan virus immunoglobulin M. The second case was a 60 year old gentleman with intraparenchymal hemorrhage and was diagnosed via cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Thirdly, a 61 year old male developed altered mental status and encephalitis. Our fourth patient was a 69 year old male who had headache and non-focal weakness who was diagnosed with serum analysis."
