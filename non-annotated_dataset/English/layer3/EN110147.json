  "text": "Case 1: a 64-year-old man fell from a step-ladder, injuring the right little finger. On physical examination, the finger was found to be deformed, and an X-ray demonstrated a dorsal dislocation of both the PIP and DIP joints. Manual reduction was easily achieved with gentle longitudinal traction; however, the X-ray after reduction revealed an avulsion fracture of the volar proximal rim of the middle phalanx. A dorsal splint was applied for three weeks and then rehabilitation was started. At the final review there was no joint instability, whereas the PIP flexion was 90 degrees and the extension deficit was 10. The range of motion had a slight limitation; however, the patient had no complaint of pain or functional deficit. Case 2: a 66-year-old man fell from a step-ladder and injured his right little finger. The X-ray revealed dorsal dislocation of both PIP and DIP joints. Gentle longitudinal traction was successful, but the X-ray showed a volar rim fracture. A splint was applied for one week. Since the patient did not complain of pain or joint instability a week after the injury, buddy taping was applied instead of the splint and nearly full range motion was achieved at the final review."
