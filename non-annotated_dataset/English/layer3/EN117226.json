  "text": "We present a case of a 70-year-old Japanese man with multiple hepatocellular carcinomas in whom the replaced left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery needed to be embolized. After several failed procedures, the replaced left hepatic artery was successfully catheterized and embolized with a microcatheter and microcoils via the right gastric artery through the anastomosis."
