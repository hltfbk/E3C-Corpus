  "text": "A 64-year-old man who plastered without any dust protection for more than 40â€‰years was referred to our hospital with suspected interstitial pneumonia. Mixed dust pneumoconiosis and an unusual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern with fibroblastic foci were diagnosed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, and an elemental analysis detected elements included in plaster work materials. Despite the cessation of plaster work and administration of nintedanib, the patient developed advanced respiratory failure."
