  "text": "A 20-year-old Chinese woman presented to the Hematology Department complaining of fatigue and knee pain. Blood test showed anemia and thrombocytopenia. On the second day of hospitalization, she was transferred to the ICU due to dyspnea and hypotension. Autoimmune profiles showed hypocomplementemia and positive antinuclear antibodies. Computer tomography showed an enlarged heart and pneumonia. Ultrasound revealed an enlarged heart with a low left ventricular ejection fraction. Fulminant lupus myocarditis with cardiogenic shock was initially considered. Due to the accompanying pneumonia, aggressive immunosuppression was contraindicated. Her cardiac function remained critical after the initial therapy of intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids at a conventional dose, but she responded well to later PE therapy plus corticosteroids administration. The patient fully recovered with normal cardiac function."
