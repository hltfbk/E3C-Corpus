  "text": "Case 1 was a 65-year-old Caucasian woman who fell forward with initial contact to her left knee, sustaining an impacted femoral neck fracture of her ipsilateral left hip. Case 2 was a 92-year-old Caucasian woman who fell bending forward, impacting her left knee and sustaining a comminuted intertrochanteric fracture of her ipsilateral left hip. The fractures occurred as a result of unprotected ground level falls in a forward direction with initial impact to the knee. The knee contusions were located near Gerdy's tubercle and appear characteristic of a direct impact injury."
