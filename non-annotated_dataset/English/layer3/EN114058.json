  "text": "We here describe a case of a 35-year-old patient who presented with a history of exertion dyspnoea and coughing for the past 20 years. At the age of 15, she was exposed to smoke emanating from a fire. Later, she had exposure to mold for two years, and during her childhood, she had animals such as a cockatiel, dog, cat, gecko, and turtle. Computed tomography of the chest revealed symmetrical apical giant bullous lesions. Histology of the resected bullae showed prominent peribronchial fibrosis with non-necrotizing, non-caseating granulomas and collaps of pulmonary lobules adjacent to the bulla. The absence of granulomatous infection and a markedly elevated CD4:CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage analysis suggested that the underlying process was sarcoidosis."
