  "text": "A 55-year-old man presented with locally advanced anaplastic thyroid carcinoma that was observed to have mediastinal infiltration. Tracheal stenosis due to infiltration of the trachea occurred, and the condition of the patient rapidly deteriorated. Radiation and chemotherapy consisting of cetuximab, cisplatin, and fluorouracil were ineffective, but his tracheal stenosis was relieved 2 weeks after initiation of lenvatinib, after which the patient could be discharged. However, the lenvatinib was ineffective for his liver, bone, and brain metastatic lesions, and the patient remained in a critical condition."
