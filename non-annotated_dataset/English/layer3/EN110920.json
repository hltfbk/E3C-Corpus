  "text": "An 87-year-old woman exhibited gait disturbance due to delayed leg paralysis secondary to non-union of an osteoporotic fracture of the T12 vertebral body. Artificial bone grafting was performed with 7.5 g of the Î²-tricalcium phosphate granules impregnated with 12 mL of bone marrow blood collected from normal vertebral bodies, where pedicle screws would be inserted. Three months after surgery, the cortex of the anterior vertebral wall was regenerated, and bone union was completed. For up to 1 year after surgery, absorption of the artificial bone and formation of new bone had been observed."
