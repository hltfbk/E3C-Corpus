  "text": "An 84-year-old man was admitted to our hospital having signs and symptoms suggestive of prostatic disease for 3 years. Histological and immunocytochemical studies of trans-urethral biopsy of the prostate showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Radiological assessment of disease confirmed the diagnosis of early stage lymphoma of the prostate. The patient was managed by 6 of rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 1, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 on day 1, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 on day 1, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 on day 1, and prednisone 50 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5 with complete clinical and radiological response. He remained disease free, until now, 30 months after the end of chemotherapy."
