  "text": "We report a case of a previously healthy 12-year-old Caucasian girl who was examined on emergency owing to an asymptomatic gross haematuria. An active urinary sediment and nephrotic-range proteinuria were identified, and serologic examination showed a decreased serum C3 concentration not associated with any immunologic or infectious cause. Oedema, hypertension, and renal insufficiency were not observed. A renal biopsy was performed, and crescentic glomerulonephritis associated with C3 glomerulonephritis was diagnosed. Prompt treatment with intravenous steroids resulted in complete resolution of the gross haematuria. Further examination did not detect any underlying acquired cause. A combination of oral steroids and cyclophosphamide, followed by mycophenolate mofetil, was maintained and resulted in clinical remission during an 8-month follow-up."
