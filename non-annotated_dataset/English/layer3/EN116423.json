  "text": "We identified a male patient with progressive external ophthalmoplegia who also developed a progressive bradykinesia, rigidity and camptocormia in the third decade. Parkinsonism was partially responsive to dopaminegic replacement. His father and brother had reportedly similar clinical problems. Genetic analysis identified a novel mutation p.K512M in the POLG1 gene."
