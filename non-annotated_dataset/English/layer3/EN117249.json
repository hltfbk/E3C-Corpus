  "text": "The patient had first presented at the age of 20 years with a solitary lesion of the humerus which spontaneously regressed. At that time, no therapy or smoking cessation was indicated. Four years later she presented with bilateral pneumothorax and pulmonary lesions of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. She had pleurodesis for this disease-related complication, and no further systemic treatment was applied, except with regard to smoking cessation. During the follow-up period, her pulmonary lesions regressed without recurrence six years after the initial lung involvement."
