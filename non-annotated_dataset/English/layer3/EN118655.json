  "text": "We report on a 75-year-old white patient with progressive difficulty in swallowing and dysphagia, resulting in weight loss over the last two years. Radiological evaluation, (x-rays and Magnetic resonance imaging), confirmed the diagnosis of DISH, and revealed marked compression of the esophagus at the C5-6 level, due to excessive ossification of the anterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine.The patient was treated with anterior cervical approach for removal of the hyperostosis without fusion. He had marked improvement in swallowing function and was able to resume a normal diet after one month."
