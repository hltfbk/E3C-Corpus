  "text": "We present the case of a 22-year-old Caucasian woman with a unilateral ovarian fibroma, falx cerebri calcification and odontogenic keratocysts, but without any skin manifestations. The diagnosis of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome was made after a right salpingo-oophorectomy for a calcified ovarian fibroma with cystic degeneration. Pathologic examination of the 10â€‰cm right ovarian mass revealed a well-circumscribed spindle cell lesion. Immunohistochemical staining of the lesion demonstrated positivity for vimentin and smooth muscle actin."
