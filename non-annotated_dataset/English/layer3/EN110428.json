  "text": "A 40-year-old woman presented to our hospital emergency department three months after she underwent a total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and bilateral salpingectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding unresponsive to medical treatment. During this initial surgery performed in another hospital, two endometriotic nodules of the uterosacral ligaments had also been resected. The vaginal cuff had been incised using monopolar electrocautery and closed vaginally using 0-Monocryl ® (Ethicon Inc. Somerville, NJ) interrupted sutures laparoscopically. Histological examination revealed adenomyotic uterus and confirmed the endometriotic origin of the nodules. The postoperative follow-up at one month was unremarkable with a properly healed vagina. The patient was consulted three months after her operation with a complaint of acute pelvic pain that was followed by nausea and vomiting. Before the onset of symptoms, the patient had sexual intercourse for the first time since her surgery. The husband revealed that during sexual intercourse, he suddenly did not have the same sensation of perception of the vaginal bottom. Physical examination showed a tense abdomen, particularly in the right lower quadrant with an overall score of pain estimated by the patient at 9/10. Speculum examination exposed small bowel free from necrosis protruding through the vaginal wall with the presence of peritoneal fluid. Conversely, no vaginal bleeding or foul-smelling discharge was observed. The bowel was kept moist and warm with gauze. Preoperative laboratory workup was performed and showed a hemoglobin level of 13.9 and a platelet count of 271 with leukocytosis 11.9, a standard C reactive protein, urinalysis, and culture. These results were obtained postoperatively. After informed consent was acquired, the patient was taken to the operating theatre for urgent exploratory laparoscopy and underwent an inspection of the entire bowel, which was free of necrosis and adhesions to surrounding structures. Reduction of bowel evisceration into the abdomen and peritoneal wash via laparoscopy were followed by closure of a 5cm vaginal wall dehiscence by transvaginal route, after having resected the scarred and devitalized vaginal tissue at the margins to refresh it. To do this, an interrupted suture using an absorbable 0-Vicryl ® (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ) was performed. The patient was discharged on a postoperative day 2 with an uncomplicated hospital course. Histological analysis of the resected vaginal tissue revealed no particular lesions other than inflammatory granuloma lacking specificity and malignancy. At her 4-months follow up, a well-healed vaginal cuff was palpated, the vagina had good caliber and length and sexual activity was resumed without complications."
