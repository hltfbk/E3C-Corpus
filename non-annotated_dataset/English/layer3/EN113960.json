  "text": "A 50-years-old Asian woman presented with a conjunctival cyst in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed a 5 mm × 2 mm sized freely movable conjunctival cyst. After a 1 mm × 1 mm sized conjunctival opening was made using PASCAL photocoagulation, the cyst was extracted using a non-toothed forceps without rupture. Two weeks later, complete re-epithelialization of the conjunctiva was observed without any complications. No evidence of recurrence was noted over the 6-month follow-up period."
