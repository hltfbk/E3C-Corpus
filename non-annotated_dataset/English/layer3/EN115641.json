  "text": "A baby was born by emergency caesarean section due to foetal distress and meconium stained liquor, to a 27-year old primi-gravidae, Sinhalese female, who was febrile during and 2 days prior to labour. The baby had evidence of respiratory distress due to meconium aspiration and was cared for in the special care baby unit for 3 days. On the 4th day he developed fever and serial blood counts showed a gradual rise in the haematocrit (>20% of baseline value) and lowering of platelet counts. The baby was treated for sepsis and as Sri Lanka was experiencing a massive dengue epidemic was also tested for dengue. His dengue NS1 antigen test was strongly positive and the dengue IgM antibodies weakly positive on day 3 of illness. The mother was positive for both dengue IgM and IgG antibodies."
