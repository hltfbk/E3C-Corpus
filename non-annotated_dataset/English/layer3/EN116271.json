  "text": "A 73-year-old man was transported by ambulance to a community hospital with chief complaints of high fever and a gait disorder. Computed tomography screening revealed a hypervascular tumor (size, 9 Ã— 8.5 cm) in the lower pole of the left kidney. Upon admission to our hospital, his general condition was poor and his performance status was judged as 3, based on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status criteria. After biopsy for the renal tumor, he received 5 mg of axitinib twice daily for 3 months. No serious adverse events were reported during this treatment. The tumor diameter shrank by 56%. Left radical nephrectomy was performed, and there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Pathological examination indicated a pT3aN0M0, Furman grade 3, clear cell renal cell carcinoma with necrosis, hyaline degeneration, and hemosiderosis. The patient was asymptomatic and disease-free at 1 year post-diagnosis."
