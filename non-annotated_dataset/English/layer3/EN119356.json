  "text": "A 55-year-old lady was admitted under the general surgeons, with 3-day history of abdominal pain, three-week history of loss of appetite and weight. The patient was sequentially investigated with ultrasonography, computerised tomography and finally selective angiogram in a multidisciplinary setting. The selective angiogram showed a GIST with intratumour bleed, leading to successful surgical excision and being recurrence free at 22 month follow up."
