  "text": "We highlight the case of a 73-year-old Vietnam War Veteran with active tobacco dependence who achieved complete response with nivolumab for metastatic NSCLC after four prior lines of chemotherapy. Nivolumab was discontinued after 10 cycles due to immune-mediated hepatitis that resolved with steroids. He remained in complete remission for 14 months while off therapy. Then, his tumor recurred twice locally in the mediastinum and he again achieved complete and durable responses after each recurrence with radiotherapy. Due to recurrence in both lungs one year later, he was rechallenged with nivolumab and achieved partial response after two months of therapy. He continues to do well five and a half years since his initial diagnosis of de novo metastatic NSCLC."
