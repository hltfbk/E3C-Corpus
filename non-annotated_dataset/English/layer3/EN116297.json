  "text": "A 15-year-old Caucasian boy presented to our institution with recurrent respiratory infections, severe atopic dermatitis, short stature and skeletal malformations. Laboratory tests showed a high level of immunoglobulin E, hypereosinophilia with a normal white blood cell count and a low level of somatomedin C. The patient had had atopic dermatitis resistant to treatment since the age of 6Â months. His height did not increase despite receiving cyclic therapy with recombinant growth hormone."
