  "text": "A 71-year-old man consulted for a clinically suspected prostate hypertrophy with a serum Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level within the reference range of 2.7ng/ml (normal: 0-4ng/mL). Transrectal ultrasound guided needle prostatic biopsy concluded to Gleason 6 (3+3) prostatic adenocarcinoma. Prostatic MRI showed a low signal intensity mass in peripheral zone. Diffusion weighted image showed a high signal intensity mass in peripheral zone without extracapsular extension. Bone scan and Chest, Abdomen and pelvis CT-scan didn't show metastasis. A radical prostatectomy was performed and pathological examination concluded to a Gleason 6 ADK (3 + 3) classified pT2aN0M0. HT using LHRH analogue (Triptorelin) and antiandrogen agent (bicalutamide) were started, and serum PSA level gradually decreased to a nadir of 0.04ng/ml. The patient had a biological recurrence (PSA at 0.52) after 2 years with a doubling time greater than 12 months. He had a salvage RT (66Gy) and the PSA level didn't exceed 0.08ng/ml over a period of 4 years.\nNine years after treatment, patient complained of hematuria with a rise in PSA level between 0.33 and 0.59ng/ml over a period of three years. A cystoscopy objectified a peri-cervical mass of 2 cm whose resection concluded to a vesical localization of a prostatic ADK.\nHT (Triptorelin and Cyproterone acetate) was done. Six months later, hematuria recurred and cystoscopy objectified a bladder recurrence. Histopathological examination concluded to a bladder squamous cell carcinoma. The patient refused total cystectomy. He had Gemcitabin and Cisplatinum chemotherapy (CT) combined with Triptorelin with partial response after three cycles of CT and good tolerance. The patient is still under treatment."
