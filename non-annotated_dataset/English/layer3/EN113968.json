  "text": "We are reporting a case of a 62-year-old, postmenopausal women with primary fallopian tube carcinoma of the right fallopian tube in stage IA. The patient has lower abdominal pain, watery vaginal discharge and repeated episodes of bleeding from the vagina. The clinical and radiological findings suggested a right adnexal tumour with elevated CA-125 levels. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy and peritoneal washing were performed. Pathologic confirmation of primary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the right fallopian tube was made. Peritoneal washings were negative for malignancy. FIGO stage was considered as IA, and the patient received no courses of chemotherapy and postoperative radiation because she refused it. Ten months after initial surgery, the patient is alive and in good condition."
