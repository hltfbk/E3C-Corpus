  "text": "Eighty-threeâ€‰years old woman following fall was on conservative management at another hospital. She had no neurological deficit. A week later her back pain aggravated and two weeks later developed bilateral buttock pain, bilateral lower limb weakness and diminished sensation in the sacral area. Radiological investigations (X-rays, Magnetic resonance imaging and Computed tomography) showed L1 vertebral body fracture with vacuum cleft and fracture fragment retropulsed into the spinal canal. A diagnosis of Kummell's disease with burst fracture of L1 vertebra & neurological deficit was made. Patient was managed with Polymethylmethacrylate augmented, posterior compressed, short segment percutaneous pedicle screw fixation. The reduction of the retropulsed fragment was achieved by virtue of \"Pivot ligamentotaxis\". The patient got relieved of the symptoms (Preoperative VAS 8 and postoperative VAS 3) and was allowed brace assisted ambulation on first postoperative day."
