  "text": "We report the case of a 54-year old man concomitantly diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma and M. malmoense pulmonary infection. We present detailed clinical, microbiological and radiological elements strongly arguing for M. malmoense true pathogenicity. Since M. malmoense infection has rarely been reported in France, we also provide elements of the epidemiological investigation and a literature review of potential acquisition and transmission pathways of M. malmoense. We detail therapeutic interventions and subsequent favorable evolution."
