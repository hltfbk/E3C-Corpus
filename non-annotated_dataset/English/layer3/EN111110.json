  "text": "We report two cases of primary and radiation-induced breast angiosarcoma (AS) after performing breast conserving surgery (BCS) for breast cancer. In case 1, a 72-year-old woman underwent right BCS with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer 5 years prior. She was diagnosed with AS of the right breast and underwent mastectomy with a wide skin resection of the breast. As the tumor cells were positive for c-myc, this tumor was diagnosed as a radiation-induced AS. In case 2, an 80-year-old woman underwent BCS without adjuvant RT. She was diagnosed with AS 3 years after BCS and underwent mastectomy with a wide skin resection of the breast. The tumor was diagnosed to be a primary AS because there were no episodes of RT or lymphedema. Both cases developed local recurrence within 1 year of surgery."
