  "text": "A case of ruptured mucocele resulting from cystadenoma of the appendix was presented as right inguinal hernia in a 70-year-old male. The patient underwent colonoscopy, x-ray, ultrasound and computed tomography. Localized pseudomyxoma peritonei associated with adenocarcinoma of the descending colon was diagnosed. The patient underwent segmental resection of the colon, appendectomy, debridement of pseudomyxoma and closure of the internal ring of right inguinal canal. He is free of symptoms in one year follow-up."
