  "text": "A 56-year-old African American woman presented to our emergency center with complaints of a mass protruding from her vagina. She subsequently underwent vaginal myomectomy, abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathologic examination revealed a necrotic fibroid and endometrium. At the time of laparotomy an inverted uterus was diagnosed when a 3 cm dimple containing bilateral round ligaments, infundibulopelvic ligaments and bladder was observed."
