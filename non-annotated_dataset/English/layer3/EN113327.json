  "text": "A 52-year old man, who had undergone allogenic bone marrow transplantation, suffered from rapid-growing brain masses in addition to pneumonia and died within 1Â month from the onset of the symptoms including fever, headache and disorientation. Infection with Acanthamoeba in the brain and lung was confirmed by histological evaluation; immunohistochemical staining and polymerase chain reaction analysis using autopsy samples also indicated the growth of Acanthamoeba in the brain. Gene sequence analysis indicated that this is the second documented case of infection with Acanthamoeba spp. with genotype T18 in a human host. Postmortem retrospective evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid sample in our case, as well as literature review, indicated that some cases of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis caused by Acanthamoeba may be diagnosable by cerebrospinal fluid examination."
