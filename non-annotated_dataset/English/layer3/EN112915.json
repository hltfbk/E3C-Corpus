  "text": "We describe a case of posterior interosseous nerve palsy caused by synovial osteochondromatosis of the elbow in a 66-year-old Japanese man. A three-dimensional reconstructed image based on magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine the location and shape of the giant tumor, which was composed of bone and cartilage. After surgical resection of the giant tumor and neurolysis of the posterior interosseous nerve, he fully recovered from nerve palsy 9 months postoperatively. There was no recurrence of the lesion 1 year postoperatively."
