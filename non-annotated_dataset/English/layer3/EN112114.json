  "text": "A healthy 16-year-old male presented with blurred vision in his left eye. Vitreous hemorrhage occurred and absorbed spontaneously. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated a Mittendorf's dot and fundus examination revealed a persistent hyaloid artery. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a Bergmeister's papilla. The blood flow of the persistent hyaloid artery via the Bergmeister's papilla was found by OCT angiography."
