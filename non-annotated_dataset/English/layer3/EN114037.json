  "text": "A pediatric patient sustained a completely displaced fracture of the medial clavicle. The fracture was lateral to the medial physis of the clavicle and did not involve the sternoclavicular joint. Internal fixation was achieved in an anatomic position with an elastic intramedullary nail. The postoperative course was unremarkable and resulted in complete healing of the fracture in an anatomic position. The patient returned to full activities without any pain or dysfunction."
