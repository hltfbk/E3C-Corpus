  "text": "A 71-year-old male presented for a repeat biopsy of corpus callosum 4 days following the cancellation of the procedure for a presumed anaphylactic reaction to an unknown anaesthetic agent. During the repeat care episode, the decision was made to proceed based on the urgent need for tissue diagnosis to facilitate further treatment and lack of feasibility for more definitive identification of the causative agent(s). A consideration was made of the optimum ways to manage and mitigate risk in this setting. The airway was managed using flexible endoscopic intubation in a spontaneously ventilating awake patient. Continuous remifentanil infusion was maintained throughout the case. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane at less than one MAC, with an uneventful completion of the biopsy of corpus callosum. All of the anaesthetic agents used during the prior care episode, with the exception of remifentanil, were avoided."
