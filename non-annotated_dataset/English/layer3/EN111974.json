  "text": "An 84-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with weakness, lethargy and infectious secretions of the umbilicus. The patient had undergone hysterectomy 21 years before. Clinical examinations and accurate umbilicus explorations found a 0.5-mm fibrin and smelly umbilical secretions. Dragging found the fibrin to be a surgical gauze thread. The patient was therefore identified as a candidate for laparotomy, which revealed a long gauze attached to a band and a metal ring in the umbilicus and hypogastric regions as well as a large abscess containing 200 ml of infectious secretions, severe adhesions of the intestines to each other and to the abdominal wall, a 10Ã—10 cm cavity and an approximately 1-cm fistula or laceration in the Ileum due to the foreign body (long gauze). The patient was discharged from the hospital in good health conditions after the final surgery."
