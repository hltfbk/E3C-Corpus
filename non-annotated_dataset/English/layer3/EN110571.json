  "text": "A 39-year-old male, smoker with generalized anxiety disorder, presented with a two-week history of chest pain and dyspnoea. Hemodynamically he was stable with a pulse rate of 78beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/105mmHg and an oxygen saturation of 87%. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and symmetrical T-wave inversions in leads V1 to V4. Cardiac troponin T was elevated, 37ng/L. Chest radiograph was unremarkable. Computed tomography angiogram of pulmonary arteries (CTPA) revealed a large saddle shaped thrombus in main pulmonary artery, extending into the right and left pulmonary arteries as well as to the segmental branches on both sides. In addition, a solitary nodule was seen in the right lower lobe measuring 16 x 10 mm, laterally and just posterior to oblique fissure. Echocardiogram, showed features of right ventricular strain. Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index score was 89 points suggesting Class III, intermediate risk. Since the patient was not hemodynamically unstable, systemic thrombolysis was not considered. Owing to persistence of symptoms and desaturation, the high thrombus load and the young age, a multidisciplinary team decision was made to proceed with catheter directed thrombolysis. He showed a remarkable response with total disappearance of his symptoms and improvement in oxygen saturation. Anticoagulation was continued with Rivaroxaban. Patient did not have any known predisposing factors for pulmonary embolism (PE). Malignancy being a risk factor, the rounded opacity in the lung of a smoker needed further evaluation. Patient was readmitted after 4 weeks and a CT guided percutaneous biopsy was done. Unfortunately, it was reported as nondiagnostic as it showed only normal tissue without any evidence for granuloma or malignancy. Whole body [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) three months later showed the nodule to be FDG avid with a maximum standardized uptake value of 2.8.. Knowing about a possible mass in his lungs, the patient was very anxious all along. Again, a multidisciplinary decision was made for excision biopsy weighing the surgical risks in this case with the possibility of malignancy. Excision of the nodule was done through video assisted thoracosopic surgery. Histopathology showed only a localized area of old infarction, 8 mm in maximum dimension without any evidence for malignancy or granuloma. Rivaroxaban was withheld for 48 hours for the percutaneous biopsy and was bridged with unfractionated heparin for the surgical biopsy. Patient was reassured and later had an uneventful follow up in the out-patient clinic."
