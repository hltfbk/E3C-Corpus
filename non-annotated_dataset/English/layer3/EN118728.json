  "text": "We report a rare combination of vascular variations in a 48 years old male cadaver, included the retroaortic left renal vein opening in to the left common iliac vein, an accessory renal artery arising from the left common iliac artery which supplied the lower end of left kidney and left testicular artery originating from left renal artery. Clinical and embryological back ground of the above mentioned variations have been discussed in this paper."
