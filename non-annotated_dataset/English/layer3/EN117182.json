  "text": "We present the case of a 15-month-old Asian male baby who presented with precocious puberty associated with hepatoblastoma. Serum concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein and free testosterone were elevated, as was beta human chorionic gonadotropin hormone. He was treated with six courses of chemotherapy and underwent surgery. His surface markers as well as free testosterone level returned to normal during therapy. The child has now been off therapy for 18 months with no evidence of tumor recurrence at follow-up."
