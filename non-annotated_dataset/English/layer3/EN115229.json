  "text": "A 24Â year old male presented with blunt chest pain and respiratory distress. A CT scan was performed which showed large heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue mass occupying the left hemithorax. It measures 18.5 X 15.8 X 7.6. Thoracotomy with excision of the tumor was done. Operative findings include multilobulated and nodular large glistening white tumor located in anterior mediastinum adherent to parietal pleura and effacing the pulmonary parenchyma. However tumor was not connected or seems to originate from trachea or lung. Microscopic sections show neoplastic lesion composed of nests, cords and trabeculae of small to medium sized cells with round nuclei and clear cytoplasm. Background showed myxoid appearance with areas of cartilaginous differentiation. Immunohistochemical expression of CKAE1/AE3, p63, ASMA, S100 and GFAP favored the diagnosis of benign myoepithelioma."
