  "text": "Here we report an untreated 86-year-old New Zealand European white man with IgA myeloma whose paraprotein decreased by 57%, consistent with a partial response, after a course of roxithromycin for pneumonia. His paraprotein reduced from 46 to 20 g/L while his hemoglobin improved from 97 to 123 g/L after 1 month."
