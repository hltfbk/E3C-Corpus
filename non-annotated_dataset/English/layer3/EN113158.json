  "text": "We report a 54-year-old female who was investigated for a poorly resolving fever and recent weight loss for two months. During her course of illness, she developed bilateral multiple opacifications in the chest radiograph with negative pyogenic, mycobacterial microbiological studies. Despite intravenous antibiotics, her fever continued. She was found to have elevated alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase and she underwent imaging with ultrasound scan of abdomen twice, which did not reveal demonstrable abnormalities. Later, contrast CT of abdomen and chest was performed and detected a renal cell carcinoma of the right upper pole of the kidney with multiple lung metastases, which was concluded as a metastatic RCC with paraneoplastic Stauffer's syndrome."
