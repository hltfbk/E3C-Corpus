  "text": "We report a case of an adult in his 5(th )decade immunosupressed with methilprednisolone, tacrolimus and micophenolate who two months after renal transplantation, multiple infections and an episode of humoral rejection became hypertensive with severe headaches, visual field abnormalities, seizures, left hemiparesis and hemineglect. Computed Tomography scan of the brain showed a hypo dense lesion in the left occipital lobe. Ischemic stroke was diagnosed and aspirin and permissive hypertension were indicated. Twelve hours later he developed left sided motor seizures and cortical blindness. Magnetic Resonance Image showed hyper intensity in T2 and FLAIR in both occipital lobes and a small area of cortical restricted diffusion in Diffuson Weighted Images in the left occipital lobe. With a diagnosis of Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome his blood pressure was controlled with intravenous labetalol, and two days later the neurologic findings returned to baseline and most Computed tomography findings resolved."
