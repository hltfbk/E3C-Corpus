  "text": "A 47-year old man presented with pain in the TMJ (temporomandibular joint) and whose aesthetic concern was having a chipped maxillary central incisor veneer. The concern was solved following a fully digital workflow: it was applied the digital smile design protocol, as well as CAD-CAM monolithic lithium disilicate ceramic veneers and crowns (following a minimal invasive preparation approach). The aim of this rehabilitation was to solve a loss of vertical dimension, subsequent aesthetics and temporomandibular joint disorders."
