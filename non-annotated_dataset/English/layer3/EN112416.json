  "text": "Here we describe a female proband with a severely manifested restrictive phenotype leading to heart transplantation at the age of 41, who was found homozygous for the novel TNNI3 mutation: NM_000363.4:c.586G > C, p.(Asp196His). Her parents were third-degree cousins originating from a small village and although they were found heterozygous for the same variant they displayed no symptoms of the disease. Her older sister who was also found heterozygous was asymptomatic. Her twin sister and her brother who were homozygous for the same variant displayed a restrictive and a hypertrophic phenotype, respectively. Their children are all carriers of the mutation and remain asymptomatic until the age of 21."
