  "text": "A 69-year-old female with a PEG in position and in use for more than a month started complaining of severe abdominal pain. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) tubogram revealed rupture and separation of the PEG tube into two fragments. Interventional radiology (IR) team was successful with their conservative approach. Both fragments were removed conservatively without the need for laparotomy. The distal fragment was utilized to place a guide wire, and a new PEG was placed in position with no intraabdominal leak."
