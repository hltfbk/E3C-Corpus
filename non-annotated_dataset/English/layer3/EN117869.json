  "text": "Female 64 years old patient with history of hypothyroidism, depression and anxiety disorder was examined at outpatient Memory and Dementia clinic of 3rd Department of Neurology. The patient's major problems were functional and cognitive decline, severe extrapyramidal symptoms and depression. According to UKPDS Brain Bank criteria the patient had bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, postural instability and rest tremor present with unilateral onset of the symptoms affecting left side most and progressive course. The modified Hoehn and Yahr scale was 3: mild to moderate bilateral disease; some postural instability; physically independent. The symptoms remained during nine months follow up, despite the pharmaceutical treatment. Nine months later, the patient made an attempt to suicide. Firstly, she was transferred to intensive care department with 2nd degree burns and respiratory problems, then she was hospitalized at the Burn Unit and afterwards at the Psychiatric clinic. One month later the patient had no depression, a clear reduction of the extrapyramidal symptoms, functional and cognitive improvement."
