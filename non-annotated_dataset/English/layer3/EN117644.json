  "text": "A 28-year-old Caucasian woman was diagnosed with a transperitoneal sarcoma during pregnancy. Morphological, immunohistochemical, chromosomal and mutational analyses pointed towards a high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. Although surgery and chemotherapy are possible during pregnancy, we were unable to perform these in this case."
