  "text": "We report a case of 67-years- old woman who presented in the dermatology clinic after a surgical removal of an enlarged lymph node in her left femoral area, verified histologically as a metastasis of melanoma. After a diagnostic refinement in the clinic, the diagnosis of metastasis of malignant melanoma was confirmed by histology revision. We use the presented case to create for the first time in the world literature a novel stereotype of thinking, which is also followed by a stereotype of clinical behaviour - gentle to the patient, but providing a certain amount of security and satisfaction for the medical staff."
