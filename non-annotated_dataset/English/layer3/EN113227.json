  "text": "A 33-year-old Korean nulliparous woman was referred to our hospital because she suffered lower abdominal pain and had missed her periods after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination. We could not identify any normal gestational sac in the endometrium, or specific ectopic pregnancies, on an initial ultrasound scan. However, there was a large hematoma in the cul-de-sac and free fluid in the right paracolic gutter. We decided to perform emergent laparoscopic surgery. We found contralateral tubal and ovarian ectopic pregnancies."
