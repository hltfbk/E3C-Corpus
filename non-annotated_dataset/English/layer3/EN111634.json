  "text": "We present a case of a 55-year-old, gravida IV para III, Ethiopian woman from Ethiopia with a retained fetus and vesicovaginal fistula after an obstructed labor and a neglected intrauterine fetal demise of approximately 22 years. The diagnosis was confirmed by suggestive clinical history, physical examination findings, and an abdominopelvic computed tomography scan. Laparotomy and removal of the lithopedion was done and our patient was sent to a fistula hospital for vesicovaginal fistula repair."
