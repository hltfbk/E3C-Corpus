  "text": "A-35-year old male presented with fever and dull aching pain in left hypochondriac region. Radiological evaluation showed presence of multiple abscesses in spleen. Investigations were done to rule out common causes of abscess in spleen. After failure of medical management, he was subjected to elective splenectomy. There were dense adhesions between the spleen and the adjacent structures and the diaphragm. The histopathology of the resected specimen showed hemangiopericytoma of spleen."
