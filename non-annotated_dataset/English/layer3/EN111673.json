  "text": "A 55-year-old Chinese woman with an 8-year history of BCa presented with lower back pain that had persisted for 3 mo. The patient underwent bilateral modified radical mastectomy and subclavian and submandibular clearance, and received systemic treatment, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy during treatment. Ureteroscopy did not acquire a satisfactory biopsy. Thus, laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was performed, and ureteral metastases of BCa were pathologically confirmed. As suggested by her oncologist, she continued to receive apatinib. Postoperative 3-mo follow-up indicated further progression of axillary lymph node metastases."
