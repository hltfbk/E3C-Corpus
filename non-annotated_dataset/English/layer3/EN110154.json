  "text": "We report the case of a 33 year old woman patient admitted for a progressive bilateral visual loss since two weeks. Ophthalmologic examination revealed visual acuity of counting fingers in both eyes; and pupils were briskly reactive with no relative afferent papillary defect. Anterior segment examination in both eyes was unremarkable. Fundus examination showed bilateral stellate neuroretinitis. Physical examination revealed a malignant hypertension of 210/150mmHg. Magnetic resonance imaging identified a left suprarenal mass, whereas urinary catecholamine level was abnormally high which supported a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The patient underwent a laparoscopic left suprarenal adrenalectomy after successful control of blood pressure. histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Postoperative evolution was uncomplicated. Antihypertensive treatment lasted only a few months. Visual acuity was restored and the retinal alterations disappeared 7 months after surgery."
