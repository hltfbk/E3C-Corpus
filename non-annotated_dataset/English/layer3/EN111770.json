  "text": "A 49-year-old man with no other medical co-morbidities underwent LT in 2013 for alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The donor was a 73-year-old female with no known malignancies. Early after LT, a hypoechogenic (15 mm) lesion was detected in the left hepatic lobe on abdominal ultrasound. The lesion was stable for next 11 mo, when abdominal magnetic resonance identified two hypovascular lesions (20 and 11 mm) with atypical enhancement pattern. Follow-up abdominal ultrasound revealed no new lesions for the next 2.5 years, when magnetic resonance showed a progression in size and number of lesions, also confirmed by abdominal computed tomography. Liver biopsy proved a well-differentiated NEN. Genetic analysis of the NEN confirmed donor origin of the neoplasm. As NEN was confined to liver graft only, in 2018, the patient underwent his second LT. At 12 mo after re-LT the patient is well with no signs of NEN dissemination."
