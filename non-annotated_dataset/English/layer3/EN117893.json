  "text": "We report the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian man who presented with acute onset of dysarthria and dysphagia initially attributed to a brain stem stroke. Oculobulbar and limb weakness progressed until myasthenia gravis was diagnosed and treated, and until statin therapy was finally withdrawn."
