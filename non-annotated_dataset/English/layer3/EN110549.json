  "text": "A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was made in a 17-year-old girl after she presented acutely with features consistent with diabetic keto-acidosis at the age of 11 years. She had presented with osmotic symptoms, a random blood glucose level of 448mg/dl (28.4mmol/L), ketonuria (3+) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C-11.0%). The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was made based on the high titre levels of auto-antibodies (anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase and anti-insulinoma associated antibodies) and low level of serum C-peptide, (Table 1). The patient's body mass index (BMI) at the time of diagnosis was 23.8kg/m 2 with no markers suggestive of insulin resistance like acanthosis nigricans. Screening for antibodies associated with possible autoimmune thyroiditis was negative. Also there was no evidence of dyslipidaemia and blood pressure was within normal range. She was put on insulin treatment, (total daily insulin of 92-122units/day) with subcutaneous insulin glargine (a long-acting insulin analogue) and regular insulin at bed time and before three main meals respectively since discharged from hospital at diagnosis. She was the second of four siblings of her non-diabetic parents but had siblings who had type 1 diabetes. There was no history or clinical evidence suggestive of PCOS as her menstrual cycle was regular with no hirsutism or acne.\nHowever, 6 years post-diagnosis, she was noticed to have developed diffuse widespread acanthosis nigricans around the neck and axillary region indicating insulin resistance and her weight increased significantly compared to when she was diagnosed of type 1 diabetes 6 years earlier. Her present BMI was 33.4kg/m 2, however her BP, fasting lipids profile were all normal. Hence, with these new features in the patient, she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes on a background of type 1 diabetes (“double diabetes”). Moreover, she was counselled on lifestyle modification (diet and exercise) and metformin 1g twice daily added to her insulin. Within a period of 2 months, her daily insulin requirement reduced from 92-122 units to 48 units with significant improvement in her glycaemic profiles, her latest HbA1C was 8.3%."
