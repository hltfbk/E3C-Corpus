  "text": "We report the case of a 35-year-old single Moroccan woman. She presented chronic pelvic pain, hematemesis and blurring of vision in the left eye. Clinical examination showed a pelvic mass and an exophthalmos with a divergent strabismus in the left eye. Pelvic and abdominal ultrasound showed a right tissular ovarian mass. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an ovarian tumor and bone metastasis. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a hypertrophy of the left inferior rectus muscle behind the exophthalmos. Stomach endoscopy revealed an ulcerated and protruded mass of the antro-fundic junction. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry showed an infiltration of the gastric mucosa by atypically isolated signet ring cells similar to the tumor cells found in the ovarian histopathological exams."
