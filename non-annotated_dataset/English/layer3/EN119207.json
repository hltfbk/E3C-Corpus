  "text": "A 40 year old African-american female presented with refractory neurosarcoidosis. Over the course of several years, the patient was treated with high dose steroids, imuran, cytoxan, and cyclosporine without benefit. Then, the patient received thalidomide, slowly escalating to 650 mg. After 2 months radiologic improvement was noted and after 6 months clinical stabilization and improvement became apparent."
