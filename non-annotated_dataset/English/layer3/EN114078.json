  "text": "A 51-year-old African-American woman with a history of sickle cell anemia presented for the evaluation of significant bilateral shoulder pain that was confirmed to be AVN via radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging of both her humeral heads without joint collapse. She tried and failed conservative management with physical therapy and optimization of sickle cell treatment with pain medications for years, so she desired surgical management. Arthroscopically assisted core decompression of her humeral heads with synthetic grafting was performed in an attempt at joint preservation."
