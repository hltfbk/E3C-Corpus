  "text": "A 67-year-old man developed decreased VA in his right eye due to an SMH. The VA was 20/50, and monthly intravitreal injection of aflibercept was administered three times. The SMH gradually decreased, and 10 months later the external limiting membrane was found to be perforated, resulting in MH. The old clot disappeared, and the MH remained for 10 months. Twenty-three months later, serous retinal detachment (SRD) involving the macula appeared and the MH had disappeared. SRD gradually disappeared, and macular configuration recovered. VA gradually improved and became 20/20 38 months later."
