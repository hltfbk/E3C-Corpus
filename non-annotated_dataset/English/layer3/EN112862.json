  "text": "A 65-year-old man who was diagnosed with PCS was treated by surgical removal of the primary lung lesion, followed by six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin plus irinotecan. Following the chemotherapy, he experienced a relapse with brain metastasis, which induced the rapid onset of left leg paralysis. Radical surgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery to the resection cavity were performed. However, meningeal dissemination and new lung metastases occurred after a year and half. To control these multiple metastatic lesions, the patient was treated with the multiple kinase inhibitor pazopanib. No change was observed in the meningeal dissemination, while the metastatic lung lesions were prominently reduced in size following treatment with pazopanib. Consequently, the patient showed a partial response to pazopanib treatment, although the dose of pazopanib was reduced by half as a result of thrombocytopenia."
