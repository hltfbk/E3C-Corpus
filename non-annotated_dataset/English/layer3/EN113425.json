  "text": "The patient is middle-aged male aged 40 years, with higher basal metabolic index (BMI) and was diagnosed having a Haglund's bump and was on conservative treatment for a period of over 6 months, with minimal relief. We did ECP with the patient in lateral decubitus position using two lateral portals instead of using one medial and one lateral portal, his American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society score has improved from 64 to 98, and his Fowler-Philip angle is reduced from 71° to 45°."
