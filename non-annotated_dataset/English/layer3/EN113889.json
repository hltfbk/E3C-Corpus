  "text": "A 21-year-old male presented with severe pain on the right carpus following a fall with injury to right hand. There was a mild swelling at fifth CMC joint region and a bony prominence was felt dorsally, little finger presented an abduction deformity, and there was apparent shortening of the fifth ray. A diagnosis of isolated dislocation of fifth CMC dislocation was made based on radiographs. Immediate closed reduction was done in emergency room by applying longitudinal traction and direct pressure on metacarpal base dorsally, reduction was stable and confirmed by postreduction radiographs."
