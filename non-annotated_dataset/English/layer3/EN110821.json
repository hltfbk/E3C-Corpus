  "text": "A 40-year-old Japanese man presented with chronic dry cough and progressing paraplegia. Radiological examination revealed diffuse pulmonary abnormalities in bilateral lungs, focal demyelinating lesions of the spinal cord, and white matter lesions in the brain. He was diagnosed with GLILD based on marked lymphocytosis detecting in bronchoalveolar lavage, and transbronchial-biopsy proven T-cellular interstitial lung disease with granulomas. Microbiological examinations did not reveal an etiologic agent. The patient was also diagnosed with HIV-associated vacuolar encephalomyelopathy on the basis of an elevated HIV viral load in cerebrospinal fluid. After initiating ART, the brain lesions and paraplegia improved significantly, and interstitial abnormalities of the lungs and cough disappeared."
