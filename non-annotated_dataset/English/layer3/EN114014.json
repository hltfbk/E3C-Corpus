  "text": "A 12-year-old, left limb dominant boy with tenderness in the right groin as the only clinical finding and sclerotic shadow over ischiopubic region on X-ray posed a challenge for diagnosis. With further studies by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis was done. Hence, we are presenting a case labeled as Van Neck-Odelberg disease."
