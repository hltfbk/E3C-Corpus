  "text": "This case history describes a 28 year old female with a 24th week pregnancy gravida 2 para 0 with a DeBakey Type I aortic dissection, diagnosed via ultrasound. Surgery was perfomed on the day of diagnosis. After conferral with the mother, caesarean section was performed and a 690 g fetus could be delivered and was immediately transferred to the neonatal unit. Subsequent aortic repair was performed after hysterectomy, with replacement of the ascending aorta and hemiarch treatment. Intraoperatively no entry in the ascending aorta or transverse arch could be demonstrated, so that a retrograde Type A with entry distal to the left subclavian had to be postulated. We decided to perform subsequent computer tomography, demonstrating multiple entry sites in the descending aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. Successful endovascular treatment could be performed with a Medtronic Valiant Stent via a transfemoral approach. The further hospital stay was uneventful and the patient could be discharged on the 18th postoperative day. The baby demonstrated fighter qualities and could be discharged home after a 3 month hospital stay to be reunited with his mother."
