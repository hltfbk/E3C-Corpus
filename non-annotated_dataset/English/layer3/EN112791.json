  "text": "A 40-year-old female presented with radiculopathy and bilateral lower limb claudication for 5 months. Radiological investigations showed compressive lesion resembling flavum hypertrophy and a degenerative etiology was thus suspected. However, histopathology report pointed toward tuberculosis (TB) of the posterior elements (atypical form). Management with surgical decompression and anti-Koch treatment gave a successful outcome."
