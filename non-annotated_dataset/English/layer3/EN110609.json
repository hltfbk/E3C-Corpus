  "text": "A 50-year-old female presented with a 2-month history of progressive left foot drop with a gradual development of swelling over the left fibular head. Imaging suggested ganglion cyst-induced peroneal nerve palsy. Initial conservative treatment failure warranted surgical excision which confirmed extraneural origin on histopathological examination. An immediate clinical improvement was observed postoperatively and full recovery occurred within 6 months. There was no recurrence at 2 years follow up."
