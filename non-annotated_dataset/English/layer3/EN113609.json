  "text": "An 18-year-old boy presented with complaints of difficulty in walking with growing deformity with restriction and painful movements of knee joints bilaterally. The patient gives a history of swelling which was initially there about 8 years back and was accompanied by fever. The patient has taken some treatment for the same by local medics but has not been relieved of his symptoms. Patient's symptoms are insidious in onset and have gradually progressed in its severity. The patient first noticed swelling over knee right side, which was accompanied by a fever followed by progressive deformity. He gave a history of locking in both knee joints. The patient gives no definitive history regarding any definitive treatment taken for his complaints."
