  "text": "In this report, we present the case of a 42-year-old African man with AIDS who was undergoing anti-retroviral therapy. He was found to have a giant condyloma acuminatum of the scrotum. Wide surgical excision and scrotal reconstruction with a pedicled anterolateral thigh flap was performed, significantly improving his quality of life."
