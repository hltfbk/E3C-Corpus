  "text": "A 69-year-old woman presented with right knee pain. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging showed an osteolytic lesion with a large soft-tissue extension into the distal femur. Under a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin based on the biopsy specimen, resection and replacement with an artificial joint were performed. Histologic analysis of the resected material confirmed epithelioid angiosarcoma, supported by immunoexpression of cytokeratins and vascular markers. Three months after surgery, metastasis to the bone and lymph nodes was observed, and the patient died of the disease shortly thereafter."
