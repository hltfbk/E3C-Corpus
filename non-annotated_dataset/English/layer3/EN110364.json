  "text": "A 6-year-old girl was admitted for seizure without family history. Neurological examination was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a hypodense area in the right temporal region, with contrast enhancing solid as well as large cystic components. A right temporal craniotomy was performed and the tumor was excised. The pathologic examination revealed a markedly desmoplastic tumor, showing deposition of dense collagen fibers. The neoplasic cell population was heterogenous, composed of spindle-shaped astrocytes with a fascicular arrangement. These cells show intense immunoreactivity for GFAP. Scattered ganglion cells with copious cytoplasm and irregular nuclei were also observed, indicating neuronal differentiation. These neuronal cells express synaptophysin. No mitosis or necrosis was present."
