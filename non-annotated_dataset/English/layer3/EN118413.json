  "text": "A rare arterial anomaly was found in a 61-year-old female cadaver consisting of an arterio-arterial malformation between a high-origin radial artery and the brachial artery within the cubital fossa. The high-origin radial artery arose from the axillary artery, deep to the pectoralis minor muscle. It coursed superficially through the anterior compartment of the arm, converging with the more deeply placed brachial artery in the cubital fossa."
