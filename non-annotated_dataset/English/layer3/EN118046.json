  "text": "A 20-year-old female presented with right temporal hemianopsia and visual loss in the right eye suddenly. A caf√©-au-lait spot was found on her neck and left shoulder. Endocrinologic examination revealed elevated basal level of serum PRL, FT(3 )and FT(4 )with decreased serum TSH. Fibrous dysplasia (FD) generally manifest as round-glass appearance with well defined borders and cystic areas within involved bone were seen as hypointensity on CT. They were showed as hypointense in T1-weighted sequences and as hyperintense in T2-weighted sequences of MRI. After surgery the right temporal hemianopsia improved."
