  "text": "A 23-month-old full-term Moroccan baby boy born to a non-consanguineous couple was referred to our hospital with the complaint of sudden onset left-sided hemiparesis. On neurological examination, there were no signs of meningeal irritation, his gait was hemiplegic, tone was decreased over left side, power was 2/5 over left upper and lower limb, and deep tendon reflexes were exaggerated. Preliminary neuroimaging suggested an arterial ischemic process. Clinical and laboratory evaluation excluded hematologic, metabolic, and vasculitic causes. Cerebral angiography confirmed the diagnosis of moyamoya disease. Our patient was treated with acetylsalicylic acid 5 mg/kg per day and referred to follow-up with pediatric neurosurgeon. Cerebral revascularization surgery using encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis was performed. At 8-month follow-up, his hemiparesis had improved and no further ischemic events had occurred."
