  "text": "A 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with unknown retroperitoneal tumor with benign right ovarian cyst and uterine fibroids, and she underwent laparotomy. The tumor was completely resected with a subsequent histopathological diagnosis of primary retroperitoneal mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (PRMC). Eighty months after surgery, she remains recurrence-free."
