  "text": "A 14-year-old male had a posterolateral elbow dislocation after a fall. Closed reduction with traction was performed. Radiographs after initial reduction showed a fragment entrapped into the humero-cubital joint. Computerized tomography scan showed the fragment belonging to the medial epicondyle. Open reduction and internal fixation with a 3.0 millimeter cannulated screw was performed, with restoring of the normal function of the elbow at final follow up."
