  "text": "We present a 22 year old woman with no history of systemic disease, who developed a cutaneous eruption with arthromyalgia and fever persistant for two weeks. There was no infective endocarditis. The viral serologies showed elevated titers of Ig M antibodies to CMV, suggesting CMV infection. The CMV antigenemia test was also positive. In further laboratory studies, we found leucopenia (3000/µL), lymphopenia (800/µL), thrombocytopenia (110000/µL), hemolytic anemia, anti nuclear factor positivity with high titer of anti DNA (600 UI/ml). There was also proteinuria (4g/day) that indicated kidney biopsy. Histological examination revealed stage II lupus nephritis. The cutaneous biopsy showed a positive lupus band test. The bone marrow aspirate showed hemophagocytosis. Corticosteroids therapy was started with antiviral therapy (Ganciclovir). But the patient presented seizures and her cerebral magnetic resonance imaging showed images of cerebral vasculitis. Pulse cyclophosphamide therapy was indicated but the patient get worse with increasing titers of leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and severe cytolysis. So intravenous immunoglobulin were started and leaded to a favorable outcome. There was a slow normalization of liver tests, hemostasis parameters and urinary sediments without seizure recurrence."
