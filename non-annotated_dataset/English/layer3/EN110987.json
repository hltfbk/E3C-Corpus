  "text": "A 52-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for chemoradiotherapy of lung cancer. He had no obvious history of gastrointestinal diseases, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy was initiated. Thirteen days after 2 cycles of cisplatin and vinorelbine, he experienced persistent hematochezia. Findings of the colonoscopy revealed edematous thickening from the rectum to the transverse colon, suggesting UC, drug-induced colitis, or infectious colitis. Results from bacterial culture were negative for Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Immunohistological staining for cytomegalovirus was also negative. Although he was clinically diagnosed with UC and treated with intravenous glucocorticoid, his symptoms gradually worsened and an abdominal X-ray revealed megacolon. Thirty-five days after conservative therapy, a total proctocolectomy with end permanent ileostomy was performed. Based on pathological findings and clinical course, he was diagnosed with UC."
