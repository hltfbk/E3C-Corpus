  "text": "A 70-year-old man, diagnosed with a rectal cancer (adenocarcinoma of rectum) with known history heavy cigarette smoking with no known history of peripheral vascular disease underwent a laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection. He presented severe pain in the left leg in the recovery room. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed the complete obstruction of the left common iliac artery. A successful revasculization was achieved through a thrombotectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with a stent immediately after the diagnosis. The pain in the left leg disappeared immediately after the revasculization."
