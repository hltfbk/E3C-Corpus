  "text": "A 76-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to an abnormal shadow on chest X-ray. He had a history of left nephrectomy with a diagnosis of UC in the renal pelvis 29 years previously. Computed tomography showed a mass lesion in the right middle lobe of the lung that measured 4.9 cm in diameter. A transbronchial biopsy revealed the tumor to be metastatic pulmonary UC, and he underwent right middle lobectomy of the lung."
