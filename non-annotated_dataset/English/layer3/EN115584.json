  "text": "We recently encountered a patient with acute kidney injury that was associated with minimal change disease in systemic lupus erythematosus. A 26-year-old Chinese woman who had a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presented with nephrotic syndrome and acute kidney injury. She fulfilled four of the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the classification of systemic lupus erythematosus. However, a renal biopsy revealed that there were no glomerular abnormalities or deposition of immune complex. Her generalized edema disappeared, and her high serum creatinine level decreased to normal after prednisolone therapy."
