  "text": "A 32-year-old Omani woman at 32-weeks gestation (gravida 2 para 1) was admitted with right iliac fossa pain, nausea and vomiting of 2 days duration, as well as a history of a similar episode one month earlier. On examination, a provisional diagnosis of appendicitis was made. Laparotomy revealed, however, that the right ovary was gangrenous and had undergone torsion."
