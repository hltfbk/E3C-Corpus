  "text": "We report successful and safe BLVR using an endobronchial valve in a patient with a huge bullous emphysema in the right middle lobe. A 65-year-old male was diagnosed with COPD 5â€‰years prior and had a large bullae in the right middle lobe at that time. During regular follow-up, the symptoms of respiratory distress gradually worsened, and the size of the bullae gradually increased on computed tomography (CT). Therefore, we decided to treat the patient via BLVR using an unidirectional endobronchial valve. The Chartis system (Pulmonx, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) confirmed the absence of collateral ventilation of the right middle lobe. We successfully inserted an endobronchial valve into the right middle bronchus. After insertion, the bullae decreased dramatically in size, and the patient's symptoms and quality of life improved markedly."
