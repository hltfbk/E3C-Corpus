  "text": "A 23-year old woman was admitted because of a direct ARDS for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy. Weeks before, an IGB has been removed because of abdominal pain and free intraabdominal air. Diagnostic work-up of free intraabdominal air, previous pain of the left shoulder and newly developed abscess pneumonia revealed a perforation of the posterior wall of the gastral antrum. This resulted in a left subphrenic abscess with destruction of the diaphragm, development of pneumonia per continuitatem and subsequent direct lung injury. The gastric perforation was endoscopically clipped and the ARDS was successfully treated under ECMO therapy."
