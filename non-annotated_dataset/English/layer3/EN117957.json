  "text": "We describe a 54-year-old Caucasian woman with mastitis due to M. abscessus. A few days after clinical evidence of mastitis, the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Subsequently, due to persistence of symptoms, a percutaneous breast biopsy was performed followed by surgical drainage. Initial cultures failed to grow micro-organisms and tissue histology showed chronic inflammatory reaction with giant cells. Several days after surgery, her symptoms recurred. Finally, M. abscessus breast infection was diagnosed and the patient was treated successfully."
