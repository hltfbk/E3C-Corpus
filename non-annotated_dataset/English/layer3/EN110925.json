  "text": "We describe the clinical presentation, radiological investigations, and strategies for the management of a 69-year-old patient who was a known case of RA, and he was non-diabetic. Patient presented with massive swelling around shoulder for the past 6 years. We performed radiograms, a plain computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, a 99m Tc-MDP bone scintigram, and a 67Ga-citrate scintigram, which all indicated no evidence of tumor. It was treated by excision and no recurrence observed after 5 years."
