  "text": "The case presented here is that of a 6-year-old boy who was born at 33 weeks to healthy, non-consanguineous Chinese parents. He presented with short stature (95 cm; <3rd percentile) and proteinuria. Initially suspected of having IgM nephropathy, the patient was finally diagnosed with mild Schimke immune-osseous dysplasia. One novel mutation (p.R817H) and one well-known mutation (p.R645C) was identified in the SMARCAL1 gene."
