  "text": "Our case is a 33-year-old gentleman who underwent revision lumbar spine surgery, for L3-L4 disc protrusion (recurrence) and L4-L5 disc protrusion with bilateral foot drop, in the form of posterior decompression, pedicle screw fixation from L3 to L5, and two-level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion using cages. The patient developed POVL involving one eye which was diagnosed on operating table itself (immediately after extubation). Immediate appropriate treatment was initiated with the cooperation of ophthalmologist. The patient subsequently recovered, from no perception of light, to a visual acuity of 6/24, and is doing well regarding vision as well as neurology."
