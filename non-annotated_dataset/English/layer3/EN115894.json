  "text": "In our present report, we describe the case of an 11-year-old Caucasian prepubertal girl who presented to our hospital with complaints of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, nausea and vomiting. The diagnostic workup led us to conclude that she had a torsion of the right ovary, which was cystically altered. Exploratory surgery revealed a partial hydrosalpinx and consecutive isolated torsion of the fimbrial part. The proximal isthmic part of the fallopian tube was intact and vital. Restorative surgery was performed to create a neosalpingostomy on the viable isthmic part of the tube and remove the cystic and twisted fimbrial and infundibular parts."
