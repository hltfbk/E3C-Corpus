  "text": "A 13- year-old boy presented with photophobia, pain and redness in the left eye (LE) for 1-week.There was no history of trauma. Ocular examination showed best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 6/36 in the right eye (RE) and hand movement in the left eye. The child had hypertelorism with ptosis and antimongoloid slant. Left eye revealed circumciliary congestion and dislocation of crystalline lens into AC. The right eye revealed superotemporal subluxation of normal lens. The intraocular pressure was 16mm of Hg in the RE and 36mm Hg in the LE. Systemic examination revealed dysmorphic facial features with low set large ears and short webbed neck. He had short stature with cubitus valgus and no secondary sex characters.There was no hepatospenomegaly and spinal changes. ECG revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with right axis deviation. Echocardiography showed patent foramen ovale with left to right shunt. The family gave a history of consanguinous marriage with normal middle aged parents and sibling. The patient gave a history of hernia repair surgery on the left side at 1 Â½ years of age. Based on systemic and ocular features, diagnosis of anteriorly dislocated lens with pupillary block glaucoma in LE and subluxated lens in RE in a case of NS was made. Karyotyping revealed normal male Karyotype. Intracapsular extraction of the dislocated lens through a corneoscleral incision was done under general anaesthesia. Postoperatively, the child was visually rehabilitated with aphakic glasses."
