  "text": "A 16-year-old girl presented with approximately 75 lesions on her inner thighs as a result of friction from an athletic uniform. She tried over-the-counter antibiotic ointment and topical steroids for several weeks without improvement, and was concerned at the rate of spread of the lesions, along with the social implications."
