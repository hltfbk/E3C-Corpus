  "text": "A 78-year-old female developed left groin pain associated with typical symptoms of femoral nerve palsy about 2weeks after left hip hemiarthroplasty[1, 2, 3]. Computed tomography revealed the presence of a left iliopsoas hematoma that was surgically drained. Inguinal pain was immediately relieved, while nerve palsy recovered only partially, but the quality of life drastically improved and she was able to walk using a walker without pain."
