  "text": "A 30-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a history of stepping over the Indian tiffin box. He presented with a tiffin box embedded in his right sole with food particles (pulses) inside the wound. It was associated with undisplaced, extra-articular fracture of calcaneus. Contamination with food particles and delayed presentation had added extra risk of infection. Aggressive management by wound lavage, debridement, and intravenous antibiotics has prevented the delayed complication like osteomyelitis."
