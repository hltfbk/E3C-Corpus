  "text": "A 22-year-old intoxicated male with no past medical history was admitted to the trauma bay in stable condition after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. On the primary survey, the patient was noted to be tachypneic with decreased breath sounds over his right hemithorax. Radiographic studies of his chest demonstrated a right proximal third clavicle fracture with inferior displacement with associated partial pneumothorax; the patient was also noted to have a right femoral shaft fracture. Neurovascular examinations of his extremities were normal. A chest thoracostomy tube was inserted and placed under suction. Computerized tomography studies later revealed that the fractured clavicle had penetrated the pleura and caused the partial lung collapse. The patient was initially placed in a sling and underwent intramedullary nailing of his femur on the day of presentation. Given the severe displacement of his clavicle fracture into the lung tissue resulting in pneumothorax, there was significant concern for nonunion and lack of resolution of the pneumothorax. 2 days after stabilization of his right femur fracture, the patient underwent open reduction with internal fixation of his right clavicle. Follow-up radiographs showed a healed clavicle fracture and resolved pneumothorax."
