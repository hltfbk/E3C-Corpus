  "text": "A 67-year-old man presented with complete paralysis (Medical Research Council: 0/5) of the left extremities at the onset of a right putaminal hemorrhage. At six weeks after onset, he presented with more severe weakness of proximal joint muscles than distal joint muscles (right shoulder abductor; 2-, finger extensor; 3+, hip flexor; 2+, ankle dorsiflexor; 3). Although his right hemiplegia had recovered well, he consistently showed more severe proximal weakness (right shoulder abductor; 3, finger extensor; 4, hip flexor; 3+, ankle dorsiflexor; 4) until 16Â weeks after onset. On both six- and 16-week DTTs, in the left (affected) hemisphere, the CRP showed severe narrowing with discontinuation of the anterior fibers at the corona radiata on six-week DTT, however, the discontinued anterior fibers of the CRP were connected to the right cerebral cortex via transcallosal fibers on 16-week DTT."
