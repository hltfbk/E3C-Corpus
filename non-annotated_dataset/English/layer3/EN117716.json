  "text": "A 68-year-old Caucasian man presented with fever and rest pain in the right lower extremity five months after the placement of a vascular expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft for femoral-popliteal bypass. Computed tomography angiography demonstrated peri-graft fluid that was aspirated percutaneously with image guidance and cultured to reveal E. cloacae. The graft was revised and then removed. The patient completed a six-week course of ceftazidime and is currently without signs of infection. There were no other reports of E. cloacae graft infections in any patients receiving treatment in the same surgical suite within a month of this report."
