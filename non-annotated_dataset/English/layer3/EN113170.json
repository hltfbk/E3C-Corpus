  "text": "A 44-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented with a 1-week duration of right-sided painful neck swelling. Duplex ultrasound and computed tomography angiogram revealed right IJV thrombosis. Hematology studies were normal apart from positive lupus anticoagulant. The patient was managed conservatively with low molecular weight heparin, antibiotics, and close follow-up."
