  "text": "A 44-year-old man presented with acute corneal hydrops related to penetration of Descemet's membrane and endothelium by an intrastromal ring segment implanted 7Â years prior. Removal of the ring segment resulted in an anterior chamber fistula that directed fluid through the ring segment tunnel to the ocular surface. Leakage of aqueous humor was successfully controlled, and corneal edema gradually resolved."
