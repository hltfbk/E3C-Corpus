  "text": "A 58-year-old Caucasian man who developed a persistent dry cough presented to our hospital. Imaging studies revealed a large pleural-based mass in the left lung. A biopsy of the mass showed a spindle-cell lesion consistent with a solitary fibrous tumor. The patient underwent surgical excision of the 13 cm mass. The pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a solitary fibrous tumor but also demonstrated discrete foci of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Until that point, a primary renal cell carcinoma tissue diagnosis had not been made and the initial radiological work-up was inconclusive."
