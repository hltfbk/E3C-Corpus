  "text": "A 26-year-old Sri Lankan male was admitted with fever for 3 days. Apart from generalized body aches there were no other significant symptoms. His blood counts showed pancytopenia. He was being treated for a resistant schizophrenia and clozapine was started only 4 weeks before. Common causes for pancytopenia were excluded, and a diagnosis of clozapine induced pancytopenia was made. He was managed in the intensive care unit with broad spectrum antibiotics, antifungals and granulocyte colony stimulating factors. He made a complete recovery after 4 weeks."
