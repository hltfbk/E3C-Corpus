  "text": "We report a patient with psoriasis treated with the biologic agents efalizumab (Raptiva) and etanercept (Enbrel), who developed painless lymphadenopathy with peripheral lymphocytosis during treatment, simulating a non-Hodgkin lymphoma clinically and pathologically. Lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy spontaneously remitted following cessation of etanercept therapy and have not recurred."
