  "text": "A 38-year-old male presented to the otorhinolaryngology clinic with a four-month history of change in voice. Laryngoscopy demonstrated a right glottic mass, raising suspicion of laryngeal cancer. The computed tomography showed a mass and incidental finding of opacities in lung apices. Chest x-ray demonstrated findings suggestive of tuberculosis. Polymerase chain reaction and culture of sputum samples confirmed the diagnosis and the patient was started on anti-tuberculosis treatment."
