  "text": "The patient was a 55-year-old woman with a transglottic squamous cell carcinoma of the T3N0M0 stage and PCF development following total laryngectomy surgery with total thyroidectomy and bilateral elective cervical lymph node dissection level I-IV. In spite of conservative treatment, the fistula was not recovered after 3 weeks. It was decided to perform fibrin glue injection into the fistula tract via the endoscopic approach. One month after the fibrin glue injection, no evidence of contrast extravasation was observed on barium swallow test, and the fistula was completely closed."
