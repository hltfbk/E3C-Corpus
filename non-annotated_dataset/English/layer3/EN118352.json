  "text": "We report a case who sustained a supracondylar fracture of the femur, which was managed initially by a dynamic condylar screw assembly. The patient sustained a peri implant fracture during her rehabilitation, which was managed by the application of a longer side plate. 4 months postoperatively the patient sustained another peri implant fracture. Using a minimally invasive method we removed the screws from the plate and passed an intramedullary implant. The whole assembly was rotationally stabilized using an Ilizarov fixator. The union proceeded uneventfully."
