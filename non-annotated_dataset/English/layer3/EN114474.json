  "text": "We identified two cases of meningeal carcinomatosis who had been diagnosed with malignant tumors several years ago. Both patients presented with progressive headache and seizures. Gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed and did not detect any abnormality of meninges. Lumbar puncture was performed repeatedly, but cerebrospinal fluid cytology showed no evidence of malignant cells. Finally the gadobutrol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging detected the meningeal metastasis, and supported the diagnosis of meningeal carcinomatosis."
