  "text": "Ten patients (8 men, 2 women) with Meckel's diverticulum underwent double-balloon enteroscopy at Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital from May 2004 through May 2013. Their median age was 31.5 years (range, 14-83 years). Ten retrograde and two anterograde double-balloon enteroscopy procedures were performed. Double-balloon enteroscopy showed Meckel's diverticulum in nine patients, but an inverted Meckel's diverticulum was diagnosed as a lipoma in one patient. Meckel's diverticulum was detected by iodinated contrast medium during anterograde double-balloon enteroscopy in one of the two patients who underwent this procedure. Meckel's diverticulum was suspected using capsule endoscopy in one of two patients who underwent this procedure. Abdominal computed tomography was performed in all patients and revealed abnormalities in six, but Meckel's diverticulum was suspected in only two. Technetium-99 m pertechnetate scintigraphy and a small bowel series were carried out in six patients, revealing Meckel's diverticulum in one and three patients, respectively. Surgery was performed in eight patients, and endoscopic resection was carried out in one; the remaining patient was transferred to another hospital. Ulcer formation was found in or near Meckel's diverticulum in eight patients."
