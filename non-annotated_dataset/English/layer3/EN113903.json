  "text": "we report a 13Â years old asian male patient rare case of ocular KS that was initiated from the sclera and progressed into the cornea and conjunctiva without an human Immunodeificiency Virus (HIV) or HHV-8 infection after a peripheral blood stem cells transplantation. In this case, anti- vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy was attempted to stop the advance of ocular lesions and failed. Eventually, the KS was cured by a limbo-corneal lamellar graft, an amniotic membrane and scleral allograft transplantation plus intraoperative mitomycin C(MMC) after the complete excision of the tumors."
