  "text": "A 79-year-old man was admitted for treatment of intractable GV due to liver cirrhosis. The GV were drained mainly into the left inferior phrenic vein, not the usual gastrorenal shunt. Introducing the balloon catheter to the left inferior phrenic vein was difficult due to mild stenosis between the inferior vena cava and inferior phrenic vein and the shunt angle. A CARTO technique was performed with 5% ethanolamine oleate with iopamidol from a single access route by inverting the steerable microcatheter distal to the coil placement site."
