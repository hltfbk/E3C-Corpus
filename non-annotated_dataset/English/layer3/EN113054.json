  "text": "We describe four new cases of reparative changes of a damaged hip joint after treatment with TNF inhibitors. The average of age was 32.5 (27- 36) years. There were 3 men and 1 woman. Hip involvement was bilateral in all cases. Etanercept was prescribed in 3 cases and infliximab in 1 case. At baseline, all patients had a painful and limited hip with high disease activity and an important functional impairment. After an average of 5.5 years of treatment with TNF inhibitors, the BASRI hip evaluated in antero-posterior x-rays of the pelvis remained unchanged at 2.4. The average of mean hip joint space was 2.9mm (2.3-3.6). A widening in hip joint space was observed in all cases with less subchondral cysts."
