  "text": "A 49-year-old female with a history of hyperthyroidism and atrial fibrillation (AF) was admitted to our hospital presenting with right upper limb pain and swelling. Initial transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated left ventricular apical mural thrombi and hyperthyroidism-induced cardiomyopathy. On the eighth day after admission, the patient developed sudden onset of severe chest pain and evidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Emergency coronary angiography revealed multi-site coronary embolization of the left anterior descending artery and a large diagonal branch. Despite emergency thrombo-aspiration and balloon angioplasty, the patient went into ventricular fibrillation, from which she did not recover."
