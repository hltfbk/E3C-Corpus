  "text": "A 14-year-old Yemeni girl with a recurrent history of urinary tract infections came to our clinic complaining of left flank pain with a frontal headache. Ultrasound showed a 3â€‰cm, well-defined echogenic lesion with mild vascularity. This lesion increased in size on her subsequent follow-ups. Computed tomography showed no intralesional fat, vessels invasion, or enlarged lymph nodes. The patient underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, and a pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of renal oncocytoma."
