  "text": "We present a patient who had epithelial ingrowth to the backside of the flap through a central LASIK flap laceration with a stellate shape. The patient had undergone uncomplicated bilateral LASIK surgery 3 years before the trauma. Because the epithelial ingrowth was suspected during the first visit 2 weeks after trauma, and definite epithelial ingrowth was noted during the additional 2 week observation period, the ingrown epithelial tissue was removed mechanically with a number 15 blade after lifting of the flap 4 weeks after the trauma. An amniotic membrane overlay was applied over the cornea and was sutured tightly to the episclera to firmly press down the flap to the remaining posterior stroma, to prevent growth of the epithelium again to the backside of the flap. At the last follow-up visit, 5 months after surgery, the patient's visual acuity remained stabilized with no sign of recurrent epithelial ingrowth."
