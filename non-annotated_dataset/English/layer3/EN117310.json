  "text": "We report the clinicopathological features of fulminant T cell lymphoproliferative disease that arose in the setting of acute primary Epstein-Barr virus infection. Our patient, a 23-year-old man, presented to our facility with persisting fever, hepatosplenomegaly and severe pancytopenia. On bone marrow biopsy, an abundant lymphoid infiltrate was observed. Immunophenotypic and molecular studies revealed that the atypical lymphoid cells displayed a CD8+, Epstein-Barr-encoded-RNA-positive T cell phenotype with clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor genes, the final diagnosis being systemic Epstein-Barr-virus-positive T cell lymphoproliferative disease. On reviewing the literature we found only 14 similar cases, all presenting with very aggressive clinical courses and requiring extensive phenotyping and molecular techniques for final diagnosis."
