  "text": "We describe the case of a premature baby boy, weighing 1030 g, born after 26 6/7 weeks gestation, who developed two episodes of Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome on days 19 and 48 of life. Cultures obtained during the first period did not reveal Staphylococcus aureus, but diagnosis was based on typical clinical grounds. Although the initial diagnosis was irritation by the fixation material of a nasal continuous positive airway pressure tube, the infant showed rapidly progressing skin blistering and exfoliation, characteristic of Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. After administration of antibiotic treatment, complete recovery was seen. In the second period, diagnosis of Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome was made clinically and confirmed by results of microbiologic investigations. Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the nose, skin lesions and the pharynx. The strain appeared to produce exfoliative toxin A. The clinical response to similar antibiotic treatment was identical to the first period of Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome."
