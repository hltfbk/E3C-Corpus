  "text": "We report a case of intra-abdominal desmoid tumor causing distal small bowel obstruction that complicated the management of a more proximal enterocutaneous fistula from the jejunum. After failure of more conventional management options including imatinib, the patient's disease responded to doxorubicin and ifosfamide. The response resolved the bowel obstruction and allowed small intestinal resection to resolve the enterocutaneous fistula."
