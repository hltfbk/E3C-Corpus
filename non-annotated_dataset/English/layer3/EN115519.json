  "text": "A seven year old boy presented with flexion deformity of wrist and hand with inability to use his left hand since three and half months subsequent to an injury to his left forearm due to fall from a tree of six feet height. The patient was diagnosed and treated by a native traditional bone setter for his Radius and Ulna fracture of left forearm with massaging and tight bandaging. On examination there was wasting of left forearm with positive Volkmann's sign, flexion contracture of wrist with loss of grip strength and tenderness over the upper and middle third junction of left ulna with a palpable gap. The radiograph of forearm revealed atrophic non-union of left ulna. In order to tackle both the issues, shortening osteotomy of radius with transposition of tubular radius intercalary graft onto ulna was done. Radius was fixed with a dynamic compression plate and Ulna was fixed with a rush nail effecting overall two and half centimetres shortening of both bones of forearm. This approach has addressed both atrophic non-union of ulna and VIC in a single stage and gave excellent functional outcome till the last follow-up of three years from the date of surgery."
