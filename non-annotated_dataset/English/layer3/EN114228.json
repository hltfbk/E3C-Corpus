  "text": "Between 2012 and 2013, 28 patients with infected total knee replacement (TKR) have been managed by our indigenous knee spacer. Minimal spacer-related complications and a stable knee joint with range of motion up to 100Â° were noted in these patients. After a mean period of 6-8 weeks, the spacer was removed and definitive TKR fixation done. At a mean follow-up of 4-months post second stage definitive surgery, patients were infection free with no evidence of recurrence of infection."
