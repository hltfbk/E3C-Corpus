  "text": "We report a case of a trifurcate intra-articular LHBT, a variation which, to our knowledge, has not been previously described. The patient was an adult male presenting with chronic atraumatic shoulder pain that worsened with overhead activity. On arthroscopy, the LHBT was found to have three origins from the (1) supraspinatus tendon, (2) superior labrum, and (3) rotator interval that joined together distally within the biceps tunnel. We believe the split tendon may have caused impingement the biceps tunnel; therefore, the patient was treated with subpectoral tenodesis. He also underwent subacromial decompression and rotator cuff debridement."
