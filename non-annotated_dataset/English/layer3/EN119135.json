  "text": "A 14-year-old girl presented with complaints of paraplegia, ataxia, fever and fatigue that had started a few months earlier and which had been getting worse in the last three weeks. Her laboratory results were indicative of macrocytic anemia with a serum B12 level <100 (normal, 160-970) pg/ml and hypersegmented neutrophils. Her MRI findings showed brain atrophy. Her fever workup eventually led to the diagnosis of tuberculosis which was documented by bone marrow aspiration smear & culture. A small bowel series showed that tuberculosis had typically involved the terminal ileum which had resulted in vitamin B12 deficiency. She was treated for vitamin B12 deficiency and tuberculosis. Her fever ceased and her hemoglobin level returned to normal. At present, she can eat, write, and speak normally as well as walk and ride a bicycle."
