  "text": "A 36-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of uterine prolapse presented with pregnancy. A vaginal pessary was applied to keep her uterus inside the pelvis after manual reposition. The pessary was removed at the 24th week. The gravid uterus persisted in the abdominal cavity because of its increased volume."
