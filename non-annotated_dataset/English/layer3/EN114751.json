  "text": "We included four dysmelic patients (five shoulders) with substantial glenoid dysplasia in a prospective database after approval by the local ethics committee. Once conservative treatment options had been exhausted, the patients were treated with shoulder arthroplasty and assessed clinically and radiographically before and after surgery. The mean patient age at the time of surgery was 50.4 years. The minimum follow-up time was 24 months (24-91 months). All patients experienced a considerable improvement of range of motion (ROM) and a relief of pain. No intra- or postoperative complications appeared."
