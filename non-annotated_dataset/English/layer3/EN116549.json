  "text": "A 15-year-old boy a product of non-consanguineous marriage brought with a history of short stature and poor development of secondary sexual characters. There were no adverse perinatal events, but weighed 1500 g (<3(rd)centile) at birth. He had delayed developmental milestones. He has had a poor appetite and feeding difficulties since childhood. On physical examination, he had a broad forehead, triangular facies, and low-set prominent ears. Asymmetry of the face, upper and lower extremities was noted, with hemihypertrophy on the right side. His height was 119 cm (<3(rd)centile) and weight was 18 kg which were low (<3(rd)centile) as per his age. He was biochemically euthyroid and GH stimulation testing with clonidine (0.15 mg/m(2)) showed low GH levels at 30', 60', and 90' were 1.7, 1.6, and 1.1ng/ml, respectively. On micturatingcystourethrogram, grade V complex was noted on the right side. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) showed normal functioning kidneys. He was started on recombinant GH with a height velocity of 10 cm/year."
