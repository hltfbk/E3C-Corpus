  "text": "A 64-year-old Caucasian female patient presented with a solitary nodule, located in the outer part of the external ear canal after repeated episodes of external otitis. For diagnostic purposes, computerized tomography was used. The patient underwent an excisional biopsy of the mass via an intra-aural incision and the surgical specimen was sent for histopathologic examination."
