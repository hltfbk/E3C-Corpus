  "text": "A 30-year-old patient, with no previous medical history was referred for a right-sided jugular-carotid lymphadenopathy, without fever or deterioration in general condition. A biopsy was performed in ENT unit confirming the diagnosis of lymph node tuberculosis. There were no other locations of tuberculosis. A 6 months anti-tuberculosis treatment has, therefore, been started. In the postoperative period, the patient began to complain of progressive partial functional impotence in the right shoulder accompanied by swarming in the right hand.\nThe clinical examination showed an anterolateral clean scar on the right side of the neck, fall of the stump of the shoulder, a muscle wasting of the trapezius muscle and sternocleidomastoid, and a slight detachment of the scapula. The active elevation of the right shoulder was limited compared to the opposite side. The pinching of the right trapezius caused slight pain. The rest of the neurological examination of the brachial plexus was unremarkable. The global physical examination was normal. The electromyogram (EMG) study showed a scattered motor response of the right ASN with amplitude collapse on simulation above the lymph node biopsy wound. The study of the right trapezius muscle showed a rich spontaneous activity in its upper portion with a poor temporal summation in effort. There were no other anomalies in the territories of the collateral branches and terminal nerves of the brachial plexus. The long thoracic nerve was normal. The EMG concluded to an axonotmesis of the right accessory spinal nerve. A brachial plexus MRI was performed showing wasting of the right trapezius muscle with denervation edema. Functional rehabilitation has, therefore, been scheduled. Surgery will be considered in case of failure."
