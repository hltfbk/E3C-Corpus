  "text": "A 64-year-old man with a medical history of mitral valve replacement had severe dyspnea and was symptomatic even at rest for 3 mo. His echocardiography showed severe native pure aortic regurgitation. His euroscore was 15. A TAVR procedure with an evolut R was planned. A 34 mm evolut R was placed by transesophageal echocardiography. The mitral prosthesis was functioning normally, and mild-moderate paravalvular leakage was evident by transesophageal echocardiography. The patient recovered without any complication. At 1 mo follow up, the patient was well, and no paravalvular leakage was noted."
