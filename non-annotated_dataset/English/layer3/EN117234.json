  "text": "A 36-year-old Asian Indian male, newly diagnosed with AIDS and treatment na√Øve, was started on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). He developed acute intestinal obstruction after four weeks of therapy. A laparotomy was done with excision and adhesiolysis leading to relief of symptoms. A histology report revealed the lesion to be Kaposi's sarcoma. Our patient was diagnosed to be having immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated with AIDS-associated gastrointestinal limited Kaposi's sarcoma, which presented as acute intestinal obstruction. Our patient was treated with paclitaxel post-operatively and HAART was continued. Our patient responded to therapy."
