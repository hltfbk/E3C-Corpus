  "text": "We report a case of a large plexiform schwannoma arising from the posterior tibial nerve in proximity with the medial malleolus. The patient had no history of ankle strain, fracture or neurofibromatosis type 2. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a multinodular, inhomogeneous lesion, measuring 6 x 4 x 2.8 cm. Fine needle biopsy was suggestive of a benign lesion, deriving from neural elements. The mass was excised marginally. Permanent section showed that the lesion was multilobular, surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule and consisting of elongated cells, rare typical mitosis, cells with degenerative features and stained positive for S-100 protein. The patient was not evident disease at the latest follow-up 2.3 years later, with an excellent functional result. No sensory or motor deficits were encountered."
