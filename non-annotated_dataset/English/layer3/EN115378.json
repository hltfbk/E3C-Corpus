  "text": "A 70-year-old male patient presented with severe tricuspid regurgitation and a history of decompensated right heart failure. One pacemaker lead was described as 'whipping'. Four years earlier he had received a VVIR pacemaker with a passive lead. This lead failed after three years and a new ventricular lead had been placed. We performed on-pump beating heart surgery after a multidisciplinary decision process. One lead was perforating the posterior papillary muscle, severely impairing valve movement. The tricuspid valve was replaced with a stented bioprosthesis. Epicardial pacemaker wires were placed on the right and left ventricle to enable cardiac resynchronization therapy in the case of postoperative heart failure. However, the patient recovered quickly without left ventricular pacing and could be discharged home 12Â days after surgery."
