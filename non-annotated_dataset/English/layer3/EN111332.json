  "text": "58 year old woman presented with right heart failure, kidney insufficiency and massive ascites related to portal hypertension caused by hepatic arterioportal fistula. She had a history of previous abdominal surgery. Colour Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography revealed a giant portal vein aneurysm related to large hepatic areterioportal fistula. Endovascular treatment was planned. Catheterization of the hepatic artery could not be realized due to severe tortuosity and angulation of the celiac artery and its branches. Access to the hepatic artery was obtained directly via percutaneous transhepatic route and fistula site was embolized with Amplatzer Vascular Plug II and coils. Immediate thrombosis of the aneurysm sac and draining portal vein was observed. Patients clinical status improved dramatically."
