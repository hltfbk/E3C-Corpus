  "text": "A 18-year-old male patient with preexisting autism spectrum disorder developed a severe catatonic syndrome over 2.5 years. The MRI showed normal findings, the EEG depicted intermittent slowing, and the independent component analyses showed additional sharp spikes. However, FDG PET, the basic laboratory analysis and testing of the serum/CSF for well-characterized antineuronal autoantibodies were unsuspicious. The serum and CSF \"tissue-based assay\" using indirect immunofluorescence on unfixed murine brain tissue revealed antineuronal autoantibodies against an unknown epitope in granule cells in the cerebellum and to neurites of hippocampal interneurons with a somatodendritic staining pattern. The immunosuppressive treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids, plasma exchange, and rituximab led to partial improvement."
