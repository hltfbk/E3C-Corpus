  "text": "An 86-year-old female patient presented to our department with a long pedunculated mass protruding from her mouth. Until this time, the patient had no dyspnea, dysphagia, or throat discomfort. Physical examination showed stable vital signs and clear consciousness. The pedicel was derived from the posterior wall of the hypopharynx. The tumor was smooth, hyperemic and dark red, about 10 cm long, and 4 cm wide. In order to prevent airway obstruction, the hypopharyngeal tumor was excised in emergent operation. The pharyngeal cavity was exposed by a mouth gag during the operation. A disposable plasma knife was used to completely remove the tumor along the base of the new organism, and no active bleeding occurred. The postoperative pathological results were sclerotic lipoma."
