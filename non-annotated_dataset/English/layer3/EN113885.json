  "text": "We report a case of a 35-year-old male Caucasian patient after a thumb injury due to a fall with his mountain bike. X-ray showed a fracture of the ulnar sesamoid of the MCPJ of the pollex, which is rarely reported in this literature. Anamnesis, clinical examination, and X-ray evaluation contributed to our diagnosis. The ulnar sesamoid bone fracture of the MCPJ of the right pollex was initially treated conservatively with immobilization, rest and ice application. After 3-4 weeks, physiotherapy with thenar muscles exercises was started. 10 weeks after the injury, our patient reported a total recovery of function and pain-free thumb movement during daily activities."
