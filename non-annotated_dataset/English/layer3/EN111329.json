  "text": "A 47-year-old man was admitted with a thoracic abscess and was noted incidentally on CT to have acute cholecystitis. Subsequently the patient then presented with massive fresh PR bleeding. This was found on CT to be the result of a cystic artery pseudoaneurysm with associated gallbladder fistulation to the hepatic flexure, secondary to cholecystitis. The patient was treated with coil embolisation of the cystic artery made a full recovery and was discharged with a view to performing an elective cholecystectomy."
