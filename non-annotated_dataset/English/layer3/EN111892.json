  "text": "We present a ten -year -old girl with four episodes of painless gross hematuria and recurrent microscopic hematuria since the age of two years. Doppler ultrasound showed left renal vein compression while 3 D computerized tomography angiography confirmed the diagnosis of an anterior nutcracker. The patient was conservatively treated with nutritional support (pediasure complete formula and high calorie food), iron supplements and followed up, monitored for anemia, hypertension and renal insufficiency."
