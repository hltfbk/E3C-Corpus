  "text": "Our patient presented with an episode of decompensated heart failure. Trans-thoracic echocardiography demonstrated excessive trabeculation with inter-trabecular recesses in the left ventricle typical of noncompaction of the left ventricle. The patient's admission was complicated by a cardiac arrest precipitated by ventricular tachycardia for which she subsequently underwent implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator."
