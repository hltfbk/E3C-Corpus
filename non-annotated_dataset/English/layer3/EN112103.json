  "text": "Here, we report clinical, laboratory and genetic findings in a 3.5-year-old Iranian female patient, a product of a consanguineous marriage, who was suspicious of FA, observed with short stature, microcephaly, skin hyperpigmentation, anemia, thrombocytopenia and hypo cellular bone marrow. Therefore, Next Generation Sequencing was performed to identify the genetic cause of the disease in this patient. Results revealed a novel, private, homozygous frameshift mutation in the FANCF gene (NM_022725: c. 534delG, p. G178â€‰fs) which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the proband."
