  "text": "A 82-year-old male presented to the urology department, complaining of frequent urination and dysuria. One giant, dark brown stone (6.5 × 6 × 5.5 cm) was revealed in the diverticulum of the anterior urethra using combination of local ultrasound, pelvic Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The stone was then successfully broken down via the PLCUL, and the emptied anterior urethral diverticulum was left untreated. In the 18 months' follow-up, no new calculus was found in urethral tract, anterior diverticula became gradually smaller, eventually disappeared."
