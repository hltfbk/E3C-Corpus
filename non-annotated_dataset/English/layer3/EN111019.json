  "text": "A 13-year-old Japanese girl presented with left side lumbar pain. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine demonstrated a tumorous lesion in the left side pedicle of L4. Although gross total resection of the mass, including the nidus, was performed in the initial surgery, recurrence was observed repeatedly in the short term and the pathological diagnosis of all of the resected tumors was conventional osteoblastoma. We finally performed carbon ion radiotherapy after the patient's 3rd palliative operation, and achieved a good outcome. No further recurrence has been observed in 10â€‰years of follow-up."
