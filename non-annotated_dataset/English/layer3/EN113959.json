  "text": "After failed conventional management of OCD a patient undergoes intra-articular MSC therapy. Patient outcome measures included the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). Structural outcome was assessed using MRI with the novel technique of T2 mapping used to indicate cartilage quality. Following MSC therapy the patient reported improvement in pain and function as measured by NPRS, WOMAC and KOOS. Repeat MRI analysis showed regeneration of cartilage. MRI T2 mapping indicated hyaline like cartilage regrowth."
