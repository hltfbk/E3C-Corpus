  "text": "A 54-year-old caucasian male with unremarkable medical history presented with worsening of a several-year history of lower-quadrant abdominal pain and nausea. There were no abnormal findings on his physical examination and laboratory workup.\nAn abdominal CT revealed the presence of a soft tissue mass located in the root of the mesentery, 4.7x4.1x5cm, heterogenous with some calcifications within, with thickening of the surrounding fatty tissue, vascular encasement without infiltration of the vessels and lymphadenopathy. The lesion was further characterized by MRI as slightly hyperintense in T2 and hypointense in T1 with peripheral late phase contrast enhancement and \"tumor pseudocapsule\".\nThe patient was admitted for a surgical biopsy. During the surgery, we found a nodular thickening of the ileal mesentery, with apparent inflammation and retraction of the surrounding tissue. No other lesions were apparent. Since the size and location precluded a complete resection of the mass, several biopsies were performed and the fragments were sent for histopathologic review. The biopsy revealed a thickening of the connective tissue with fibrotic areas and lymphoplasmocytary infiltration rich in IgG4-positive plasmocytes. These findings were consistent with sclerosing mesenteritis. Serum IgG4 levels taken post-operatively were within the normal range. The patient was started on Prednisone (50mg a day) and quickly became asymptomatic. He was tapered off steroids after 3 months. Follow-up CTs at 6 and 12 months documented stability of the mesenteric mass."
