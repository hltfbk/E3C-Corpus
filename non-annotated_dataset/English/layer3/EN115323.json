  "text": "We report on a 28-year-old Black Brazilian primigravida who was referred to our maternity hospital, a tertiary care center, for decision about the most adequate mode of delivery. She was admitted with a platelet count of 43.000 plt/μL, and hemoglobin of 13.6 g/dL. Platelet transfusion was regarded as a necessary prophylactic measure prior to delivery. Ten units of random donor platelets were administered on the course of three days, after which the patient was submitted to an elective cesarean section delivery under general anesthesia at 40 weeks of gestational age. A healthy male baby with a normal birthweight of 3.615 kg was delivered. After the delivery, the mother's state continued being assessed daily, with special attention taken to lochia and surgical wound healing. At one week postpartum, a complete blood count revealed a platelet count of 41.000 plt/μL, and hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL. As there were no signs of neither evident nor occult hemorrhage, and surgical wound was healing accordingly, the patient was discharged, after being oriented about bleeding preventive measures."
