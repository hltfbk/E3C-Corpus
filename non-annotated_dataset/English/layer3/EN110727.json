  "text": "We report a case of a 21-year-old gravida 2, para 1, at 25+5 weeks of gestation, who presented to the hospital with severe epigastric pain and decreased fetal movement. Ultrasonography showed intrauterine fetal death, a retroperitoneal mass in the epigastric region, and hemoperitoneum. Computed tomography scan revealed a heterogeneously enhancing pancreatic mass suggestive of pancreatic neoplasm. However, the late diagnosis and the delay in treatment resulted in a deterioration of maternal status with eventual mortality."
