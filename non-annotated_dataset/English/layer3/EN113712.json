  "text": "In the present work, we analyze one case of ITPN associated with an invasive component and discuss the results involving the current literature. Collected patient data included medical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, radiological imaging, reports of interventions and operation, and histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. The patient initially presented with acute pancreatitis. A solid tumor obstructing the main pancreatic duct and sticking out of the papilla of Vater was detected and caught via endoscopic intervention. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed mainly tubular growth pattern with back to back tubular glands. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was strongly positive for keratin 7 (CK7) and pankeratin AE1/AE3, and alpha 1 antichymotrypsin; negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin A, CDx2, CK20, S100, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), MUC 2, MUC5AC, and somatostatin; and in part positive for CA19-9. Extended pancreatoduodenectomy was performed, the final diagnosis was tubulopapillary carcinoma grown in an ITPN."
