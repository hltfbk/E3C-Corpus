  "text": "An 18-year-old male presented with hemoptysis and respiratory distress requiring orotracheal intubation. Laboratory tests showed positive anti-nuclear antibody and anti-dsDNA and low C3 and C4. Bronchoalveolar lavage became progressively hemorrhagic after each aliquot. He was treated with pulse methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchanges."
