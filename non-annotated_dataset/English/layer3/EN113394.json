  "text": "A 71-year-old Japanese man with anorexia was referred to us for the treatment of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Computed tomography revealed a pancreatic head tumor with a calculus, associated with the dilatation of the main pancreatic duct and intrahepatic bile duct. Three-dimensional imaging demonstrated focal narrowing in the proximal celiac axis due to median arcuate ligament compression and a prominent gastroduodenal artery that fed the common hepatic artery. The preoperative diagnosis was alcoholic chronic pancreatitis with common bile duct obstruction and celiac axis stenosis due to median arcuate ligament compression. Pancreaticoduodenectomy with median arcuate ligament release was scheduled. Before the division of the median arcuate ligament, the peak flow velocity and resistive index of his intrahepatic artery measured with Doppler ultrasonography decreased from 37.7 cm/second and 0.510, respectively, to 20.6 cm/second and 0.508 respectively, when his gastroduodenal artery was clamped. However, these values returned to baseline levels after the division of the median arcuate ligament. These findings suggested that pancreaticoduodenectomy could be performed safely. Our patient was discharged on postoperative day 17 without significant complications."
