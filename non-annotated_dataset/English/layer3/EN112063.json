  "text": "A 21-month-old male with G6PD deficiency presented to the emergency department three hours following an exploratory ingestion of a naphthalene-containing mothball. On arrival, the patient was tachycardic with normal blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Initial laboratory studies showed significant anemia with elevated reticulocyte count, blood urea nitrogen, total bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase. Haptoglobin level was low, and the methemoglobin level was unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and underwent blood transfusion."
