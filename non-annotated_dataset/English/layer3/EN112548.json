  "text": "A 12â€‰year-old female presented with iron deficient anemia developed gastric perforation. Emergency laparoscopic repair of the perforation was performed and tissue pathology showed gastric MALT lymphoma infiltration. Helicobacter pylori eradication and radiotherapy were sequentially performed. Complete remission was achieved at two months after radiotherapy. To our best knowledge, she is the youngest patient with gastric MALT lymphoma reported in the literature."
