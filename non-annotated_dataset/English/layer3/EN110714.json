  "text": "This paper reports a rare case of dental focal infection-induced ventricular and spinal canal empyema. During the course of treatment at a local hospital, the patient had negative results from repeated CSF bacterial cultures and was empirically given vancomycin treatment. After transfer to our hospital, the next-generation sequencing technique was adopted to determine that the pathogenic microorganisms were multiple anaerobic infectious bacteria derived from the oral cavity. The antibiotic therapeutic scheme was adjusted in a timely manner, and the ventricular and spinal canal inflammation was also controlled. However, the antibiotics that had been applied at the local hospital were not able to cover all pathogenic microorganisms, which resulted in irreversible injury to the brain stem, finally leading to patient death."
