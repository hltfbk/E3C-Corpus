  "text": "A 31-year-old Japanese man, who had been treated with infliximab infusions for Crohn's disease, was referred to our hospital presenting with an abrupt onset of high fever and an elevated white blood cell count and serum C-reactive protein level. Computed tomography revealed a liver abscess occupying segment 8. The limited effect of percutaneous transhepatic abscess drainage and antibiotics led us to perform radical resection of the abscess. The patient recovered quickly after surgery and the postoperative course was uneventful."
