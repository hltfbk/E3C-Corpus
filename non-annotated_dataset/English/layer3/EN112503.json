  "text": "This case report describes detailed 7-year follow-up of a patient with venlafaxine-induced DB treated with an occlusal splint. The patient who complained about involuntary daytime tooth grinding after taking venlafaxine for a period of 4 mo and was diagnosed with venlafaxine-induced DB. Subsequently, an occlusal splint with modified bilateral buccal-pterygoid pads was used to treat his tooth grinding and to protect the dental structures from tooth wearing. The patient reported remission of symptoms after several months of treatment. His grinding activity was gradually and stably controlled after 2 years, with an almost complete recovery from DB after 6 years."
