  "text": "Both Emirati patients described satisfied the diagnostic criteria for mixed connective tissue disease (systemic lupus predominant) and systemic lupus erythematous. Other differential diagnoses of myocarditis were excluded. The patients were started on pulsed steroid followed by oral steroid, with hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil, and anti-heart failure medications used as needed. Dramatic responses were noted in the first few weeks in terms of symptoms."
