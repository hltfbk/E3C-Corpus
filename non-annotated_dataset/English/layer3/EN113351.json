  "text": "A 59-year-old Japanese patient with multiple pulmonary cysts and pneumothorax was hospitalized due to dyspnea. BHD was suspected and genetic testing was performed. The patient exhibited the splice-site mutation of FLCN in the 5' end of intron 9 (c.1062 + 1G > A). Total mRNA was extracted from pulmonary cysts, and RT-PCR assessment and sequence analyses were done. Two distinct bands were generated; one was wild-type and the other was a larger-sized mutant. Sequence analysis of the latter transcript revealed the insertion of 130 base pairs of intron 9 from the beginning of the splice-site between exons 9 and 10."
