  "text": "This paper describes carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in a 15-year-old child who suffered from severe cardiopulmonary compromise without overt neuropsychiatric sequelae. This occurred after he was exposed to a home heater producing high levels of carbon monoxide for an estimated six to eight hours. CO-induced cardiopulmonary compromise is infrequent in children."
