  "text": "A 36-year-old man diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome was reffered to our center with frequent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) discharges. ICD interrogation showed several appropriate ICD intervention for tachycardia detected in the ventricular fibrillation zone. Unfortunately, quinidine was not available in our country at the time of admission; therefore, we decided to ablate suspicious arrhythmogenic substrates. Programmed ventricular stimulation from right ventricle (RV) reproducibly induced a sustained ventricular tachycardia with left bundle branch block morphology and inferior axis. RV outflow tract (RVOT) endocardially mapped and earliest activation signal (90 milliseconds) achieved at posterior aspect of the RVOT septum. RF energy application at that site terminated the tachycardia and no inducible tachycardia was detected. During two-year follow-up, he had no episodes of ICD therapy and remained symptom-free with any antiarrhythmic drug."
