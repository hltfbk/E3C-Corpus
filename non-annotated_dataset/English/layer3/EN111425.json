  "text": "A 77-year-old woman, with a history of bilateral renal calculus for 15 years, was admitted to the Department of Urology of our hospital complaining of recurrent painless gross hematuria for one month. The treatment with cephalosporin was ineffective. Computed tomography imaging showed a mixed density and slightly heterogeneously enhanced lesion in the middle pole of the left kidney and ipsilateral adrenal enlargement. The patient underwent surgical treatment by retroperitoneoscopic left radical nephrectomy plus adrenalectomy. A large number of typical spindle cells surrounded by plasma cells and lymphocytes were observed microscopically. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that these spindle cells were positive for vimentin, cytokeratin (CK), Ki-67, CK7, CD34, and CD31 and were focally positive for CD10 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK-1). Thus, a diagnosis of IMT was made definitively. The patient recovered well after operation, and no recurrence or metastasis was noted during the 22-mo follow-up."
