  "text": "Case 1: a 71-year-old male with metastatic CRPC presented with convulsive seizures two weeks after receiving abiraterone plus prednisone. The serum potassium level was 2.1mEq/l. We determined that convulsive seizure was caused by hypokalemia associated with abiraterone. Case 2: a 68-year-old male with metastatic CRPC presented with severe lethargy one month after receiving abiraterone plus prednisone. The serum potassium level was 1.7mEq/l and we concluded that severe lethargy was caused by hypokalemia associated with abiraterone. They were treated with potassium supplementation and increased prednisone following withdrawal of abiraterone."
