  "text": "We report a 21-year-old Han Chinese man who presented with limb weakness and unsteady gait, which progressed rapidly over a period of months until he was wheelchair-bound. He subsequently developed ESRD and was commenced on hemodialysis. Investigations revealed a m.13513G > A mutation with clinical and radiological features consistent with LS. His mitochondrial disease stabilised and he underwent a multidisciplinary assessment for deceased donor kidney transplantation to identify and minimise the LS-associated perioperative risks and potential negative effects of immunosuppressants on his LS. Successful kidney transplantation followed with excellent graft function three and a half years post-transplant and improvement in the patient's physical function."
