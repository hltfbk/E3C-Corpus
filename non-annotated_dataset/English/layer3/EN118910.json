  "text": "We present three cases of fibroepithelial polyps associated with calculi in the distal part of the ureter. The patients were all women, aged 20, 45 and 52 years. Two patients were suffering from flank pain and dysuria while one patient was asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. The patients were fully treated with endoscopic resection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fourth report of adult ureteral fibroepithelial polyps associated with ureteral calculi in the English literature. The etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of fibroepithelial polyps are discussed in this report."
