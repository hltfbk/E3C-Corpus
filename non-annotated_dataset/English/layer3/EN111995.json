  "text": "A 45-year-old man had undergone a thoracic epidural catheter insertion for perioperative analgesia prior to general anesthesia induction. Due to intermittent dripping of fluid while the epidural needle was being advanced, a dural puncture was suspected. The patient complained of an orthostatic headache after recovery from surgery, therefore a PDPH was suspected. MR images revealed signs of SIH: dural sinus engorgement, contrast enhancement along the neural sleeves of the left C6-7, bilateral C7-T1, T1-2, T2-3, T3-4, T4-5, and T5-6. Computed tomography-guided epidural blood patching (EBP) was performed the following day, with the patient experiencing immediate relief of the headache."
