  "text": "A 62-year-old man presented with complaints of haemoptysis, polyuria, polydipsia, increased appetite, weight loss, and pigmentation. Following a series of laboratory and imaging examinations, he was diagnosed with SCLC, EAS, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, and central diabetes insipidus. After three rounds of chemotherapy, levels of ACTH, cortisol, thyroid hormone, gonadal hormone, and urine volume had returned to normal levels. In addition, the pulmonary tumor was reduced in size."
