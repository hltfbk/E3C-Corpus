  "text": "A 56-year-old Caucasian male with a 6-year diagnosis of PD who was being treated with high dose carbidopa-levodopa and left DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) presented after a suicide attempt. The patient was found to be severely depressed and had exhibited behavioral changes in the weeks leading up to the attempt. Imaging was performed to assess positional changes of DBS and carbidopa-levodopa dosage adjusted while under close observation in the inpatient unit. The patient was started on fluoxetine to treat the depressive symptoms and was eventually discharged with close monitoring."
