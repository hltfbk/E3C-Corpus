  "text": "The symptoms and clinical course of acute poisoning with carbon monoxide in a 7-year-old boy are described. To evaluate the possible causes, a brain computed tomography (CT) was performed that showed thick clot in the left medial temporal and parasellar area, left sylvian fissure (acute intravascular thrombus) accompanied by left diffuse frontotemporal hypodensity and midline shift. Four-vessel digital subtraction angiography two weeks after intoxication was not indicative of any vascular lesion."
