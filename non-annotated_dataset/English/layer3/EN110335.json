  "text": "Case 1: a 50-year-old woman was complaining of postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Her medical history revealed that she was diagnosed with breast carcinoma 2 years ago. At that time she enderwent a radical mastectomy associated with axillary lymph node dissection pathological examination of the tumor revealed invasive lobular breast carcinoma; stage IIb (T2 N1 M0). Immunohistochemical staining showed strongly positive for estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR), negative for cerbB2. After surgery, she received adjuvant chemotherapy and left breast radiation. Since the tumor showed strongly positive estrogen receptors expression,we decided to put her under endocrine therapy treatment for 5 years. However, during the 23 th month of tamoxifen, she presented with postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Gynecologic examination was normal, pelvic ultrasound revealed that the endometrial thickeness was 13mm. Endometrial biopsy confirmed metastasis to the endometrium, from lobular breast carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed tumor infiltration of the myometrium less than 50% (stage IA as classified by FIGO 2009). She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Breast carcinoma metastases in endometrium and myometrium were confirmed histopathologically and immunohistochemically.\nCase 2: a 67-year-old woman was complaining of postmenopausal uterine bleeding. She has a medical history of hypertension and she is undergoing an hematologic exploration of bicytopenia. She was also diagnosed with bilateral breast carcinoma 3 years ago. She underwent a routine scintigraphy which revealed a single bony metastases on the spine treated with radiotherapy. At that time she underwent a left radical mastectomy and a right concervative breast cancer treatement (tumerectomy) associated with bilateral axillary lymph node dissection.Pathology was consistent with a multifocal infiltrating ductal carcinoma with 15 metastatic lymphnodes out of 16 at the left breast and an infiltrating ductal carcinoma measuring 1.5cm with no positif lymphnodes out of 15 at the left breast, ER/PR + and Her-2 Neu+. After surgery, she received adjuvant chemotherapy and bilateral breast radiation. Since the tumor showed strongly positive hormone receptors expression,we decided to put her under endocrine therapy treatment for 5 years. However, after 3 years, she presented with postmenopausal uterine bleeding. Gynecologic examination was normal, pelvic ultrasound revealed that the endometrial thickeness was 21mm. Endometrial biopsy confirmed metastasis to the endometrium, from lobular breast carcinoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed stage Ib cancer as classified by FIGO 2009. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Breast carcinoma metastases in endometrium and myometrium were confirmed histopathologically and immunohistochemically."
