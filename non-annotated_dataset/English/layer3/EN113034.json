  "text": "A 55-year-old woman complained of rectorrhagia and intermittent abdominal pain. A neoplasm was revealed by colonoscopy, CT scan and F18-FDG PET/CT of the recto-sigmoidal colon. The patient underwent a rectal anterior resection, hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for treatment. According to the histological and immunohistochemical presentation, the diagnosis of endometriosis-associated recto-sigmoid cancer was confirmed. The patient was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for 6 months. During the follow-up appointment 22 months later, there was clinical and radiographic evidence of recurrence in the rectum. The patient received chemotherapy again and will receive another surgery after two more cycles of chemotherapy."
