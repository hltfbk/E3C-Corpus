  "text": "We extensively analyze a giant submandibular mixed tumor of 25-year evolution in a 57-year-old Caucasian woman. Deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy was evaluated in different superficial and deep areas using flow cytometry analysis and correlated with pathological and immunohistochemical characteristics. Superficial areas exhibited a typical histological pleomorphic adenoma pattern and were deoxyribonucleic acid diploid. Deep samples showed deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploidy, atypical histological benign features and expression of markers involved at an early-stage of malignant transformation, such as tumor protein 53 and antigen Ki67."
