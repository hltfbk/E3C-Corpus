  "text": "A 28-year-old East Asian man presented at our hospital with painless bilateral scrotal swelling. Both scrotal ultrasonography and computed tomography findings showed bilateral testicular tumors, and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a lack of enhancement in his right testis, indicating a hemorrhagic infarction and a left testicular tumor. After a bilateral orchiectomy, the intraoperative and histopathological findings revealed a left seminoma with a complicating contralateral testicular torsion that had developed with hemorrhagic infarction."
