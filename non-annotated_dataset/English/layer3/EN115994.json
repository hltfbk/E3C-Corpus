  "text": "Here we report a case of a 54-year-old female with multiple neurofibromatosis who presented with features of obstructed defecation and was found to have a large perineal hernia. At surgery, we found an unusual herniation of a large neuropathic bladder and rectum through a perineal defect. She underwent reduction cystoplasty and repair of the pelvic floor using a prolene mesh. Subsequent histopathological examination confirmed a large neurofibroma infiltrating the urinary bladder."
