  "text": "We describe a case of a Caucasian male infant with prenatally diagnosed lower urinary tract obstruction and secondary pulmonary hypoplasia who was delivered spontaneously at 36 + 2 weeks of gestation. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was initiated on the first day of life for severe respiratory failure and consecutive hypoxemia despite treatment with inhaled nitric oxide and high-frequency oscillation. The patient was supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 10 days and extubated 6 weeks later. Hemofiltration was required on the second day of life because of renal insufficiency and was later replaced by peritoneal dialysis. The child was discharged after 4 months with nasal high-flow mild oxygen therapy and peritoneal dialysis."
