  "text": "We bring into discussion a case of a 47-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a painful right-sided groin lump for the past 2Â days. After initial resuscitation, a CT scan was requested which showed the presence of inflamed appendix inside the femoral canal. She was taken to the operative theatre, and during the laparoscopy, the appendix was identified migrating through the femoral canal and it could not be retracted into the peritoneal cavity; therefore, the mesoappendix was divided and the operation converted to the open low approach. After identifying the femoral hernia sac and opening it, the appendix was removed and herniorrhaphy was performed. Our patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the following day."
