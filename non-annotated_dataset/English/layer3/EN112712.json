  "text": "A 70-year-old Caucasian male who initially presented in the emergency room due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding was subsequently found to have a submucosal nodule at gastroesophageal junction. A diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was rendered on biopsy. Histologic examination of the subsequent endoscopic mucosal resection revealed an adenocarcinoma with various levels of differentiation which are zonally distributed. The deeper portion of the tumor showed well-differentiated bland-appearing glands with extensive cystic and secretory changes. The cytoplasm of tumor cells and secretion demonstrated marked reactivity with lysozyme antibody on immunohistochemical stain. The tumor had a peculiar Her2/neu staining pattern with cytoplasmic and nuclear stain in poorly-differentiated area and no stain in well-differentiated area. Only membranous stain was detected with beta-catenin antibody."
