  "text": "A 47-year-old man came with a sudden onset of foot pain including drop foot to our department. We diagnosed a TAT rupture, which was fixed through suture. The pathologist testified degenerative changes in the tendon. In addition, a CNC was diagnosed. No extra treatment was necessary for the CNC. At the 6-year follow-up examination, the patient had no pain and went back to normal day activities (AOFAS 95/100 points)."
