  "text": "A 12-year-old Arabian mare was admitted to Sharjah Equine Hospital with a history of right eye ulcerative keratitis of unknown duration. Following a week of aggressive medical treatment, the condition deteriorated and a keratectomy and pedicle conjunctival graft were performed. A week later, the conjunctival graft partially dehisced and the ulcer continued to degrade.In attempting to preserve the integrity of the globe a second grafting procedure was performed when a segment of fascia lata harvested from the ipsilateral hind leg was grafted onto the corneal lesion.Response to surgery was positive and the mare was discharged from the hospital on Day 31 post diagnosis (17â€‰days after the second surgery) with a comfortable eye.Follow-up12 months later revealed a comfortable but only partially visual eye due to corneal scarring."
