  "text": "In this paper, we present two cases of young patients with PUs located in their tongue, which is very rare and easily misdiagnosed in clinical work. Both two young patients complained of an itchy tongue and cannot help biting their tongue. These two cases were worth reporting because it was rare that PUs was the initial symptom and located in the tongue. The results indicated that PUs seem to play an important role in the generation of tics."
