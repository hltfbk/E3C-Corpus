  "text": "A 32-year-old female patient was admitted to hospital with bilateral, symmetrical, painless swelling of the lacrimal, submandibular glands, with no history of dry eyes or mouth. The symptoms appeared since the first pregnancy and lasted for a period of longer than 3 years. Although she attended medical check-ups several times, she did not receive any definitive diagnosis or treatment. Imaging findings: on ultrasound examination of the patient's orbit and neck, the diffuse enlargement of the lacrimal and submandibular glands was observed, in addition to hypervascularity and multiple hypoechoic areas. Facial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the diffuse enlargement of the lacrimal and submandibular glands, without evidence of focal lesion or nodularity. The glands were hypointense on T2 signal with marked enhancement. No inflammatory stranding or infiltration was observed surrounding the glands. No evidence of sialolithiasis or dilatation of the parotid duct was detected. Pathology: the patient underwent a biopsy of the lacrimal gland. The microscopic images showed lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrotic areas. The immunohistochemical findings revealed CD138-positive cells and the absence of malignant cells. Immunostaining results demonstrated that there were remarkably increases of IgG and IgG4 positive plasma cells with the IgG4 positive plasma cells > 50/ high-power field. Serum IgG4: serum IgG4 levels were as high as 5,012 mg/L before the administration of steroid therapy, compared with the normal range of less than 1,350 mg/L [7]. Treatment: the patient was treated with 40 mg/day prednisolone for 4 weeks, after which the dose decreased by 5 mg/week until it reached 5 mg/day. After 9 months of treatment with corticoids, the serum IgG4 level was markedly decreased, returning to within the normal range, at 798 mg/L, accompanied by decreased gland sizes."
