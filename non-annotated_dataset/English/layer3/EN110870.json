  "text": "A 59-year-old European male patient suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy with severely reduced left ventricular function and presenting with NYHA III underwent cardiac transplantation in 2004. At the one-year follow-up, during routine cardiac catheterization, two stents were found, one in the right coronary artery and one in the circumflex artery, in the patient's transplanted heart. As no stent implantation was performed since transplantation, these were present prior to transplantation and had been transplanted without causing clinical signs. One of the stents showed in-stent restenosis, and the patient received an additional stent 7â€‰years after transplantation. The other stent still showed a good result, and no further intervention has been required so far. The patient is currently in good clinical condition."
