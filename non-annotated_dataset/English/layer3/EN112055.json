  "text": "A 44-year-old man had a history of multi-joint swelling and pain for more than half a year. His laboratory data with double positive for rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated protein antibodies further supported the diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis. His previous medical history including progressive hearing loss for several years and microhematuria for one year attracted our attention. Renal biopsy showed thin basement membrane nephropathy and lymphocytes infiltration of interstitium. To make a precise diagnosis, targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of an inherited renal disease panel including Alport syndrome genes was performed, which revealed the missense mutation in COL4A5 (c.1351 T > C, p.Cys451Arg). Further in silico analyses predicted that the p. Cys451Arg mutation is functionally \"damaging\", so the diagnosis of Alport syndrome was finally proved. The patient has been receiving the treatment of total glucosides of paeony and leflunomide for rheumatoid arthritis, and Cozaar 50 mg for the protection of kidney so far. During the 10-months follow-up, swelling and tenderness of the joints in this patient had been generally relieved, with no obvious improvement in microhematuria and a slight increase in proteinuria."
