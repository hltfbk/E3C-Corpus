  "text": "The patient is a previously healthy 35-year-old Caucasian man. His symptoms began four years ago when he suddenly felt weakness in his legs and started sweating for unknown reasons. The symptoms worsened, and laboratory tests revealed hypoglycemia and hyperinsulinemia at the time of the symptoms. All diagnostics attempts using magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and endoscopic ultrasound did not reveal any abnormalities. At this stage, surgical intervention was planned, and a distal 80% pancreatectomy was performed. The histopathologic and immunohistochemical investigations of the pancreas showed an increased number of islets of different sizes, more or less evenly distributed in the gland, but no insulinoma. Patch-clamp recordings from isolated pancreatic β-cells showed that, even at a low glucose concentration (3 mmol/L), the β-cell membrane was depolarized, and action potentials were seen. Surprisingly, in patch-clamp experiments, the addition of diazoxide had a marked effect on K-ATP channel activity and membrane potential, but no effect on insulin levels in vivo before surgery."
