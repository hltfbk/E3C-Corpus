  "text": "A 55-year-old man, who had no family or past history of mitochondrial disorders, suddenly developed bilateral visual field constriction and repeated stroke-like episodes. He ultimately presented with cortical blindness, recurrent epilepsy and severe cognitive impairment approximately 6 months after the first episode. Genetic analysis of biopsied biceps brachii muscle, but not of peripheral white blood cells, revealed a T10158C mutation in the mtDNA-encoded gene of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3), which has previously been thought to be associated with severe or fatal mitochondrial disorders that develop during the neonatal period or in infancy."
