  "text": "Our patient is a 16-month-old Hispanic girl with extreme developmental delay, microcephaly, large ears, short and thick upper lip, broad philtrum, widely spaced teeth, constipation, dysphagia, fat pads on feet and hands, autistic behavior and seizure-like episodes. She had a normal karyotype (46,XX), and array testing showed greater than 8 % homozygosity with otherwise normal results. Genes within these areas of homozygosity may provide clues to an etiology and suggest autosomal recessive inheritance. This case report highlights the possibility of ethnic variations in this syndrome's presentation, which may have ramifications in uncovering the pathogenesis as well as expanding the phenotype."
