  "text": "A 74-year-old woman presented with postmenopausal bleeding and acute blood loss requiring transfusion. She was found to have a rapidly enlarging uterine mass clinically suspicious for sarcoma. An abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. A 15.5 cm partially necrotic intramural mass was identified in the uterine corpus. The tumor was classified as a cellular leiomyoma. RNA sequencing identified a KAT6B-KANSL1 fusion that was confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. After 6 months of follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic without evidence of disease."
