  "text": "A previously healthy woman presented with recurrent postprandial vomiting, epigastric discomfort, and unintentional weight loss over 6â€‰months. She had no diarrhea or extraintestinal manifestations. Clinically, she was pale and dehydrated. Examination of systems was unremarkable except for mild epigastric tenderness. Her initial laboratory findings were normocytic normochromic anemia, high inflammatory markers, and hypokalemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed an inflamed pyloric mucosa with features of pyloric obstruction. Furthermore, magnetic resonance enterography confirmed the pyloric stenosis. Histopathological examination of a biopsy from the pylorus revealed noncaseating granuloma with superficial ulceration. Tuberculosis and sarcoidosis were excluded by appropriate investigations, and a diagnosis of gastric Crohn's disease was made. Following the initial resuscitation, intralesional steroid injection and controlled radial expansion balloon dilation of the pylorus were carried out. The patient was commenced on azathioprine as a maintenance treatment, which led to a successful dilation and remarkable symptom improvement."
