  "text": "A 37 year old Malaysian Chinese parturient was admitted at 25 weeks gestation following a scan which suggested intrauterine death and placenta accreta. She was diagnosed to have congenital complete heart block after her first delivery eight years previously but a pacemaker was never inserted. These medical conditions make her extremely likely to experience massive bleeding and haemodynamic instability. Among the measures taken to optimise her pre-operatively were the insertion of a temporary intravenous pacemaker and embolization of the uterine arteries to minimize peri-operative blood loss. She successfully underwent surgery under general anesthesia, which was relatively uneventful and was discharged well on the fourth post-operative day."
