  "text": "A 23-year-old Caucasian man with keratoconus cornea stage 1 to 2 underwent uneventful corneal collagen cross-linking treatment according to the Dresden protocol. The next day the patient had intense photophobia, watering and redness of the eye, and his visual acuity was limited to counting fingers. Slit lamp biomicroscopy revealed severe corneal haze accompanied by non-specific endothelial precipitates following an acute inflammatory response. Mild inflammation could be detected in the anterior chamber. Moreover, the re-epithelialization process could barely be detected. His corneal state gradually deteriorated, resulting in descemetocele and finally perforation."
