  "text": "Herein, we reported a case of long-term survival following a combination of hepatectomy for a liver metastasis and radiation and chemotherapy for abdominal lymph node metastases after a curative pancreaticoduodenectomy for PC. A 51-year-old Japanese man underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy following a PC diagnosis in December 2011. After the surgery, the patient received 16 cycles of gemcitabine (GEM) adjuvant chemotherapy. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) after therapy with GEM (17 months after surgery) revealed a 1-cm nodule in the liver, for which the patient underwent partial hepatectomy in May 2013. Approximately 1 month after the hepatectomy, the patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy using tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (S-1) for 12 months. Approximately 1 year after the second surgery, an abdominal CT scan detected the abdominal lymph node metastases, for which the patient underwent radiation therapy. After the radiation therapy, combination therapy with 5-fluorouracil(5-FU)/leucovorin plus oxaliplatin or irinotecan was started in September 2014; 59 cycles of this chemotherapy have been administered up to the time of this report. At 67 months after the pancreaticoduodenectomy and 50 months after the hepatectomy, the patient has remained healthy with no relapse or recurrent lesions."
