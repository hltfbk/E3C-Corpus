  "text": "A 41-year-old male experienced a traumatic cyclodialysis cleft, which resulted in persistent hypotony. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed to treat vitreous hemorrhage. Scleral indentation was attempted to visualize the cyclodialysis cleft. However, the depression distorted the visualization. Intraocular endoscopy was therefore used to evaluate the cleft. Guided by this assessment, only intraocular gas tamponade was used to reposition the ciliary body. The patient's intraocular pressure was restored to 13â€‰mmHg 3 days after the operation, and OCT confirmed cleft closure 1 month after the operation."
