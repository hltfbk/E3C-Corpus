  "text": "A 51-year-old CaucasianÂ woman presented to our out-patients' clinic with a 2-week history of worsening abdominal pain in her left upper quadrant, exacerbated by abdominal flexion and extension maneuvers. Here we describe a case involving gastric penetration and subsequent downward migration of a band into distal jejunum causing small bowel obstruction, which occurred more than 10 years following initial diagnosis of erosion. The perforation was missed due to cessation of endoscopic follow-up."
