  "text": "A 16-year-old female was referred to our surgical clinic with abdominal pain and vomiting of one year duration. Her personal history revealed trichophagia and onychophagia. Clinical examination revealed a malnourished girl, with a mobile well-defined mass occupying the upper half of the abdomen. The mass was not tender and was firm in consistency. There was also evidence of paleness of mucosa and skin.\nLaboratory test results showed a leukocytosis of 6100/mm, hypochromic microcytic anemia (hemoglobin, 8.2 g/dL), hypoproteinemia (43 g/L) and hypocholesterolemia (1.45 g/L); with normal liver chemistries and lipase.\nThe computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a huge gastric distention with well-circumscribed and heterogeneous mass occupying the whole stomach cavity with extension into the third portion of the duodenum. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy pull only few fibers of hair to comfort the diagnostic. The patient underwent surgery, and through upper midline incision, an antral gastrotomy was done. A giant trichobezoar was identified and was removed. There was a long tail of hair extending through the pylorus into the proximal jejunum, the spacemen takes the shape of the stomach and duodenum. By this feature the diagnosis was clear of a Rapunzel syndrome. The gastrotomy was closed with continuous Vicryl 3-0.\nThe patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged after 5 days. The patient was also referred to psychiatric follow-up."
