  "text": "We report the case of an 18-year-old Romanian man with short stature, external ophthalmoplegia, palpebral ptosis, myopathy, sensorineural hearing impairment, cerebellar ataxia, cardiac conduction defect, diabetes mellitus, hypoparathyroidism and hyperaldosteronism. The patient's evolution showed progressive insufficiency of the renal tubule: hyperphosphaturia, hyperaminoaciduria and, later, glucosuria (de Toni-Debr√©-Fanconi syndrome), a syndrome, to date, rarely diagnosed in association with complete Kearns-Sayre syndrome. The final diagnosis was delayed for several years and was only established when he developed diabetes mellitus. Southern blot analysis and polymerase chain reaction amplification revealed the presence of a deletion in the mitochondrial DNA."
