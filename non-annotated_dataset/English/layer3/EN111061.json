  "text": "The patient here described is a young boy, who fulfilled the clinical diagnostic criteria for both syndromes. He had a complex clinical history with caf√©-au-lait macules, axillary and inguinal freckling, multiple non-ossifying fibromas, giant-cell granuloma of the jaw, neurofibromas, plexiform fibroma, ocular Lisch nodules, optic chiasmatic- hypothalamic glioma, pseudarthrosis, scoliosis, short stature, vascular anomalies, seizures. Molecular analysis of the NF1 gene both on blood cells and non-ossifying fibroma's biopsy tissue allowed the detection of a novel variant within the coding region, NM_000267.3:c.2789_2791delATC(p.Tyr930_Pro931delinsSer), with loss of heterozygosity (second hit mutation) in the non-ossifying fibroma."
