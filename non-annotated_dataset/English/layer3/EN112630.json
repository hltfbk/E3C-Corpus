  "text": "We present here two rare clinical cases treated in our hospital. Two women (68 and 76 years old) with peri-implant (cephalomedullary nail) fractures and history of prolonged bisphosphonate use (11 and 14 years). Both fractures occurred after minor trauma and showed an atypical fracture pattern. One of the patients underwent revision osteosynthesis and had a 12 months follow-up. The second patient was submitted to orthopedic treatment and had a 6months follow-up."
