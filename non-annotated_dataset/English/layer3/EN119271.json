  "text": "We present a 42-year old male who experienced a unilateral left quadriceps tendon rupture following assault by four people. Twenty-seven years before this injury, the patient had suffered ipsilateral femur and comminuted patellar fractures, which were managed by intramedullary nailing and patellectomy respectively. We performed primary end to end repair of the torn tendon. Postoperatively, histology revealed findings consistent with pre-existent degenerative changes. The patient made good recovery, and returned to his former occupation which was reliant on his ability to drive."
