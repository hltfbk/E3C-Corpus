  "text": "A 71-year-old caucasian male with a known benign esophagus stenosis was referred to the ICU. On arrival an asystole developed which proved to be due to a large pericardial effusion. Pericardial fluids were drained, but the patients' condition worsened and he died due to multiple organ failure. Postmortum investigation revealed an esophago-pericardial fistula."
