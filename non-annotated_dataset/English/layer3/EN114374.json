  "text": "A 20-year-old woman with duodenal adenocarcinoma underwent PSTD. On postoperative day one, she complained of severe abdominal pains. Her serum amylase and serum pancreatic amylase levels were extremely elevated (Amy, 1296 IU/L; P-Amy, 1273 IU/L). With contrast enhanced CT, acute obstructive pancreatitis with pancreas divisum due to the ligation of the dorsal pancreatic duct was highly suspected. An emergency operation was performed to relieve the pancreatic duct obstruction, and an additional anastomosis between the dorsal pancreatic duct and jejunum was performed. The patient's postoperative course was mostly uneventful, and her discomfort improved immediately."
