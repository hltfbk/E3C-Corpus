  "text": "A 51-year-old Japanese woman consulted the emergency room complaining of the sudden onset of anterior chest pain while shopping. We initially suspected her disease as left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome based on her clinical background and laboratory examinations. However, the initial coronary angiogram demonstrated diffuse lesions in her distal left anterior descending coronary artery, and she was finally diagnosed with apical myocardial infarction. The blood flow in her distal left anterior descending coronary artery had markedly improved in the chronic phase. If the reduced blood flow in her distal left anterior descending coronary artery was induced by coronary vasospasm and the vasospasm was relieved before the coronary angiogram was performed, this case must be diagnosed as left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome."
