  "text": "This case report presents an invisible orthodontic treatment of a 24-year-old adult female patient with skeletal Class III relationship, anterior crossbite, proclined upper incisors, and reduced incisor showing. Patients denied extraction and interproximal reduction. With multi-slotted lingual brackets and straight archwires, we applied lingual crown torque to upper anterior teeth to reduce axial proclination. The resulting uprighted position of upper incisors led to increased incisor showing. A good smile and stable occlusion were obtained after 15 months of active treatment."
