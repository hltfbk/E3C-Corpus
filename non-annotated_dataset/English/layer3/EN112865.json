  "text": "A 23-year-old woman with late-onset OTCD diagnosed by biochemical testing was subjected to subsequent genetic testing. Sanger sequencing revealed no pathogenic mutation throughout the coding exons of the OTC gene, but multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) revealed duplication of exons 1-6. Further genetic analyses revealed an inversion of duplicated exon 1 and a tandem duplication of exons 2-6. Each of the junctions of the inversion harbored a microhomology and non-templated microinsertion, respectively, suggesting a replication-based mechanism. The duplication was also of de novo origin but segregation analysis indicated that it took place in the paternal chromosome."
