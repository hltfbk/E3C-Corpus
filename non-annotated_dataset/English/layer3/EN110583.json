  "text": "We present the case of a 40-year-old female patient who suffered from life-threatening hemoptysis and paraplegia due to choriocarcinoma with pulmonary, hepatic and spinal metastases. The patient successfully recovered after multidisciplinary treatment consisting of 21 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation of multiple hepatic metastases, intensity-modulated radiation therapy for spinal metastases and routine physiotherapy. To our knowledge, it is the first reported case of recovery from pulmonary, hepatic and spinal metastases of choriocarcinoma with no specific primary site. Moreover, this is the first reported clinical attempt on 5-d actinomycin D as primary chemotherapy in ultrahigh-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia."
