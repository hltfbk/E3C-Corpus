  "text": "A 59-year-old Caucasian man presented with acute right iliac fossa pain with localized peritonism. At surgery, he was found to have a perforated and haemorrhagic Meckel's diverticulum, associated with a gastrointestinal stromal tumour within the apex of the diverticulum. The absence of necrosis and a low mitotic rate indicated primary resection with subsequent computed tomography surveillance to be the most appropriate management strategy."
