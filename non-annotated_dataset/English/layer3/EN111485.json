  "text": "Two patients developed acute low back pain with mild asymmetric paraparesis, loss of perianal sensation and sphincter dysfunction. Ankle deep tendon reflexes were reduced in bilaterally. Neither patient had cardiovascular risk factors. Magnetic Resonance imaging showed infarction in the conus medullaris. Functional recovery was good in both patients, but progressive asymmetric calf wasting and sphincter dysfunction remained. EMG studies at follow-up of at least 3â€‰years demonstrate active denervation at the muscles innervated by the first sacrum anterior horn cells."
