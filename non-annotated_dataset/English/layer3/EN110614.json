  "text": "A 47-year-old man was admitted in The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University with a 7-year history of progressive hearing loss and near 6-month repeated attacks of headache. Preoperative CT revealed a massive intracranial lesion and associated hydrocephalus. MR scanning demonstrated a 7.2 cm × 4.6 cm × 4.2 cm bulky mass located in left-sided posterior cranial fossa and temporo-occipital region which showed hyperintensity on T1-weighted images and mixed signal intensity on T2-weighted images. There was no neither clinical manifestation nor family history of Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL).Due to the mass that was large and invading the bone of skull base, it was difficult to extirpate surgically, so the ventriculoperitoneal shunt combined with local biopsy was performed. The postoperative pathology and immunohistochemical findings confirmed the lesion was an endolymphatic sac tumor. After operation, the patient regularly received radiotherapy."
