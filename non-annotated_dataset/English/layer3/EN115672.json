  "text": "In this report, we presented a boy with intermittent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, whose genetic analysis showed a new compound heterozygote determined by three mutations, c.211G > A (p.G71R), c.508_510delTTC (p.F170-) and c.1456Â T > G (p.Y486D) in the hotspot regions of the UGT1A1 gene (exons 1 and 5) in Asian populations, presenting a genotype compatible with clinical picture of CNS-II. The family genetic analysis confirmed the origin of these mutations."
