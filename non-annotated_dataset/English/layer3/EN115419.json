  "text": "Twelve months after R0 tumor resection surgery, including microvascular reconstruction of the lower jaw followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, the patient was admitted for osteosynthesis plates removal. During clinical examination a tumor located at his left upper arm was detected. According to the patient the tumor has demonstrated rapid growth. Macroscopic appearance and conventional imaging led to the differential diagnosis of an abscess. MR-imaging could not differentiate between a tumor of soft tissue origin and a metastasis. A biopsy was taken and the pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of an OSCC metastasis. The postoperative interdisciplinary tumor board recommended radiation therapy."
