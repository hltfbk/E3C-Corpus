  "text": "A 25-year-old woman fell from a chair, injuring her left forearm and wrist. On admission, plain roentgenograms of the left upper extremity revealed an anterior, Bado type-1 Monteggia fracture-dislocation associated with an ipsilateral distal radius fracture. The patient underwent surgical treatment of both injuries with a 3.5 limited contact dynamic compression plate for ulna and a 3.5 mm T-type buttress locking plate for distal radius. Intraoperative roentgenogram showed a spontaneous reduction of the ipsilateral dislocated radial head following osteosynthesis. An above, the elbow plaster cast was applied for 2 weeks because of the radial head dislocation. 10 weeks postoperatively the patient regained full range of motion of her wrist, elbow, and supination/pronation in her forearm. 4 months postoperatively she was returned to her previous daily activity after roentgenograms showed complete bone healing."
