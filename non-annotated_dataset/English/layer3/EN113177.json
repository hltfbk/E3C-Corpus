  "text": "We report a Chinese family with patients presenting diverse phenotype of Keratosis pilaris. A next-generation sequencing panel interrogating 25 ichthyosis related genes with sequencing coverage of the coding regions and splice site junctions, was applied to screen genetic mutations. A gross deletion encompassing the STS gene ranging from exon 1-10 and the FLG c.3321delA mutation were identified in a 31-year old male proband, one of his sister, and his mother, and all the three patients showed obvious symptom. The deletion of STS gene was confirmed by real-time quantitative PCR. The proband's another sister and his two nephews carried only FLG c.3321delA mutation. Patients carried both mutations presented more severe symptom, while those only carried FLG c.3321delA mutation showed slight or normal phenotype."
