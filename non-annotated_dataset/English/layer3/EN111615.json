  "text": "We present a 37-year-old female patient who underwent resection of an 8.5 cm × 8 cm × 4 cm retroperitoneal tumour, which eventually was diagnosed as PEComa of uncertain biological behaviour. Three years after the operation, the patient remains without any evidence of recurrence. A search was performed in the Medline and EMBASE databases for articles published between 1996 and 2018, and we identified 31 articles related to retroperitoneal and perinephric PEComas. We focused on sex, age, maximum dimension, histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of the tumour, follow-up and long-term outcome. Thirty-four retroperitoneal (including the present one) and ten perinephric PEComas were identified, carrying a malignant potential rate of 44% and 60%, respectively. Nearly half of the potentially malignant PEComas presented with or developed metastases during the course of the disease."
