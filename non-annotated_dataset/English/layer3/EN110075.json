  "text": "A 75-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with a 48-hour history of abdominal pain, emesis, and low fever. He reported that the pain was progressive in nature. The patient's medical history was significant for hypertension. On physical exam, he was febrile (38.5Â°C), with normal vital signs. Physical examination demonstrated diffuse lower abdominal tenderness with peritoneal signs. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (WBC : 16.000/ mm 3) and elevation of the C-reactive protein (CRP : 22 mg/dl). There were no other abnormal values on peripheral blood analysis or serum biochemical analysis. Sonography found a noncompressible distended appendix in the right lower quadrant and free fluid in the hole abdominal cavity. After a pre-operative reanimation, a median laparotomy was performed. The exploration showed an acute generalized peritonitis with 300 mm 3 of pus, false membranes and a phlegmonous pelvic appendix perforated in its apex. An appendectomy and peritoneal toilet were subsequently performed. A 2 cm nodular protrusion in the mid portion of the appendix was observed, and the specimen was submitted to frozen section. The cut section of the tumor was tan-yellow with vague whorls. Histology showed a monotonous spindle morphology characteristic of GISTs, with irregular fascicles and variably sclerosed stroma. The tumor showed strong expression of CD34 and CD117 but was negative for desmin, h-caldesmon, SMA, and S-100. The tumor was diagnosed as low-risk GISTs according to the National Institutes of Health consensus criteria for diagnosis and risk assessment of GISTs, corresponding to prognostic groups 2 in the classification by Miettinen and Lasota. Adjuvant therapy was not administrated to the patient and no evidence of recurrence or metastasis was observed at the 48-month follow-up."
