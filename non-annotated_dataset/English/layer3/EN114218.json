  "text": "We present case of 58-year-old male patient with swelling over thenar region of left hand where the initial fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) report suggested diagnosis of ganglion/synovial cyst, but the patient did not improve with conservative treatment. FNAC was repeated which showed granulomatous inflammation consistent with the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis and antitubercular therapy for 9 months was given. Swelling disappeared and normal range of movements was attained in adjacent joints at final follow-up of 12 months from initiation of antitubercular treatment (ATT)."
