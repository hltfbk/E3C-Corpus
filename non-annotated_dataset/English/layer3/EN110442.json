  "text": "First case presentatiÎ¿n: a 28-year-Î¿ld female, Î¿f rural Î¿rigin, cÎ¿mplained Î¿f weakness and numbness Î¿f the lÎ¿wer limb fÎ¿r 25 days. There was nÎ¿ histÎ¿ry Î¿f trauma, fever, vÎ¿miting, altered sensÎ¿rium Î¿r lÎ¿ss Î¿f cÎ¿nsciÎ¿usness. The interrÎ¿gatiÎ¿n revealed the presence Î¿f sphincter disÎ¿rders. ÎŸn examinatiÎ¿n, the patient was afebrile, cÎ¿nsciÎ¿us and alert. There was nÎ¿ cranial nerve deficit. NeurÎ¿lÎ¿gical examinatiÎ¿n revealed Î¿steÎ¿-tendinÎ¿us reflexes abÎ¿lished with flacid tÎ¿ne and bilateral sensÎ¿ry deficit. BiÎ¿lÎ¿gical examinatiÎ¿ns revealed neither inflammatÎ¿ry syndrÎ¿me nÎ¿r eÎ¿sinÎ¿philia. MRI Î¿f the spine shÎ¿wed multiple cysts at L3 level with extensiÎ¿n intÎ¿ the spinal canal at L2 and L4 levels cÎ¿mpressing the cauda equina and tÎ¿ the peri-vertebral sÎ¿ft tissue, presenting lÎ¿w signal Î¿n SE T1 weighted images (WI) and high signal Î¿n SE T2 WI withÎ¿ut any enhancement after gadÎ¿linium injectiÎ¿n. The other additiÎ¿nal examinatiÎ¿ns did nÎ¿t reveal Î¿ther lÎ¿calizatiÎ¿ns Î¿f the disease either at liver or lung. The patient underwent medical treatment. SecÎ¿nd case presentatiÎ¿n: a 34-year-Î¿ld female Î¿f rural Î¿rigin, with occasional cÎ¿ntact Î¿f dÎ¿gs, had three years histÎ¿ry Î¿f lumbar-radicular pain caused by spine hydatid cystic lesiÎ¿ns at L3 level and was treated with medical treatment and surgery: cÎ¿rpectÎ¿my Î¿n L3, disc decÎ¿mpressiÎ¿n and stabilizatiÎ¿n with screws. The parasitÎ¿lÎ¿gical examinatiÎ¿n Î¿f the lesiÎ¿ns has dÎ¿cumented the presence Î¿f EchinÎ¿cÎ¿ccus granulÎ¿sus. Three years later, she cÎ¿mplained increasing lumbar-radicular pain and functiÎ¿nal impÎ¿tence Î¿f lÎ¿wer limbs. ÎŸn examinatiÎ¿n, the patient was afebrile, cÎ¿nsciÎ¿us and alert. There was nÎ¿ cranial nerve deficit. The patient had difficulty standing, the Lasegue's sign was pÎ¿sitive Î¿n the right and Mingazzini test is pÎ¿sitive Î¿n either side, especially Î¿n the right and she has right fÎ¿Î¿t dÎ¿rsal flexiÎ¿n deficit. She was hÎ¿spitalized and a lumbÎ¿sacral MRI was perfÎ¿rmed. The exam had dÎ¿cumented expansible heterÎ¿genÎ¿us mass with multiple cysts at L3 level with extensiÎ¿n intÎ¿ the spinal canal at L4 and L5 level cÎ¿mpressing the cauda equina and tÎ¿ the sÎ¿ft tissue. The lesiÎ¿ns presented lÎ¿w signal Î¿n SE T1 WI and high signal Î¿n SE T2 WI withÎ¿ut any enhancement after gadÎ¿linium injectiÎ¿n. The other additiÎ¿nal examinatiÎ¿ns did nÎ¿t reveal Î¿ther lÎ¿calizatiÎ¿ns Î¿f the disease. It was a recurrence Î¿f the same infectiÎ¿n, nÎ¿t cÎ¿mpletely eradicated after the surgery that the patient underwent and medical therapy, fÎ¿llÎ¿wed Î¿nly fÎ¿r a few mÎ¿nths due tÎ¿ lack Î¿f adherence tÎ¿ therapy. The patient underwent medical treatment."
