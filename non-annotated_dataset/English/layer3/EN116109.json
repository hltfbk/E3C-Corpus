  "text": "We report the case of a 36-year-old man that presented nausea and a dull abdominal pain for a week and then felt an acute neuralgic pain involving both shoulders that lasted for 8 to 10 hours. Immediately after, the patient presented a severe bilateral muscular weakness of the proximal part of both upper limbs, corresponding to an amyotrophic neuralgia. Two days after the shoulder pain, the patient presented a dysphagia necessitating tube feeding.  A blood sample confirmed hepatitis caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV; genotype 3F). Oral feeding resumed progressively after five months. The patient was fully independent for the activities of daily living but was still unable to work after six months."
