The pathologic diagnosis of the ovary was MCT containing complete colonic structure. The colonic wall exhibited complete structure of the large intestine composed of mucosa, submucosa, proper muscle, subserosa and serosa. It also contained sebaceous gland, sweat glands, fat tissue, and bone. The patient recovered without any complications."
