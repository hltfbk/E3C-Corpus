  "text": "A 39-year-old man was referred to the outpatient neurology clinic with a two month history of distal upper extremities numbness and fine motor movement difficulties. Initial vitamin B12 level was normal. A repeat MR imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine showed extensive posterior cervical cord flame-shaped lesions. His repeat vitamin B12 level was 41 pg/ml (normal; 200 ph/ml). He received monthly injections of vitamin B12. After six months his symptoms were resolved and his repeat spinal MRI showed resolution of the previous lesions."
