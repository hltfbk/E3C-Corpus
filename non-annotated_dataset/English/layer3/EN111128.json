  "text": "A 59-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with abdominal pain, headache, and nausea. Abdominal enhanced computed tomography revealed liver tumor, splenic infarction, and bilateral renal infarction. Multiple acute cerebral infarctions were also detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Her preoperative serum levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) were > 120,000 U/mL and 589.6 ng/mL, respectively, which were extremely high. Histopathology after right hepatectomy revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Her serum levels of CA19-9 were trending down to 9029.2 and 2659.8 U/mL at 1 and 3 weeks after surgery, respectively. However, at 7 weeks after surgery, her CA19-9 levels increased in the presence of positive imaging findings in the remnant liver, hilar lymph nodes, and peritoneal cavity. The initiation of combination chemotherapy including gemcitabine and cisplatin had a significant effect. The patient was doing well at 6 months after the surgery."
