  "text": "We report a case of vaginal cuff dehiscence in a 45-year-old multiparous Taiwanese woman who had undergone abdominal total hysterectomy and presented with vaginal cuff dehiscence precipitated by sexual intercourse. Immediate laparoscopic repair was done. Few authors have reported the utilization of the laparoscopic approach. It allows thorough inspection, visualization, and irrigation of the abdominal cavity. It is also associated with fewer intraoperative and postoperative complications."
