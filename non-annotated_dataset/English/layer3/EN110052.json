  "text": "A 30 year female, gravid 7 para 7, with uncomplicated previous pregnancies, presented to hospital with history of bilateral subcostal pain more on the right side and not perceiving fetal movements for last 5 days at 27 weeks of pregnancy. There was no history of trauma, jaundice, any bleeding disorders previously. On examination, she was found to have mild pallor, and a tender hepatomegaly. There was no icterus and the patient was hemodynamically stable, her blood pressure was also normal. Ultrasonography revealed intrauterine fetal death and a subcapsular hematoma of size 8.9cm X 8.6 cm in the liver. Computed tomography showed a large subcapsular hematoma almost occupying 25% of the liver volume causing compression and indentation of liver parenchyma and few hepatic intraparenchymal hematomas. Her laboratory parameters were as follows: hemoglobin 10.2gm%, total leucocyte counts 11000/mm 3, platelets 2,79,000/mm 3, prothrombin time 13/sec, INR 1.0, bleeding time 3 min, clotting time 7min, peripheral smear showed normocytic normochromic to mildly hypochromic picture with adequate platelets adequate, total protein 5.5 gm%, serum albumin was 2.6 gm%, total bilirubin was 0.9gm%, conjugated bilirubin 0.2 gm%, aspartate aminotransferase 330 IU/li, alanine aminotransferase 270 IU/li, and alkaline phosphatase was 323 IU/li. Her routine and microscopic examination was also normal. She was conservatively managed, as she was stable, with complete bed rest, prophylactic antibiotics and analgesics. She didn't require any blood transfusions. Due to intrauterine fetal death, she underwent an induced abortion on 5 th admission. Her condition remained static and was discharged after a watchful period of next 5 days. She is asymptomatic during follow-up visits till a period of 6 months, her serial sonographic scans show gradual decrease in the size of the hematoma."
