  "text": "A 62-year-old Asian woman with a history of gastrojejunostomy for peptic ulcer disease was admitted to hospital with epigastric pain, vomiting and dehydration. All investigations concluded gastric outlet obstruction secondary to a \"stricture\" at the site of gastrojejunostomy. Subsequent laparotomy revealed that the cause of the obstruction was a bezoar."
