  "text": "We report the case of a lichenoid eruption in a male drug addict who administered oral heroin (diamorphine) intravenously. Diamorphine was stopped immediately. Following topical steroids, phototherapy and oral acitretin, the lesions gradually disappeared. A lymphocyte transformation test was negative for pure morphine and codeine."
