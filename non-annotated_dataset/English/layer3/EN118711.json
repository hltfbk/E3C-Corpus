  "text": "We present a fifty-three year old Caucasian gentleman with plateau iris associated with peripheral iris cysts, in which the iridotrabecular angle did not widen despite having had both laser peripheral iridotomy and iridoplasty. The patient has remained asymptomatic over 12 months, and is under close follow-up to monitor for signs of glaucoma."
