  "text": "Here we report two paediatric cases of M.pneumoniae infection-induced MERS. The diagnosis of M.pneumoniae infection was established based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and specific serum antibodies (IgM). Both of the two patients presented with mild encephalopathy manifestations and recovered completely within a few days. The initial MRI showed a lesion in the central portion of the splenium of the corpus callosum, which completely resolved on the seventh and eighth day after admission for case 1 and case 2. Lumbar puncture was performed in both patients, which revealed no pleocytosis. In case 1, the patient had hyponatremia, peripheral facial nerve paralysis, and rash. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first MERS case associated with peripheral nerve damage. In case 2, interleukin-6(IL-6) was moderately increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It suggested that IL-6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of M.pneumoniae-induced MERS."
