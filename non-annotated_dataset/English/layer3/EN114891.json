  "text": "A 13-year-old boy presented with waist pain and low-grade fever for 8 months. The biopsy of soft tissue lesions around the thoracic spine showed that these cells were positive for ALK-1, CD30, leukocyte common antigen, CD3, CD4, and CD8, as well as being negative for epithelial membrane antigen and pan-cytokeratin, which revealed ALCL. After six cycles of a regimen consisting of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone/methotrexate and cytarabine (hyper-CVAD/MA) and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, he achieved complete remission (CR)."
