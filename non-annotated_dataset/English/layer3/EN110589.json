  "text": "A 72-year-old female patient was admitted due to fever, headache and gait instability. During the first several days she developed somnolence, aphasia, urinary incontinence, constipation, and asymmetric lower extremities weakness. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated encephalitis. Native brain computed tomography and MR were unremarkable, while spinal MR demonstrated cauda equina enhancement without cord lesions. Virology testing revealed WNV IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, which confirmed acute WNV NID. The treatment was supportive. After two months only a slight improvement was noticed but cognitive impairment, loss of sphincter control and asymmetric inferior extremities weakness remained. The patient died after a month on chronic rehabilitation."
