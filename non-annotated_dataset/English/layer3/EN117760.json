  "text": "A 47 year old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presented to the hospital with symptomatic profound hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration of 105 meq/L) due to a recent infection and binge drinking. The patient was treated with antibiotics, diuretics and hypertonic saline and was placed on a fluid restricted diet. The serum sodium level corrected slowly over four days with symptomatic improvement occurring after two days. A brief discussion of the symptoms and treatment of acute and chronic hyponatremia in the setting of cirrhosis is included."
