  "text": "A North Lebanese family has been examined, from an index case, a 40-year-old woman, who had a history of venous thrombosis with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. The index case was found to be heterozygous for factor V Leiden G1691A, prothrombin G20210A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T gene variants. Her family members were heterozygous for at least two of the three-point mutations, and multiple risk factors associated with thrombophilia were identified."
