  "text": "A 66-year-old Caucasian lady presented with painless lump in her right breast. Mammography showed features of fibroadenoma with calcification and fine needle aspiration cytology was reported as showing malignant cells (C5). Wide local excision was performed and histological features were consistent with primary osteosarcoma with predominance of osteoclastic activity. Subsequent completion mastectomy was performed because of suspicion of incomplete excision. She remains disease free 8 years from her initial surgery."
