  "text": "We share the key notes and our surgical procedures in the form of four typical case presentations. All patients were diagnosed with cervical degenerative disc disease with myelopathy or radiculopathy and needed multilevel cervical spine surgery. The first case demonstrated that index levels indicating the presence of highly serious spinal cord compression required a prioritized decompression. The second case demonstrated that the disc replacement should be performed before fusion in cervical hybrid surgery. The third and forth cases demonstrated that a top-down implantation sequence was needed in continuous two-level cervical disc replacement. The symptoms of all patients were significantly relieved after surgery."
