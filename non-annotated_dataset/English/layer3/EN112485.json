  "text": "A 74-year-old man who presented with dysphagia for half a year underwent a series of checks, such as gastroendoscopy, X-ray contrast examination of the upper digestive tract, endoscopic ultrasonography, high-resolution esophageal manometry, and positron emission computed tomography. It should be noted that the stenosis of the esophagus was too narrow for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. The cause remained undiagnosed. Eventually, the tunnel endoscopic technique was perform for the pathological examination in the submucosa and the final diagnosis was adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The patient and family members chose expectant treatment due to the patient's age and the high costs of surgical treatment."
