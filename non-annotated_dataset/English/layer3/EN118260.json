  "text": "A 14-year-old girl of Asian ethnicity presented with gradual loss of vision. A computed tomography scan of her head showed a diffuse, homogeneously ill-defined hyperdense lesion of size 2.9 x 5.3 cm (anteroposterior x thickness) involving the right orbit. Biopsy of the lesion confirmed the presence of epithelioid cells and Langerhans giant cells with caseous material. After surgical debridement with antitubercular treatment, the patient had an uneventful recovery."
