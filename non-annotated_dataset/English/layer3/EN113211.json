  "text": "A 54-year-old female with unremarkable history presented to the clinic with a chief complaint of vaginal bleeding. Further examination identified a pedunculated mass on the vaginal wall. Histologic examination revealed a metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Radiological studies then revealed a left renal mass and bilateral adrenal masses. The patient underwent a nephrectomy, adrenalectomy, and resection of the vaginal mass. The mass in the vagina has since recurred."
