  "text": "A 30-year old woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of hematuria and renal insufficiency. Upon examination, her urinary protein level was 40 mg/day and occult blood in her urine was 2+. The patient's urinary dysmorphic red blood cell sediment was 30-49/high power field. In contrast, her serum creatinine levels increased from 0.57 mg/dl to 0.86 mg/dl during the previous 2-years, without special events. She suffered from far-sightedness and astigmatism beginning at birth; She had no family history of renal disease. Renal biopsy demonstrated cystic dilatation of the Bowman's capsule and atrophy of the glomerular tuft. The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) was thin, with an average thickness of 191 nm. Next-generation sequencing was used to evaluate for mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4, associated with TBMN, and UMOD, MUC1, and SEC61A1, associated with hereditary GCKD. No pathogenic mutations were identified. We thus diagnosed the patient with TBMN coexistent with sporadic GCKD."
