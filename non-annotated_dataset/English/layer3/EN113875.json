  "text": "The participant was a 17-year-old male who injured his left tibia in a motorcycle traffic accident. Physical examination revealed a wound of 13 cm Ã— 7 cm extending from the medial lower leg to the posterior aspect, with extensive skin loss. There was no nerve or vascular injury. The tibia was exposed, with detachment of the periosteum. The radiograph revealed a tibial shaft fracture. The AO/OTA classification was 42-A3.3, and it was classified as a Gustilo-Anderson Type 3B fracture. Gastrocnemius muscle and soleus muscle flaps were lifted in the area of the soft-tissue defect and then, placed over the tibia. Despite this, the distal portion of the tibia remained uncovered. Therefore, a flexor hallucis longus flap was lifted and placed over the distal portion of the tibia. On day 7 after the injury, the external fixation device was removed and the tibial shaft was fixated with two Ender nails (4.5 mm in diameter). The clinical course was satisfactory, and the skin graft and flap were successful. Bone union was achieved without infection, and the resulting range of motion was normal."
