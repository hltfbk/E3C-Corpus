  "text": "A 39-year-old previously healthy woman was admitted at the emergency service with clinical signs of intestinal obstruction.\nPhysical examination revealed a mass at right inguinal area which was not reducible or pulsatile.\nAbdominal radiographs showed small bowel obstruction. A diagnosis of strangulated inguinal hernia was made.\nOperation was done under general anesthesia, a median incision was performed, on exploration a strangulated Meckel’s diverticulum was found in the sac of obstructed inguinal hernia. The diverticulum measured 2cm and was located on the antimesenteric surface, 90 cm from the ileocecal valve. Due to the broad base and necrosis of the Meckel’s diverticulum, a small bowel segment was resected and continuity of ileum restored by an end to end anastomosis. The patient made a rapid and uneventful post operative recovery."
