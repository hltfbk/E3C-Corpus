  "text": "A 58-year-old woman presented to the ophthalmology clinic with 1 and a half years of right eye redness, ocular hypertension and recurrent headache. One and a half years ago she was diagnosed with right eye dry eye and glaucoma and had received treatment according to this diagnosis. However, none of the treatments led to any improvement in redness and headache. Physical examination revealed dry eye and severe corkscrew hyperaemia with dilated vessels in the right eye. The results of fundoscopic examination of both eyes were normal. After we considered that the symptoms may be related to abnormal intracranial vessels, computed tomography angiography and venography (CTA + CTV) were performed, and the results showed an arteriovenous malformation in the right parietal-occipital area in the brain. The AVM was definitively located by further examination with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). After AVM endovascular embolism treatment, the conjunctival congestion of the right eye was significantly relieved, and the intraocular pressure decreased to normal."
