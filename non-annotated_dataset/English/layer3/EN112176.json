  "text": "The patient in this study was a 31-year-old Japanese woman, and at 30 weeks of pregnancy she was admitted with marked fatigue. Fetal bradycardia was noted, and the child was delivered by emergency cesarean section but was stillborn. The maternal blood sugar level was high (427 mg/dL), but the glycated hemoglobin value was 6.2%; therefore, fulminant type 1 diabetes was suspected. Serum antibody testing confirmed a Coxsackievirus B1 infection. The patient in this case had fulminant type 1 diabetes in pregnancy associated with Coxsackievirus B1."
