  "text": "This report describes a two-year-old Arab descent female presenting with a history of high-grade fever of 2 days duration with non-specific signs of viral illness and erythematous rash. The patients' condition deteriorated rapidly requiring admission to intensive care unit. In the intensive care unit, she developed a right upper quadrant mass that was diagnosed as hydrops of the gallbladder by ultrasonography. After one dose of intravenous immunoglobulin, the patient started to recover and was transferred out of intensive care after 2 days."
