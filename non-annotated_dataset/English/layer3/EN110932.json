  "text": "Two boys presented with an unusual mechanism of injury. They fell from a height to be impaled by a large stick. Appropriate emergency medical service was not available and surgery was delayed by more than 24â€‰h after the accident. Both children were labelled \"lucky\" as they survived the injury without any significant sequelae."
