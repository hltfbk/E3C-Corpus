  "text": "A 60-year-old man with a hepatic tumor was referred to Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital. He had a history of chronic hepatitis C. Computed tomography showed a liver tumor 20â€‰mm in diameter in segment 6 of the Couinaud classification, with ring calcification. Based on this uncommon imaging presentation and the patient's past exposure to the definitive hosts of Echinococcus multilocularis, he was preoperatively diagnosed with echinococcosis. Partial hepatectomy was performed as a radical treatment for echinococcosis. A final diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma was confirmed based on pathological findings. The patient was discharged uneventfully."
