  "text": "This report describes a case of a 48-year-old man, an amateur triathlete, with deep gluteal pain in the left hip for 12 months, leading to a decline in sports performance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormalities that suggested a PHT. Surgery was indicated following the failure of conservative treatments. Debridement of the conjoint tendon and its reinsertion associated with semimembranosus tenotomy showed good results and is thus an option for the treatment of this pathology after 12 months of follow-up."
