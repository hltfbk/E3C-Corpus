  "text": "We reported a case of pulmonary tuberculosis with pneumatocele formation after antituberculous treatment. A 41-year-old man presented with fever and productive cough for 3 weeks. Chest X ray revealed cavitary lesions in bilateral upper lobes of the lung. Acid-fast rods were found in sputum and the cultures subsequently yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis. After antituberculous treatment, obvious pneumatocele formation was noted in the right upper lobe."
