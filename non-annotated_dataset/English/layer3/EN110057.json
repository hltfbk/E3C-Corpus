  "text": "NN, a female new-born of caesarean section delivery at 36 weeks gestation weighted at birth 2700g, her height was 44cm and her head circumference 35 cm. She was born in Lubumbashi in the South of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (D.R.C). Her mother is a 41 years old multiparous, grava 12 para 11. Both her parents are Congolese but non consanguineous and there was no relevant family history. The clinical examination revealed that NN was born alive and presented a severe hydropsfetalis. Were also noted an important hypoplastic face, a bilateral microtia with ears set low on the head. The new-born presented also a narrow thorax and a protuberant abdomen. Short-limbed dwarfism was observed: short arms and forarms (upper limbs: 11cm) as well as short thighs and legs (lower limbs 14 cm). The hand examination revealed a brachydactyly and a postaxial (ulnar) hexadactyly on all four limbs. The patient died at day 2 before a radiographic examination of the entire skeleton and an abdominal ultra-sound had been performed."
