  "text": "We report a case of 60 year old Caucasian female with history of long standing diabetes and chronic kidney disease stage 5 who presented with a very high calcium phosphorous product, markedly elevated intact PTH levels and X-ray changes consistent with diagnosis of calciphylaxis. Patient was initially managed by parathyroidectomy and later on was also treated with intravenous sodium thiosulfate thrice weekly with each hemodialysis session for duration of 10 weeks."
