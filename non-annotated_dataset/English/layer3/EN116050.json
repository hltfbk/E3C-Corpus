  "text": "We report a case of juvenile xanthogranuloma in a male child with onset in the fourth month of life. He presented with a nodule 8 millimeters in diameter, tan-orange in color, ulcerated in the centre, located on the left corner of the left eye. A biopsy without total excision was performed. After the biopsy, the nodule enlarged to 1.5 cm in diameter and became haemorrhagic. The histologic evaluation and immunohistochemistry analysis resulted in the diagnosis of juvenile xanthogranuloma. For aesthetic reasons the nodule was removed by surgical resection."
