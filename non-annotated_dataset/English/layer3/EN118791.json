  "text": "A 5-year-old boy from non-consanguineous family in Austria was born with features of Pierre-Robin association (cleft palate, micrognathia, and glossoptosis). Radiological examination at birth revealed coronal clefts of the vertebrae, platyspondyly, and flaring of the metaphyses of the long bones (features suggestive of the Weissenbacher-Zweymuller syndrome). Significant features of ectodermal dysplasia such as sparse hair, defective dentition, dysplastic nails, and deficient sweating associated with bouts of unexplained hyperthermia were present. These features not shared by Stickler syndrome, Wagner syndrome, or Weissenbacher - Zweymuller syndrome, all of which are conditions often confused with Marshall syndrome."
