  "text": "A 43-year-old African American woman presented with a painful cystic mass on the left labia majora. A preoperative diagnosis of Bartholin's abscess was made. During excision and draining, an additional tan-brown dermal nodule was removed which demonstrated histological features of Hidradenoma papilliferum."
