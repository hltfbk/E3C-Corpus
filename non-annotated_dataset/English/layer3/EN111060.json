  "text": "A 67-year-old woman presented with a superior mediastinal mass that was revealed by chest computed tomography (CT), an optional examination she hoped, during a medical checkup. Contrast-enhanced CT scan performed in our hospital for close examination confirmed the presence of a 2 × 1.3 cm poorly enhanced mass anterior to the trachea during the arterial phase. Magnetic resonance imaging depicted low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. I-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine did not accumulate in the mass. Serum levels of interleukin-2 receptor, catecholamine, and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody were within the normal range. The mass was resected through a transverse neck incision for the diagnosis and treatment. The histopathological diagnosis of the specimen was ectopic mediastinal thyroid tissue associated with MALT lymphoma and chronic thyroiditis. Immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch recombination was identified. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the cervical thyroid showed chronic thyroiditis but not lymphoma. The patient's postoperative thyroid function was normal. To date, the patient's recovery has been uneventful, and she is being monitored without further treatment."
