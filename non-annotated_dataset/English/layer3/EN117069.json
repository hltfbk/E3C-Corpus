  "text": "This paper describes a 73-year-old man who presented with a rash that started 1 week prior to his presentation. The rash was associated with fever, dyspnea, and cough. He was admitted for pneumonia and started on intravenous antibiotics. After 3 days, he became confused and developed multiorgan dysfunction. Work-up for possible hematologic disorders, autoimmune diseases, and pneumonia was negative. One month prior to the onset of the rash, allopurinol had been prescribed for asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The allopurinol was stopped and corticosteroids were started; 2 days later, the patient became afebrile and the dyspnea resolved. He was diagnosed with DRESS syndrome, which is associated with high mortality."
