  "text": "A case of intratracheal myiasis is reported. A 61-year-old male patient with a history of laryngectomy was admitted to hospital due to tracheostomal hemorrhage of 3â€‰h duration. Intratracheal myiasis was confirmed by bronchoscopy, and the patient underwent bronchoscopic intervention, which was complicated by a tracheal-esophageal fistula and resolved by endotracheal stenting. Twenty months after stent placement, the fistula had not healed."
