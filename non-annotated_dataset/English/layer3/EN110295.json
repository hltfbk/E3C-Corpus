  "text": "A 32-year-old woman (gravida 1, parity 0) was admitted to the hospital for prenatal follow-up in the first trimester. There was no significant medical history. The woman's body weight was 58 kg, height was 154 cm. Her husband had no OI and height was 159 cm. First trimester screening was done at 12w+3d of pregnancy. Fetal nuchal translucency thickness was 2.1 mm at that time. Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) were measured in the mother's blood sampling and no abnormal results were detected (1.2 mom and 0.9 mom, respectively). Second trimester ultrasound showed incurved femurs of the fetus at 18 weeks of gestation. Parents were given genetic counseling and amniocentesis was recommended. Parents refused amniocentesis and decided to carry their pregnancy until term. Prenatal ultrasonography in the third trimester showed that the biparietal diameter and abdominal circumference were equivalent to 38 weeks. However, right and left femurs were measured 6.2 and 6.3 cm, respectively (< 2 SD). A cesarean section was performed at 39th gestational week for breech presentation, and a 2630 gram female baby with a body length of 48 cm was delivered. On postnatal radiography, mild osteopenia and the curvature of the femurs were detected. Molecular analysis of the newborn showed that a G to T change at position c.560 (c.560 G > T) of the exon 12 in the COL1A2 gene; which lead to the glycine modification with valine (p.Gly187Val) at codon 187. Orally informed consent was taken from patient."
