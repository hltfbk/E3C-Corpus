  "text": "The case described shows remission of a disseminated cholangiocellular carcinoma (focal changes in liver, metastases to lungs) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The initial diagnosis was based on ultrasound examination and confirmed with computer tomography. Tumour biopsy and histopathological examination revealed cholangiocellular carcinoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy. After remission of lesions in lungs and reduction/regression of tumours in liver to one focal change, right lobe liver resection was performed. The histopathological examination did not reveal any viable carcinoma cells, only necrotic tissues in place of the primary tumour as well as in local portal vein branches was seen. Thirty months after the operation the patient is in a good overall condition and no recurrence has been observed."
