  "text": "Two firm pedunculated nodular lesions were noticed in the mouth of a 3-day-old black female: one on the anterior maxillary ridge and the other further posteriorly in the midline of the palate. Both lesions were excised when the baby was nine days old. Microscopic examination of the lesions showed densely packed round to oval cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and uniform nuclei. The diagnosis was congenital granular cell tumour."
