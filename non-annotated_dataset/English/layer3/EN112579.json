  "text": "17-year-old male patient sustained a minor ankle trauma while skating. Initials findings were a 1cm wound in relation with his left lateral malleolus and moderate swelling. About 6 h later, the patient was admitted at the emergency room with disproportionate limb pain, increased swelling, persistent fever, paleness, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient was intubated due to his unstable hemodynamic condition and underwent fasciotomy of the limb. A vacuum-assisted closure device was used. After the first surgical procedure, patient's condition radically improved. He was extubated with good clinical prognosis. He underwent several surgical procedures in a 3-weeks lapse until the wound finally healed."
