  "text": "A 54-year-old Tunisian woman, with no past medical history of lupus erythematosus or infectious disease, presented with a 3-month history of a slowly enlarging erythematous and infiltrated plaque, extending over the nose, the right cheek, and the internal aspect of the right lower eyelid. Microscopic examination of a parasitological smear showed numerous leishmania in their amastigote form, inside monocytes, confirming the diagnosis of CL. Clinical aspect was in favor of lupoid CL. The patient was cured by fluconazole 200 mg/day for 6 weeks after pancreatic intolerance with intramuscular meglumine antimoniate (60 mg/kg/day for 7 days), and no response to doxycycline (200 mg/day for 6 weeks)."
