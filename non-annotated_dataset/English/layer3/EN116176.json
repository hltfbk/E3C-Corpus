Serum alkaline phosphatase, Î³-glutamyltransferase, bilirubin and IgG4 were prominently elevated. The antimitochondrial antibody was positive. Radiological examination revealed diffusive enlargement of the pancreas. Pancreatic biopsy showed lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, fibrosis and abundant IgG4+ plasma cells. The patient was diagnosed with AIP and PBC. Nasobiliary tube was placed to facilitate biliary drainage. A combination therapy of steroid and UDCA was administered and the patient was gradually recovered, during which the patient was complicated with biliary infecion, herpes zoster and pulmonary abscess."
