  "text": "This report details a 46-year-old male who presented with an open Type IIIA comminuted mid-shaft tibia and segmental fibula fractures after being struck by a car traveling 70mph. Computed tomography confirmed comminuted and displaced tibia and fibula fractures with PTFJ dislocation as well as air tracking through the anterior compartment of the leg communicating with the knee joint. He underwent open reduction internal fixation with intramedullary nailing of his tibial shaft fracture and PTFJ syndesmosis repair with two suture buttons. X-ray at post-operative follow-up 2 years later showed complete healing without evidence of failure or hardware loosening."
