  "text": "A 66-year-old gentleman presented with persistent fever and repeated hemoptysis for 8â€‰months. Computed tomography of the thorax confirmed the presence of a consolidation mass located in the right middle lobe and an air space near the right rib angle. During exploration, CBF was found. The patient underwent right middle and lower lobectomy together with closure of colonic and diaphragmatic perforation. The colon closure and diaphragm closure ruptured after surgery, leading to enterogenic empyema. Adequate drainage, sustained high protein diet, and antibiotic treatment eventually resulted in full recovery."
