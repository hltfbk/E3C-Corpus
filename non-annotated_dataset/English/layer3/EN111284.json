  "text": "In this case study, we presented a huge AVM of the upper lip in a 70-year-old man that he noticed since 5years ago with slow growth in this period. Computed tomography angiography revealed a large AVM with feeders from the right facial artery and its branch superior labial artery. Right facial artery showed increased diameter and tortuous changes. Selective catheterization of right carotid was performed followed by super selective catheterization of the right facial artery. Then, the embolization of the tumor blush was conducted. Surgical removal of the tumor was carried out10days after the embolization."
