  "text": "A 51-year-old man presented with recurrent epigastric pain and fullness for two years. No significant findings were noted during physical examination and routine blood tests were unremarkable. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a large cyst in the upper left abdominal quadrant. A following contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a hypodense cystic lesion between the spleen and stomach. The lesion had scattered calcification in the cyst wall without any significant enhancement. The lesion was initially thought to be a cystic lymphangioma. The patient underwent a surgical resection and intraoperatively it was noted that the lesion was closely adherent to the greater curvature of the stomach. Subsequently, a resection of the gastric mass along with a partial gastrectomy was performed. The patient recovered quickly with a complete symptomatic relief and did not show any further complications during the 8-month follow-up."
