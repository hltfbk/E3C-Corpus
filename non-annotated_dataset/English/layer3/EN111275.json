  "text": "A 69-year-old man was referred to our hospital for abdominal fullness and pain. Computed tomography (CT) showed a circumferential tumor in the ascending colon, accompanied by bulky swollen lymph nodes. Under the preoperative diagnosis of T4N2M1 (lymph nodes) ascending colon cancer, we performed a right hemicolectomy; however, paracaval and parailiac vein lymph nodes were abandoned. Pathological findings showed moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the subserosa accompanied by an LELC component invading the superficial muscularis propria. Lymph node metastases were found in a neighboring tumor and in retroperitoneal lymph nodes with glandular differentiation. No relation to microsatellite instability (MSI) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was observed. In the component with glandular differentiation, PD-L1 overexpression was revealed. CLR findings were also observed. The tumor was diagnosed as T3N2M1 cancer that was moderately to poorly differentiated and had an LELC component. The patient was treated with chemotherapy, and the metastasized lymph nodes ultimately disappeared. He was alive without tumor recurrence 5-years post-operation."
