  "text": "A 73-year-old female presented with metastatic FTC to the mandible and underwent total thyroidectomy, segmental mandibulectomy, bone impacted fibular free flap reconstruction, and adjuvant radioactive iodine treatment. The PubMed database was searched for literature describing thyroid cancer with facial skeleton metastasis using the key words \"thyroid,\" \"cancer,\" \"carcinoma,\" \"metastasis,\" and \"malignancy\" with \"oral cavity,\" \"maxilla,\" \"mandible,\" \"sinus,\" \"paranasal,\" and \"orbit.\" Reports that only involved the soft tissues were excluded. Systematic review revealed 59 cases of well-differentiated thyroid cancer with facial skeleton metastasis: 35 mandibular metastases (21 = FTC), 6 maxilla metastases (2 = FTC), 9 orbital metastases (4 = FTC), and 11 paranasal sinus metastases (7 = FTC). Treatment included surgery, RAI, external beam radiotherapy (XRT), or a combination of these modalities. The one, two, and five-year survival rates were 100%, 79%, and 16%, respectively."
