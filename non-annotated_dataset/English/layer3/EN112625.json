  "text": "We present the case of WJ, a 44-year old patient with known HIES(since the age of 11) and a 7-week history of left hip pain. We discuss the clinical presentation and the curveballs which came our way when investigating this patient and how we overcame them.We also demonstrate a very interesting pelvic radiograph from this patient which shows multiple sites of calcified apophyses. Something which is first unexpected in such patients and second something not previously reported in the literature."
