  "text": "A 17 year old male presented to the emergency room with history of high grade fever since two weeks. Examination revealed pallor, short stature and thumb polydactyly. There was no visceromegaly or lymphadenopathy. Complete blood count showed haemoglobin 3.4 gm/dl, MCV 100 fl and MCH 36 pg, white blood cell count 55.9 × 10 E9/L and platelet count 8 × 10E9/L. Peripheral blood smear revealed 26% blast cells. Bone marrow was hypercellular exhibiting infiltration with 21% blast cells. Auer rods were seen in few blast cells. These findings were consistent with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. These blasts cells expressed CD33, CD13, HLA-DR, CD117, CD34 antigens and cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase on immunophenotyping. Bone marrow cytogenetics revealed 46, XY, t (8:21) (q22; q22) [11] / 46, XY, add (2) (q37), t (8; 21) [4] / 46, XY [5]. Molecular studies showed positivity of FLT 3 D835 variant and negativity of NPM 1 and FLT3 ITD (internal tandem domain) mutation. Peripheral blood analysis for chromosomal breakage exhibited tri-radial and complex figures. He received induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin (3 + 7). Day 14 marrow revealed clearance of blast cells."
