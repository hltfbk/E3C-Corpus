  "text": "A 9-year-old boy presented to accident and emergency with 2 days history of the left-sided groin and thigh pain, inability to weight bear, and feeling generally unwell following a rugby match. There was no history of trauma or recent infection. On examination, the child had fever, limp on weight-bearing, tender groin, and signs of an irritable hip. Laboratory report showed raised inflammatory markers and blood culture showed Staphylococcus aureus. Presumptive diagnosis of septic hip joint was made as there was effusion on ultrasound examination. Specialist opinion was sought and MRI confirmed changes of the left pubic rami osteomyelitis. The child was treated with intravenous antibiotics, with excellent clinical response after 48 h."
