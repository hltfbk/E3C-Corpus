  "text": "A brown tumour in the mandible was diagnosed in 60 - year old female patient with no previous history of systemic disease. The x - rays showed radiolucent osteolytic lesion in the frontal area of the mandible affecting the lamina dura of the frontal teeth, and skull osteosclerosis in the form of salt and pepper sign. The blood analyses revealed increased values of PTH, calcitonin and Î² - cross-laps, indicating a primary HPT. The scintigraphy of the parathyroid glands showed a presence of adenoma in the left lower lobe. The tumour lesion was surgically removed together with the lower frontal teeth, and this was followed by total parathyroidectomy. The follow - up of one year did not reveal any signs of recurrence."
