  "text": "A 74-year-old man with gastric cancer T4b (transverse mesocolon) N3 M1 (peritoneum) received combination chemotherapy with intraperitoneal administration of paclitaxel, intravenous oxaliplatin, and oral S-1. Eight courses of combined chemotherapy had remarkable anti-tumor effects on the primary lesion, lymph node metastases, and peritoneal metastases. Total gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection was performed. Pathological examination revealed no viable tumor cells in the resected specimens. After gastrectomy, the patient received 25 courses of the same chemotherapy without oxaliplatin and has no evidence of recurrence 24â€‰months later."
