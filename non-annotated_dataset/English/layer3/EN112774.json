  "text": "A 66-year-old male presented at 3 months following a right total knee arthroplasty with a history of increased pain and swelling of the knee joint. Initially, he was treated with anti-inflammatories when the pain and swelling recurred, an aspiration demonstrated hemarthrosis of the knee. Further evaluation demonstrated no infection, a femoral angiography demonstrated prominence of medial superior and inferior geniculate arteries with a tumor blush appearance. Therapeutic embolization of both the arteries resulted in complete resolution of the symptoms in 1 month with return of full knee function. At the end of 1-year follow-up, the patient had return of full knee function with no pain and no recurrence."
