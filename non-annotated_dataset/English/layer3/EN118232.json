  "text": "We report a case of a 44-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman with diabetes who presented with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and fever over a period of five months. Her problem proved to be a diagnostic dilemma mimicking cholecystitis, pyelonephritis and ovarian cancer. Her blood cultures were positive on one occasion for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. An ultrasound scan suggested uterine fibroids but a computed tomography scan suggested an ovarian malignancy because the mass appeared heterogeneous with fluid filled areas. She was treated with several courses of antibiotics and eventually at laparotomy, she was found to have a large pyomyoma which was successfully removed by subtotal hysterectomy with immediate and complete resolution of her symptoms."
