  "text": "Here, we report a pair of 16-month-old twin boys with AE exhibiting periorificial and acral erythema, scales and blisters, while subsequent laboratory examination showed normal plasma zinc and alkaline phosphatase levels. Further Sanger sequencing demonstrated that the patients were compound heterozygous for two unreported SLC39A4 mutations: a missense mutation in exon 5 (c.926G > T), which led to a substitution of the 309th amino acid residue cysteine with phenylalanine, a splice site mutation occurring in the consensus donor site of intron 5 (c.976 + 2 T > A). A family study revealed that the boys' parents were heterozygous carriers of these two mutations."
