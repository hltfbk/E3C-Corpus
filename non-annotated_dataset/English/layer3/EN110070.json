  "text": "A 31-year-old African female presented to the Accident and Emergency Department of Kenyatta National Hospital with the chief complaints of headache, irregular menses, blurring of vision in the right eye and complete loss of vision in the left eye for 1 year. She was well prior to the onset of symptoms. The headache started first followed by gradual loss of vision in the left eye which progressed to complete loss of vision in that eye. This was then followed by progressive decline of vision in the right eye. The headache and decline in vision has progressively worsened over the one year period, but she reported temporary relief when on her medication. Her medication included bromocriptine and ocreotide. She also had associated symptoms of fever and night sweats. She did not complain of any nausea or vomiting. Her last menses were 2 months ago. There was no other significant history. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and has no past medical history or family history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. On examination, her vital signs were within normal. Of note, were her coarse facial features, enlarged hands and feet with sausage shaped fingers. Ocular exam of the right eye showed temporal hemianopia with decreased visual acuity. Examination of the left eye showed no perception of light. There were no other findings of significance. Investigations revealed an elevated prolactin level (Prolactin 1629uIU/ml), an elevated growth hormone level (Growth hormone 70.30ug/L) and an elevated fasting blood sugar (23.3mmol/L). Cortisol levels, thyroid hormone levels, thyroid stimulating hormone levels, urea, creatinine and electrolytes were all normal. HIV serology result was negative. Full blood count showed no evidence of infection. A CT scan and an MRI done both showed a suprasellar tumor with a cystic area suggestive of a hemorrhagic pituitary macroadenoma Figure 1, Figure 2. She was put on bromocriptine, ocreotide, analgesics and insulin, and once her blood sugars were controlled, she underwent transphenoidal surgery. Intra-operatively, after opening the dura of the sella turcica, brown (motor oil like) hematoma was encountered and evacuated. Tumor was brownish purple and soft in consistency. Near total resection of the tumor was achieved. Patient is doing well post-operatively."
