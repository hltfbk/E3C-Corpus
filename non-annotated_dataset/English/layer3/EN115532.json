  "text": "A 45-year-old female with Grade III B open comminuted olecranon fracture (30*15cm degloving area) and ulnar nerve palsy was treated with a novel ring fixator construct. Two cut-end olive wires were passed from the proximal olecranon across the fracture site in intramedullary fashion exiting dorsally at mid-ulnar level through healthy skin and were attached to an Ilizarov half ring secured by perpendicular wires. The olive wires were tensioned, achieving compression and stability. Range of motion (ROM) exercises could be started quickly as the elbow was not spanned. Wound healed after skin grafting and at one-year follow-up the patient has good functional results (PRE 7, DASH 9.48), elbow ROM 10째-130째, 75째 pronation and 85째 supination. The patient returned to pre-injury occupational activities and had no pain. At three-year follow-up, the x-ray and CT showed union of olecranon fragment with well-maintained congruency."
