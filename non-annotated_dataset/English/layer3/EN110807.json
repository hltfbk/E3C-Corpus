  "text": "We describe a 55-year-old male IgA nephropathy patient who was admitted with high fever and hematuria. Physical examination revealed impaired binocular vision with blurred vision, impaired hearing, and a congestive rash on the chest and back. Renal ultrasound examination showed no abnormalities. Laboratory examination showed that glomerulonephritis was complicated by infection, and anti-infection therapy was ineffective. Bilateral fluorescein angiography showed Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. Further renal biopsy confirmed IgA nephropathy. Hormone shock therapy and cyclophosphamide adjuvant therapy were administered, and the patient's symptoms improved."
