  "text": "We report two cases of bilateral macular pattern dystrophy in transfusion dependent patients undergoing chronic chelation therapy with deferoxamine due to thalassemias. Our patients were evaluated with multimodal imaging and the results are presented. Both patients had normal cone and rod responses in the full-field electroretinogram and continued the prescribed chelation therapy, after hematology consult. The patients were followed up every 3 months for 2 and 4 years respectively for possible deterioration. Their best corrected visual acuity remained stable with no anatomic change on Optical Coherence Tomography findings."
