  "text": "A 53-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of endometrial cancer (grade 2; International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics III A) was hospitalized in November 2017 for a left adrenal mass found on a follow-up computed tomography scan 3 years after her gynecological surgery. Laboratory test results were normal. A laparoscopic left adrenalectomy was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and no chemotherapy was administered. The pathological report confirmed an adrenal endometrioid metastasis. At 36 mo of follow-up, the patient is alive and well, with no evidence of recurrent disease. A literature review identified only 11 previously-published cases of adrenal metastases from uterine cancer."
