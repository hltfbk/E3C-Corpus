  "text": "A 53-year-old man visited our hospital complaining of epigastric pain. Based on radiological examinations, he was diagnosed as having pancreatitis, annular pancreas, and hepatomesenteric trunk. One month later, obstructive jaundice developed. Endoscopic examination revealed ampullary region carcinoma. We performed pancreaticoduodenectomy using the \"artery-first\" approach."
