  "text": "In the current paper, we introduced a 47-year-old Iranian male patient having painless, mobile, nontender, and firm mass in left shoulder. We did not find neurovascular disturbance at the upper extremity, and the patient had a full range of motion in the left shoulder. The tumor was treated with wide resection and followed by radiation therapy."
