  "text": "A 24-year-old Caucasian woman presented at 11 weeks' gestation with a monochorionic, monoamniotic twin pregnancy. A reversed arterial flow was noted on a Doppler imaging study coming from the larger, apparently normal twin to the smaller, grossly abnormal twin, and a diagnosis of twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence was made. Cardiac activity was undetectable in the recipient twin by 16 weeks' gestation. Further detailed assessment at 18 weeks' gestation revealed multiple congenital anomalies of the surviving pump twin, in keeping with a diagnosis of VACTERL association. A live infant girl was delivered at 39 weeks by elective cesarean section. She underwent extensive surgery with subsequent normal development at the age of two years."
