  "text": "A 70-year-old woman sought treatment for a year history of right upper eyelid swelling in May 2014. Since then, she underwent three surgical procedures in the right orbit in the same region (in 2014, 2016, and 2017). The pathology analysis of the three surgical tissue samples was consistent with myxofibrosarcoma, characterized by spindle-shaped cells and variably myxoid stroma. In the 2â€‰years follow-up after the third surgery, there was no evidence of tumor recurrence."
