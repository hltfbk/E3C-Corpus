  "text": "We report a case of 57-year-old male who presented to us with a history of chronic pain over the index finger metacarpophalangeal joint. Clinical examination revealed painful range of movement of the affected joint. Radiographs revealed lytic foci. A magnetic resonance imaging scan to further evaluate the condition revealed decreased joint space, articular cartilage thinning, and subarticular cysts.A diagnosis of Dieterich's disease was madeand initial conservative treatment was given for 3months. Curettage of the lesion and autologous cancellous bone grafting from ipsilateral distal radius was done after failed conservative treatment. The patient was symptom free in up to 1-year follow-up."
