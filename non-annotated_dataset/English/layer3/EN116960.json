  "text": "A 33-year-old Chinese Han man underwent small bowel resection leaving only 40 cm of bowel, without an ileocecal valve, 12 years previously. At that time he was weaned from total parenteral nutrition and had a normal diet. He later developed features of severe malnutrition, and when parenteral nutrition was given, he developed re-feeding syndrome."
