  "text": "We report a rare case of fulminant hepatic failure in a 36-year-old gravida 2 black woman of African descent that occurred at 17 weeks gestation following propylthiouracil treatment for Graves' disease. Her liver failure was managed by liver transplantation and thyroidectomy. Her pregnancy was continued to term, though with not so favorable early childhood sequelae."
