  "text": "A 25 year old male presented to orthopaedic causality with injury to right ankle following a road traffic accident. Patient complained of severe pain and deformity of ankle following injury. On examination ankle was deformed and swollen. Plain radiographs of right ankle joint revealed total anterolateral dislocation of talus without any accompanying ankle fracture. CT scan with 3D reconstruction also confirmed our radiographic findings. Under spinal anaesthesia and fluoroscopic guidance closed reduction was performed. To maintain reduction a 3mm K-wire was passed from calcaneum to tibia through talus. A posterior below knee splint was applied. Patient was followed every three months till one year. At one year follow up patient had good range of motion at ankle and subtalar joint."
