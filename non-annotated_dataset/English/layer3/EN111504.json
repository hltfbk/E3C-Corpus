  "text": "A 39-year-old man presented with a 1-mo history of upper abdominal discomfort. His concomitant symptoms were abdominal distension, postprandial nausea, and vomiting. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen showed thickening of the intestinal wall with enhancement of the descending segment of the duodenum, which could not be clearly differentiated from the head of the pancreas. Upper gastrointestinal radiographs and gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a complete obstruction of the descending duodenum. An operation found that a 3-cm mass was located in the \"groove part\" of the pancreas and oppressing the descending duodenum. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed to relieve the obstruction and thoroughly remove the pancreatic lesions. The pathologic diagnosis was pancreatitis. The patient had an uneventful recovery with no complications."
