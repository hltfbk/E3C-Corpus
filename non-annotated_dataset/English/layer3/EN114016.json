  "text": "We report a rare case of a 40-year-old male with a left foot plantar swelling of 4 months duration with no discharging sinuses, fever, and pain. There was no history of trauma or barefoot walking. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were suggestive of a soft-tissue malignancy. The mass was excised and sent for histopathology. Histopathology reported it as a mycetoma. Complete resolution was seen after 3 months of antifungal treatment and excision of the mass. This was unusual since there were no discharging sinuses, nodules, and even MRI reported as a fibrous or muscular mass. The diagnosis was made only after a histopathological examination."
