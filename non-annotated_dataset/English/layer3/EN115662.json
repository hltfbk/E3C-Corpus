  "text": "Case 1. A 64-year-old Japanese woman with a chordoma at her sacrum presented with pain in her left leg and claudication. Though operations, radiation therapy and GS-TAE (gelatin sponge-transarterial embolization, via the L5 lumbar artery) were performed, the size of the tumor leading pain and claudication increased. RFA was performed for the sacral tumor, and these symptoms resolved one year after the procedure. Case 2. A 68-year-old Japanese man with a leiomyosarcoma at the apex of left lung presented with pain and motor function disorders of the left upper limb. Dissemination in the pleura was appeared after the operation for a leiomyosarcoma at the mediastinum. Though radiation therapy and a second operation were performed, the tumor at the apex of the left lung increased and pain and numbness of the left upper limb were appeared after the second operation. RFA was performed for the left lung tumor, and the symptoms resolved 3 months after RFA."
