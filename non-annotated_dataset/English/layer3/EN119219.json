  "text": "Three years after undergoing anterior resection of the rectum, a 75-year-old man presented with symptoms of small bowel obstruction. Plain abdominal radiography and CT showed a radio-opaque marker; a foreign body was suspected, probably a piece of retained surgical gauze. An ileotomy of about 5 cm. was performed to confirm this diagnosis and remove the gauze."
