  "text": "We describe a case of a 74-year-old Chinese man who was diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to the pancreas and subcutaneous tissue at the same time, 10â€‰years after left radical nephrectomy. He received distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation plus resection of the subcutaneous tissue lesions on the left side of the anterior abdominal wall and right waist. Pathology showed that all resected metastatic tumors were of the clear cell type. The patient was seen in regular follow-up afterward."
