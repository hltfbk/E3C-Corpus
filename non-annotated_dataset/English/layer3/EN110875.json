  "text": "The patient was a 78-year-old man who presented to the hospital with dysphagia. A diverticulum was detected in the lower part of his esophagus by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. HRM was performed to investigate esophageal motility disorders. His integrated relaxation pressure was normal at 25.9 (< 26) mmHg, but his distal contractile integral (DCI) was very high at 21,464 (1500-13,000) mmHg s cm. Esophageal peristalsis was preserved. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as having an epiphrenic esophageal diverticulum derived from a jackhammer esophagus for which laparoscopic transhiatal diverticulectomy and Heller-Dor procedure were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. His symptoms improved, and the level of DCI also returned to a normal level of 3867 mmHg s cm at 2 months after the operation."
