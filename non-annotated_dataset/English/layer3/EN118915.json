  "text": "We present a case of LCA that was discovered incidentally in a 52-year-old woman who presented with biliary colic at the time of consultation for cholecystectomy. This vascular neoplasm was evaluated by ultrasound, CT, MRI, Tc-99m labelled red blood cell scintigraphy, and core biopsy. A splenectomy revealed LCA by pathological evaluation. Post-operative outcome was favourable with no evidence of complication or recurrent disease. Following this case presentation, clinical, radiographic, and pathological features of LCA will be reviewed as well as recent advances in our understanding of this uncommon splenic lesion."
