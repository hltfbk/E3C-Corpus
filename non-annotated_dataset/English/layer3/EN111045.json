  "text": "A 64-year-old woman was undergoing follow-up for primary aldosteronism. In 2012, follow-up computed tomography (CT) incidentally revealed a 7-mm cystic lesion in segment 8 of the liver. From 2012 to 2017, the cystic lesion kept increasing in size, reaching 17 mm. In 2017, CT also revealed a 13-mm mural nodule in the cyst wall. Therefore, the patient was referred to our department for possible malignancy. We suspected a branch-type IPNB; however, the mass was small and diagnosis could not be made without performing biopsy. Accordingly, surgical resection was performed for diagnosis and treatment. Because branch-type IPNB might show horizontal spread through the intrahepatic bile duct, we believed that anatomical resection of the liver was appropriate considering the malignant potential of the lesion. Therefore, laparoscopic anatomical resection of segment 8 of the liver was performed. The resected tumor measured 17 mm and was histologically diagnosed as a high-grade IPNB."
