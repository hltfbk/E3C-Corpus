  "text": "A 45-year-old female patient received docetaxel treatment after resection of a breast carcinoma. Funduscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed cystoid macular edema on both eyes. Dilated funduscopy also showed bone spicule-like pigmented deposits, typical for retinitis pigmentosa. Besides the fundus appearance restricted peripheral vision and scotopic electroretinogram confirmed the diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa. Chemotherapy was discontinued following a consulation with the oncologist of the patient. After five weeks, visual acuity improved significantly along with decrease of retinal thickness measured by OCT."
