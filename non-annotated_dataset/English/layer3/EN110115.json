  "text": "A 45- year-old previously healthy woman presented with a 9- months history of right radicular leg pain. No precipitating factor to the pain was identified, and there was no history of excessive motion or sports before the onset of clinical symptoms. The pain had become significantly worse during walking in the several days before presentation. On admission; physical examination showed a positive straight leg raising at 65Â° without motor or sensitive deficit. Sphincter function and the left side were normal. CT showed vacuum phenomenon with moderat disc protrusion at L5-S1 space, and gas bubble in the right anterolateral portion of the epidural space at this level. Epidural gas accumulation was compressing the dural sac and right S1 nerve root. The pain was severe and failed to respond to conservative therapy including analgesics, anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxant drugs. An ipsilateral L5-S1 interlaminar approach was performed with enlargement of the lateral recess. The S1 root appeared swollen and compressed by the adjacent pseudo-cyst that was removed. Histological study revealed no specific fibrous tissue. One year after this operation, the patient remains free of pain."
