  "text": "A 9 year old girl had an extensive biventricular calcification which is caused by multiple factors including multiple organ failure (heart, lung, liver, and kidney), aseptic cardiomyopathy, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, pulmonary hemorrhage, viral encephalitis. In this case study, the massive myocardial calcification present in the patient was classified as dystrophic. After the patient was transferred to the Intensive care unit, a series of rescue treatments such as anti-inflammatory factor storm were implemented to protect the organs. In the end, the patient was rescued from the rescue treatment procedure. After 18â€‰months of follow-up, it was observed that the patient's heart function returned to normal and it was observed that there was no change in myocardial calcification in the patient."
