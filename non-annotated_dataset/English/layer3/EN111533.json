  "text": "The patient was a 38-year old woman diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus 5 years ago, who was admitted to a general educational hospital in northern Iran due to intensified rheumatologic symptoms and complaining about abdominal pain. Cyclosporine tab were administered to the patient, 50 mg twice daily. Two weeks after the administration of cyclosporine, the level of blood cyclosporine was checked. The patient became bradycardic after starting a single dose of venlafaxine (heart rate 52 ppm). Cardiac assessment showed no reason for bradycardia and it subsided after a drop of venlafaxine."
