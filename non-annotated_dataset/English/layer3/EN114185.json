  "text": "Hereby, we present a rare case of a female patient who developed \"full-blown\" acute ascending aortic dissection (Stanford type A-DeBakey type II dissection) with intramural hematoma during an elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of the right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery (LCA). Accordingly, emergent surgical repair of the dissected aorta was performed including grafting of supracoronary ascending aortic tube, along with coronary artery bypass graft placement and septal myomectomy for severely hypertrophied cardiac septum. The patient recovered successfully without any documented postoperative complications."
