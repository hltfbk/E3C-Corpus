  "text": "We report a case of a 20-year-old white man with an immature teratoma who presented with progressive exertional dyspnea. During a cardiac examination, an ejection systolic murmur was observed, and echocardiography findings at an Emergency Centre revealed high velocity flow at the level of the pulmonary artery, indicating pulmonary stenosis. He was hospitalized in our Cardiology Department for further investigation. A chest X-ray revealed a mediastinal mass, and repeated echocardiography indicated the presence of a large mediastinal mass compressing his main pulmonary artery. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the tumor in the mediastinum, and a histopathological diagnosis of immature teratoma was established following biopsy."
