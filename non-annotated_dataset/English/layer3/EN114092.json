  "text": "We describe a 2-year-old beagle dog presented for progressive attacks of muscular rigidity and lordosis with superimposed spasms of the appendicular muscles triggered by tactile stimulation which resulted in marked gait impairment. Resting electromyography revealed continuous motor unit activity in the axial musculature. Compared to age-matched healthy beagle dogs, this patient had elevated glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid."
