  "text": "The current case report presents a pregnant woman who was referred to our emergency department with bilateral femoral open fracture. After detecting fetal demise by abdominopelvic ultrasound, an area of fat density in right external iliac vein was detected in abdominopelvic contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan which was considered as the probable diagnosis of fat embolism. While the patient did not show signs and symptoms of FES, the fat embolism was confirmed in further evaluations."
