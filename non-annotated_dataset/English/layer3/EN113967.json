  "text": "We present 3 patients with cutaneous melanomas, treated with similar fields of surgical security. Current issues, generated within the framework of melanoma's surgery guided by the recommendations of the AJCC are also discussed. A new surgical approach in patients with melanoma is recommended, discussed for the first time in world literature. We hypothesize that the introduction of a certain recommendations for a 2 cm surgical field in all directions during the initial excision, combined with the parallel performance of a sentinel lymph node biopsy, will lead in fact to several important advantages: 1) avoiding of the secondary excision in at least 70% - 90% of the patients (depending on the tumor thickness), 2) minimizing the risk of lymphatic effusion change and misinterpretation of the sentinel lymph node biopsy's results in patients with secondary excision; 3) optimization of the surgical team's work; 4) minimizing the possibility of unprepared/uninformed personnel to take part in decisions for treating a specific disease such as skin melanoma, 4) facilitating the appropriate patients' group selection at the appropriate stage when involving them in different studies, leading to equal leveling of the initial positions."
