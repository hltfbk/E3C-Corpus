  "text": "A 9-year old boy presented to the pediatric department with chronic right knee pain and swelling which had increased during the previous 3 months. There was no history of recent skin or other infections, trauma, fever, or constitutional symptoms or signs. His medical history and family history were non contributory.\nA physical examination revealed tenderness and swelling over the patella. The patient had a full, active range of knee movement. Radiographs of the right knee showed an osteolytic lesion involving the hole patella. Endosteal scalloping and cortical thinning with mild expansion and a multi-loculated appearance was observed. Sagittal CT scan images showed a multi-loculated lesion in the patella. An open bone biopsy of the patella with intraoperative frozen section was performed. The soft tissues appeared normal, but a thin anterior cortex of the patella was seen and punctured with an elevator. After removal of a large window of thin cortical bone, a large well-defined cavity filled with serosanguinous fluid was found. A rim of tissue that lined the cavity and curettings from within the cavity were sent for histologic analysis. The bony rim was scle¬rotic and intact. The posterior wall of the cavity was cartilaginous, but the patellar cartilage revealed no obvious violation of the joint surface. There was no evidence of malignancy. Intraoperative Gram stain and cultures were negative. The lesion was diagnosed as a bone cyst pending histologic analysis. Based on these intraoperative findings, the lesion was completely curetted. The periphery of the cavity was cauterized and then burred. The defect was packed with autologous iliac graft. Histopathologic examination of the biopsy material revealed empty spaces outlined by thin septa made of spindle cells, randomly scattered benign giant cells, and capillaries in a collagenous matrix. The septa were made of fibrous connective tissue containing fine strands of imma¬ture woven bone. Fiber osteoid was observed in some septa. There were no mitoses or atypical cells. These histologic findings were consistent with an aneurysmal bone cyst. Ten months after intralesional curettage and bone grafting, our patient returned to full activities without pain. He has regained full range of motion of his knee."
