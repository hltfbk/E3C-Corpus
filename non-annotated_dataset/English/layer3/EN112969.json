  "text": "We describe a male patient suffering a swelling and erosive, enlarged, and hardened abdominal wall mass with pain due to abdominal wall accessory breast cancer. The patient had no obvious disease history, and the initial clinical symptom was a small mass on the abdominal wall. B-ultrasound revealed a solid subcutaneous nodule in the right abdomen with a size of ~2.8 × 2.5 × 1.5 cm. The abdominal wall tumor resection was performed with local anesthesia. Pathological testing revealed a grade II infiltrating ductal carcinoma derived from the accessory mammary gland (right abdominal wall) with neuroendocrine characteristics, showing ER (100% strong positive), PR (100% strong positive), HER-2 (-), ki67 (40% positive), Syn (+), CgA (+), and GCDFP15 (+)."
