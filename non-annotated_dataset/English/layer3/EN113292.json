  "text": "A 61-year-old Caucasian man presented with rapidly progressive paralysis of the IX, X, XI and XII right cranial nerves associated with right central facial nerve palsy. Brain computed tomography angiography and cerebral catheter angiography found a focal fusiform enlargement of the distal cervical portion of the right internal carotid artery, related to a pseudo-aneurysm suggesting an evolution of a dissection and intra-cranial vessel dysplasia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple asymmetrical subcortical regions of hyperintensity on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Punctiform cortical hyposignals on T2-weighted gradient echo magnetic resonance imaging sequences were mostly congruent with the white matter hyperintensities. There was a decreased cerebral perfusion at the frontal hyperintense fluid-attenuated inversion recovery region. Spectrometry identified a lactate-lipid peak. A brain biopsy showed intravascular amyloid deposits. Corticosteroid therapy was initiated, leading to a dramatic improvement of both clinical condition and magnetic resonance imaging brain lesions."
