  "text": "A 34-year-old man with dizziness, asthma, and inability to swallow for four days referred to the hospital emergency department. He had diplopia and ptosis for two days. During admission to the emergency, the patient was conscious without fever, but with dysarthria and bilateral ptosis, an impaired gag reflex, slow right papillary reaction to light, a decreased eye movement, and a decreased power of facial muscles and limbs. The patient reported the use of clay cheese in a week before referring to the emergency. Hematological, biochemical, electrocardiogram, magnetic resonance imaging, and chest X-ray assays were normal. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification, these symptoms were related to botulism. The evaluation of serum samples, emission, and gastric juice confirmed botulism by type A toxin."
