  "text": "The case of a 92-year-old, caucasian, female patient presenting with symptoms of small bowel obstruction secondary to an incarcerated left sided obturator hernia is presented. An incarcerated segment of the small bowel was reduced during emergency laparoscopy. Intraoperative ICG fluorescence angiography revealed ischaemic changes in the normal appearing bowel, so that the involved segment was resected. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home safely on postoperative day seven."
