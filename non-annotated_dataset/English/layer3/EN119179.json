  "text": "The clinical and the radiographic manifestations of melorheostosis have been encountered in a 41-year-old man. Mutations in the 13 exons and flanking intronic regions of the LEMD3-gene have not been detected. His phenotypic features were consistent but not completely diagnostic for tricho-dento-osseous syndrome (TDO). We report what might be a novel syndromic association."
