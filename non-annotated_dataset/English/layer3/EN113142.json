  "text": "We present the first case of a Bulgarian patient with a histologically confirmed primary cutaneous T-cell CD30+/ALK- large anaplastic cell lymphoma-cALCL (therapeutically resistant to therapy with Methotrexate, radiation therapy and systemic corticosteroid therapy) who was successfully treated with Brentuximab vedotin. In several years, the patient has developed a comparatively fast skin progression as well as an initial systemic one which impacts inguinal and mediastinal nodes. After the implementation of 4 therapy cycles with Brentuximab vedotin, complete regression of the described by previous hospitalisations lymph nodes as well as 80% reduction of the cutaneous and subcutaneous located tumour formations were observed."
