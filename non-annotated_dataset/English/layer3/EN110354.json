  "text": "A 63-year-old man with a 3 year history of hypertension, presented with a firm mass in the right hemiscrotum. This lesion had appeared four years previously.\nOn local examination, à 4 centimeters mass was noted on the right scrotum, the left testis, both epididymis and the spermatic cords were normal to palpation, while the inguinal nodes were not palpable. Mass excision was performed by another surgeon. Pathologic examination revealed a léiomyosarcome of the scrotum, the nodule was well defined and consisted of a proliferation of cells with cigar-shaped nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm, the mitotic count was high. The cells stained positive for actin and H-Caldesmon on immunohistochemestry and were negative for desmin. Resected margins were positive. The patient was referred to our department; he was then evaluated for distant metastatic spread with a total body CT scan that showed no distant metastasis. Wide excision around the scar of the previous excision was performed. Definitive histology showed the absence of tumor on the latter specimen. No recurrence has been recognized 40 months after."
