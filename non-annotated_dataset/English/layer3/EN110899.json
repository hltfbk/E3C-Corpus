  "text": "Of the total 136 patients who underwent hepatectomies for hepatocellular carcinoma in our institution, three patients with prior hepatectomies and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma had tumor thrombi in the inferior vena cava, right atrium, and phrenic vein. Surgical resections were performed, as there was a possibility of sudden death, despite the risk of leaving residual tumor. For all patients, we performed resection of the tumor thrombi in the inferior vena cava and right atrium and combined diaphragm resection. Surgical resection was performed using the total hepatic vascular exclusion technique in all cases. Additional passive veno-venous bypass was also performed in two cases, in which complete tumor resections could not be achieved. The microscopic surgical margins of the combined resected diaphragms were positive in all cases. Progression-free survival was 20.2, 3.8, and 9.5 months for case 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The respective overall postoperative survival was 98.0, 38.9, and 30.9 months. The patients died due to liver cirrhosis, acute heart failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Sudden death did not occur for any of the patients."
