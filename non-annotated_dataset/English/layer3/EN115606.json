  "text": "A 20-year-old Caucasian man presented to our Department to solve a dental anomaly of his upper central incisors. An oral investigation revealed the fusion of his maxillary central incisors and dyschromia of right central incisor. Vitality pulp tests were negative for lateral upper incisors and left central incisor. Radiographic examinations showed a fused tooth with two separate pulp chambers, two distinct roots and two separate root canals. There were also periapical lesions of central incisors and right lateral incisor, so he underwent endodontic treatment. Six months later, OPT examination revealed persistence of the periapical radiolucency, so endodontic surgery was performed, which included exeresis of the lesion, an apicoectomy and retrograde obturation with a reinforced zinc oxide-eugenol cement (SuperEBA) Complete healing of the lesion was obtained six months postoperatively. Fused teeth crowns were separated and orthodontic appliances were put in place. When correct teeth position was achieved (after nine months), the anterior teeth were prosthetically rehabilitated."
