  "text": "A 37-year-old Japanese woman had an approximate 5-cm anterior mediastinal mass detected by chest imaging. The resected lesion revealed multilocular thymic cysts that were filled with colloid-like material. Histology showed lymph follicular hyperplasia with many epithelial cysts. The epithelium consisted of thymic medullary epithelium, and no epithelial proliferation was seen in the lymphoid tissue. Lymphocytes were composed of an organized mixed population of mature T and B cells without significant atypia. The infiltrated B cells did not reveal light chain restriction or immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. After the pathological diagnosis of thymic lesion, tests for the presence of autoantibodies were positive for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatic factor, and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. The Schirmer's, chewing gum, and Saxon tests showed decreased salivary and lacrimal secretion. Lip biopsy showed focal lymphocytic sialadenitis. The signs and symptoms of Sj√∂gren syndrome had not resolved, without aggravation, 1 year after the thymectomy."
