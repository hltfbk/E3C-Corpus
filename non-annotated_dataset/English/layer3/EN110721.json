  "text": "We present a treatment flow of a 9-year-old patient, diagnosed with an obstructive hydrocephalus due to tectal glioma that was successfully treated with an ETV. We review the important factors influencing the success rate such as age, aetiology, shunt history, preoperative planning and visualisation of the basilar artery."
