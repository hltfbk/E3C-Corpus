  "text": "An 87 year old female presented as outpatient in family medicine with nocturnal leg cramps which had been present for five years and increasingly burdened her quality of life. She had been using quinine 200 mg once daily for symptomatic relief but the cramps kept returning with increasing intensity. During clinical examination we found neither structural nor neurological or metabolic disorders that explained her symptoms. When doing a medication analysis, we found that she was taking a statin together with quinine. Quinine is a cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 inhibitor, the very enzyme which is involved in the metabolism of most statins. Therefore the use of both substances simultaneously increases blood levels of the statin thereby increasing the risk of side effects including symptomatic myopathy and myalgia. After discontinuing both medications, the patient was, and remained, symptom free."
