  "text": "We present the case of a 42-year-old female patient previously diagnosed with Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, who had sustained a left femoral shaft fracture. She was treated with a closed, locked intramedullary nailing procedure. The nail was peripherally locked free-hand with a single screw due to the increased vascularity and intraoperative haemorrhage of the area. The patient was transfused with 7 units of blood intra-operatively and was subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where 3 more units of blood were transfused. Her post-operative course was uneventful. One year following the operation the fracture had united and the patient remained well."
