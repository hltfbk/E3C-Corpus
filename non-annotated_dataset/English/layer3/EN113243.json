  "text": "A 6Â year old girl presented during the first year of life with severe renal Fanconi as the first manifestation of ARC-Syndrome. This case presents all defining features of ARC syndrome (including liver, skin and articular manifestations) with predominantly renal impairment at presentation. This novel mutation may be associated with a pronounced renal phenotype in ARC. Furthermore, we report on the successful use of LDL-Apheresis and biliodigestive derivation for treatment of cholestatic pruritus with encouraging results."
