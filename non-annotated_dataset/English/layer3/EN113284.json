  "text": "A 15-year-old male children admitted to the emergency department with swelling, pain, and limitation of elbow range of motion after falling off a horse. Plain radiographs of the elbow revealed incongruity and increase in joint space of the elbow. When looked at carefully the medial epicondyle was seen not in the anatomic position but in the joint.Urgent surgery was performed. The medial epicondyle was removed from the joint and fixed its position with a 4 mm diameter cannulated lag screw, under fluoroscopy control. Then, the tear of the origin of flexor muscle groups on medial epicondyle was repaired with a 5.5 mm suture anchor."
