  "text": "We present a rare case of fungal osteomyelitis of right second toe in a 30 year old Indian female who presented with swelling of 8 months duration. Diagnosis was based on the histo-pathological report and culture showing Aspergillus growth. The patient was treated with surgical debridement and amphotericin-B was given for 6 weeks after debridement. There was no recurrence one year post surgery."
