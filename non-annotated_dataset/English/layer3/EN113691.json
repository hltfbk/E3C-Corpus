  "text": "A 16-year-old patient with no medical history had a road accident. Clinical evaluation found an incomplete tetraplegia.The imaging has revealed an atlo-axoidal dislocation with aspinal cord compression. Furthermore, radiological exams relvealed an odentoideum bone. A transcranial traction by a Gardner stirrup was set for 15 days to obtain a progressive reduction of the displacement. A full neurological recovery (FB-FD) was obtained.The patient was then operated to stabilize the reduction. A C1-C2 posterior zygapophyseal arthrodesis was performed. An autograft harvested from the iliac crest was used. Complementary open reduction and fixation of the cervico-occipital hinge was made using lamellar hooks and compression rods. At the 18-month follow-up, the clinical examination found no neurological deficiency and the plain radiography showed a complete fusion of the arthrodesis."
