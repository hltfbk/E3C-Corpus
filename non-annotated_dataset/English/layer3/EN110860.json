  "text": "We report an unusual case of a 39-year-old diabetic male who presented with epigastric pain and oliguria. Work-up showed elevated serum creatinine, potassium, and calcium-phosphate product, and metabolic acidosis. The patient was admitted in the intensive care unit and received emergent renal replacement therapy. Kidney biopsy revealed tubular cell injury with transparent crystal casts positive for Von Kossa staining, which established the diagnosis of APN."
