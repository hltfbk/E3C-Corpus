  "text": "A 34-year-old female, with a surgical history of duodenal obstruction due to annular pancreas in the neonatal period, was referred to our hospital for further examination of chronic pancreatitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed choledocholithiasis, pancreatic lithiasis, and pancreaticobiliary maljunction without biliary dilatation. Choledocholithotomy and cholecystectomy were performed, and highly elevated levels of amylase in bile from the common bile duct were found intraoperatively."
