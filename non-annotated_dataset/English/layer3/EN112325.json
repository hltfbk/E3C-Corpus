  "text": "A 67-year-old man, treated with eltrombopag due to chronic ITP, was admitted due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Although coronary angiography revealed no occlusion, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging suggested a myocardial infarction in the territory of the left circumflex coronary artery. Three months after the ACS event, the obtuse marginal branches exhibited significant stenosis; hence, a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed to implant a zotarolimus-eluting stent under the treatment of a dual antiplatelet therapy. However, stent thrombosis occurred 3 hours after PCI and required three other PCIs during the eltrombopag treatment."
