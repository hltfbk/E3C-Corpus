  "text": "We report a case of a 23-year-old man with long-standing severe Crohn's disease which necessitated subtotal colectomy. He subsequently developed progressive, intermittent back pain that were limiting his functional movement. Numerous investigations to identify what initially was thought to be an infectious process failed to lead to the diagnosis. Biopsy of the spine identified a sterile neutrophilic infiltrate and the diagnosis of chronic recurrent multi-focal osteomyelitis was made which was successfully treated with immunosuppressive drugs."
