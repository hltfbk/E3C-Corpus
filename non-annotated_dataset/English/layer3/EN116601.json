  "text": "A 40-year-old man presented with right testicular swelling for past three months. The swelling was painless, hard and rubbery. Testicular ultrasound showed diffuse increase in size of the testicle, with alteration in its echogenicity. The patient underwent orchidectomy, and based on histopathological and immunohistochemical tests, a peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified was diagnosed."
