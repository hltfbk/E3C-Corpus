  "text": "It consists in a 47 years old female patient, who has been followed up since the age of 31 years for bilateral galactorrhea and a spaniomenorrhea. There has been no associated drug intake. Her exploration has showed a serum prolactin level of 635 mIU /L. Thyroid test results were normal T4 = 10,2ng/L and TSH = 1.76 mIU/L. A brain scan has showed an empty sella turcica.\nDespite the unchanged levels of prolactinemia, the evolution under dopaminergic 5 mg /D has been marked by the occurrence of a pregnancy with persistent moderate hyperprolactinemia in the postpartum. The patient has had menopause at the age of 47, with elevated gonadotrophins FSH = 78 mIU/mL, LH = 33 mIU/mL and estradiol: 35 pg/mL.\nChromatography has showed a predominance of the macroprolactin form with: Prolactin monomer at 4.8%, Big Prolactin at 5% and Big Big Prolactin at 83%. After the discovery of the macroprolactinemia, we decided to stop bromocriuptin treatment. The clinical evolution of the patient is favorable without drugs intake. Abbreviations : PRL: Prolactin ; FSH: Follicle-stimulating Hormone; LH: luteinizing hormone."
