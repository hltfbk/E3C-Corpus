  "text": "A 70-year-old Asian male patient with history of stable HIV on medications with CD 4â€‰cell count above 200 presented with cough and fever and was initially treated for pneumonia as an outpatient. Persisting symptoms prompted presentation to the hospital. The patient was found to have anemia which persisted despite repeated transfusion of packed red cells. A bone marrow biopsy to investigate anemia revealed hemophagocytosis. A CT scan revealed multiple enlarged lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly. An excisional lymph node biopsy revealed HHV-8 associated multicentric Castleman disease. The patient deteriorated despite initiation of treatment."
