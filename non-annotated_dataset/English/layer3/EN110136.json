  "text": "A 56-year-old man was admitted to our dermatology department on November 2011 for the onset of a three-month history of erythroderma associated with weight loss, asthenia and chronic diarrhea. He was a heavy smoker, with no past medical history. The physical examination on admission revealed generalized itchy, erythematous and scaling lesions on the face, trunk, and extremities predominantly on the extensor surfaces, associated with palmo-plantar keratoderma. The biological assessment revealed a biological inflammatory syndrome with an accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 85 mm, hypergammaglobulinemia at 16g/l, inflammatory anemia at 8.9 g/dl with hypereosinophilia ranging from 2500 to 3600 E/mm 3 and hyper IgE serum level reaching 13932 U/ml. Cutaneous biopsies showed focal acanthosis and focal parakeratosis, hypogranulosis, with mild dermal perivascular infiltrate consisting mainly of lymphocytes and some eosinophils. Tumor markers showed only mildly elevated carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA). A thoracic, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography showed a left hilar mass of 6 cm with micronodules of the left upper lobe without any other metastatic lesions. A stenotic infiltration of the culmen was found on the bronchial fibroscopy. The biopsy of this infiltration showed a bronchogenic epidermoid carcinoma. This diagnosis was confirmed by the histological analysis when the patient underwent a left pneumonectomy. The clinical course was characterized by a complete healing of the cutaneous lesions and a regression of the hyper eosinophilia and IgE. One year later the patient died due to the recurrence of his cancer."
