  "text": "A 50-year-old woman presented with a gradually increasing swelling over hard palate for 2 years. She was a hypertensive patient and mishri user (using tobacco-containing teeth cleaning powder) with known diabetes. She had undergone a teeth extraction 2 years ago. The palatine swelling was reddish-blue, sessile with a lobulated surface, firm in consistency, and non-tender with a of size 4Ã—3 cm. The computed tomography (CT) scan revealed bony dehiscence of the underlying palate. Histopathological examination after excision and curettage was suggestive of LCH."
