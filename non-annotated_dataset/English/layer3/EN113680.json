  "text": "Our patient is a 66-year-old Chinese female admitted with a 24-h history of acute right knee pain and swelling with associated fever in the context of consuming raw fish porridge 3 days before the onset of her symptoms. She had a TKR performed in the same knee 7 years before this presentation. Her GBS PJI was confirmed on both blood and intraoperative tissue/fluid cultures during the outbreak of GBS infections in Singapore. This was managed with debridement, polyethylene liner change, retention of metal prosthesis, and culture-directed antibiotics with good outcomes."
