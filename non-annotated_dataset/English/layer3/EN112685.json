  "text": "An 8-year-old boy presented with left periorbital pain for a week. His visual acuity and eye movement were normal. There was point tenderness on palpitation over the left trochlear region without swelling or redness. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging showed focal enhancement on the left trochlea and paranasal sinusitis on the left side. The patient's symptoms and signs were completely resolved after empirical treatment for sinusitis. There was no need to inject a local steroid."
