  "text": "Herein, we present a 77-year-old male patient with a 7-month-history of unrecognized cutaneous manifestations on his left shoulder and flank. Based on the investigations, the diagnosis of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia was established. We applied cryotherapy as a treatment of choice. The complete regression of the skin lesions and three years disease-free period was achieved."
