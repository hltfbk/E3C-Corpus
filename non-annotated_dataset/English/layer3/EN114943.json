  "text": "The authors present a 74 years old European female patient without previous diagnosis of sarcoidosis who presented with pain in the area of the jaw angles. There were no further clinical symptoms. Bone biopsy following radiological investigation demonstrated non-caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis of the bone. Further evaluation confirmed multi-organ disease with involvement of lungs, intrathoracic lymph nodes, and the central nervous system."
