  "text": "A 31-month-old girl was admitted to our pediatric emergency room because of a necrotizing soft tissue infection of the left axillary area. The infection progressed rapidly and resulted in septic shock. Despite a medical treatment and surgical debridement, the sepsis was not controlled, and severe inflammation developed. After applying of negative-pressure wound therapy, her clinical symptoms improved. Finally, she was diagnosed with cyclic neutropenia with a novel genetic mutation. One month after admission, she was discharged with a completely recovered wound and no need for skin grafting."
