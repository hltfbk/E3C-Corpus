  "text": "We report a 13-year-old patient with an atypical variant of PS without any limb anomalies. In view of the good function of the upper limb, no surgical treatment was offered, and the patient and his family were counseled regarding the condition. A follow-up of the patient at 2 years revealed that the patient is still asymptomatic with good functional status of the upper limb."
