  "text": "We report a case presented in deep hypoglycemic coma during his treatment with propranolol for IH. Through our case report and the review of the literature, we aimed to underline the importance of recognizing adverse effects during propranolol therapy. Although propranolol has a long history of safe and effective use in infants and children, pediatricians should be aware that life-threatening adverse effects can happen during propranolol therapy for IH."
