  "text": "A 29-year-old gentleman had bilateral posterior fracture-dislocation of shoulders, with comminuted three-part fractures of both humeral heads, after two episodes of seizures, following CSVT. Unlike posterior fracture-dislocation secondary to any other causes, patients with CSVT are usually intensive care unit bound and have low Glasgow coma scale, in a state of inability to complain, causing a delay in diagnosis and chances of delay in treatment due to the concomitant treatment of CSVT. This patient was treated in coordination with the neurologists and operated by bilateral open reduction and internal fixation using proximal humerus locking plates and greater tuberosity reconstruction. 2 years post-operatively, the patient had painless shoulders, with satisfactory and functional range of motion."
