  "text": "A 46-year-old Javanese woman presented with urinary incontinence following an abdominal hysterectomy 3 months earlier and received laparoscopic repair. A cystoscopy was performed to confirm the fistula orifice and a stent was inserted into the fistula tract from her bladder to her vagina. A tamponade was inserted into her vagina up to the vaginal apex, to be able to identify the vagina. She had adhesions; therefore, adhesiolysis was performed using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection to expose the vaginal stump and the superior aspect of her bladder. A simple cystotomy was performed and extended to include the fistulae site, and then the defect was repaired by using a running stitch. A second layer of closure was performed in an imbricating fashion with the same suture. The vagina defect was not closed separately but covered with an omental flap. This procedure takes approximately 2.5 hours; estimated blood loss was minimal and there were no intraoperative complications. She had no recurrent symptoms 6 months after surgery."
