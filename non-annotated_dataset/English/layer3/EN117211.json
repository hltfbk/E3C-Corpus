  "text": "A 40-year-old Indian woman presented with a breast mass which was diagnosed as osteosarcoma of the breast on biopsy. Our patient was treated with a simple mastectomy after excluding the presence of skeletal primary and extra-mammary metastases. Final pathology showed a cystosarcoma phyllodes with signs of osteogenic sarcoma."
