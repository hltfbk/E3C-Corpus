  "text": "A 65-year-old woman was diagnosed as having multiple mRCC and intercurrent, locally advanced BDC. A single course of combination therapy with sunitinib (25 mg/day, day2-15) and gemcitabine (750 mg/m(2), days 1, 8) was administered, and this showed obvious effects, with partial response for mRCC and stable disease for BDC. However, the patient also experienced severe adverse events, including hematological and various non-hematological toxicities; the combination therapy was then terminated on day 13 after its initiation. She recovered on day 28 and is alive 3.5 years after the diagnosis. The plasma trough levels of sunitinib and its active metabolite SU12662 on day 13 were 91.5 ng/mL and 19.2 ng/mL, respectively, which were relatively higher than in previous reports. Analysis of her single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected TC in ABCB1 3435C/T, TC in 1236C/T and TT in 2677G/T, suggesting a possible TTT haplotype."
