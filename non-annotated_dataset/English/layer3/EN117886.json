  "text": "67 years old male patient suffered a fatal bleeding from Dieulafoy-like lesion located at the mouth of the periampullary diverticulum. Initial endoscopic therapy and radiologic embolization failed to stop the bleeding, while direct observation and hemoclipping by the side viewing endoscopy successfully established correct diagnosis and permanent cure of the lesion."
