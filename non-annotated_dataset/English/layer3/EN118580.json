  "text": "We report a case of a 35 year old man who presented with anginal pain and hypertension. He was found to have a cardiac mass on the computed tomographic scan and echocardiogram. He underwent surgical exploration of the mass which on biopsy was found to be a 'Cardiac Paraganglioma'. Surgical resection of the tumor was successfully done and the patient is doing well five years after the surgery without any evidence of recurrence. His blood pressure, however, failed to normalize and needed single agent antihypertensive therapy."
