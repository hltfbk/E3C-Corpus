  "text": "We describe the case of a 26-year-old African American woman with systemic sarcoidosis, with a unique constellation of renal lesions, including noncaseating epithelioid granulomatous necrotizing interstitial nephritis, cellular crescent formation, and necrotizing vasculitis. Immunosuppressive therapy was helpful for alleviating her nephrotic syndrome and maintaining the stability of her renal function over a 30-month period."
