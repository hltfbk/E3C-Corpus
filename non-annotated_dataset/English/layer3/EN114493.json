  "text": "A 58-year-old Tanzanian chagga by tribe with a body mass index of 28 kg/m(2) and newly diagnosed type II diabetes presented with polydipsia and involuntary movements of the right upper limb for 4 days. His plasma glucose was 549 mg/dl and glycated haemoglobin was 18.9 %. His movements were exaggerated by attempts to use his right hand. The rest of his neurological assessment was unremarkable. Other laboratory findings including calcium were within the normal range. A computed tomography scan of the brain was essentially normal except for age-related atrophy. There was no significant ketonuria on urine dipstick testing. We treated the patient's hyperglycaemia with intravenous insulin and the dystonia disappeared within 5 days."
