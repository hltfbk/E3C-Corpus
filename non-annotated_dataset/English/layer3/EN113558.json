  "text": "Here, we report an extremely rare case in which HCC metastasized to the capsule of an undescended testis in the right inguinal area of the patient. A tumor approximately 8.8 × 7.0 cm in size was found in the patient's liver during a health check-up. Initially, it was considered a metastatic tumor because the patient was found to have cryptorchidism, which had been left untreated before he presented to our hospital. The patient underwent a radical orchiectomy via inguinal approach, and the resected testis in the right inguinal region was examined via microscopy. The cancer cells were arranged in nests and showed abundant red or clear cytoplasm and marked nuclear atypia. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the tumor cells were positive for CK, CK8/18, AFP, hepatocyte, GCP3, but negative for PLAP, CD10, CD30, CD34, and vimentin."
