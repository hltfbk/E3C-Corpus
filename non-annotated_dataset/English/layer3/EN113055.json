  "text": "A 55-year-old woman was brought by ambulance to our hospital with complaints of sudden-onset dysarthria and left arm numbness. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 5, and the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score was 8. She was diagnosed with acute embolic stroke. At 4 h, 6 min after onset, intravenous administration of rt-PA (alteplase, 0.6 mg/kg) was started. Her neurological deficits improved rapidly, and her NIHSS score was 1. Brain MRI was then performed. There was no hemorrhagic transformation, but the MRI findings were not compatible with ischemic stroke. She had a past history of RA diagnosed 6 months earlier, and she had been treated with methotrexate (10 mg daily). She was diagnosed with RMSA, and continuous infusion of methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily was started for 3 days. The high signal intensity on the FLAIR image disappeared."
