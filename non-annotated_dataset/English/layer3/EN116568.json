  "text": "A 42-year-old Caucasian man complained of a sudden headache and nausea-vomiting. The patient rapidly deteriorated to coma. An emergency computed tomography scan showed an extensive intraparenchymal hemorrhage that caused significant mass effect and tonsilar herniation. During surgery, an increased intracranial pressure was recorded and extensive bilateral decompressive craniectomies were performed. A cherry-like intraparenchymal lesion was found in his right frontal lobe and resected. The patient died in the intensive care unit after approximately 48 hours. The resected lesion was identified as a central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor."
