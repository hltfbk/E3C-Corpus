  "text": "A 75-year-old male with multiple medical comorbidities, including a recent diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, presented to a large academic medical center for a right total hip arthroplasty revision. The patient's preoperative neurologic examination demonstrated brisk deep tendon reflexes, visible fasciculations of lower extremities, and motor weakness of upper and lower extremities. Serology demonstrated an elevated creatine kinase, and an electromyography study showed active denervation in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions. After a careful risk-benefit analysis was performed, involving a multidisciplinary team approach, the patient successfully underwent the surgical procedure with a spinal anesthetic and minimal sedation. Perioperative course was unremarkable, and there were no neurologic complications in the first 6 months after surgery."
