  "text": "We report the case of a 48-year-old female with rapidly progressive kidney failure, arthro-myalgia and weight loss. Auto-immune screening showed anti-dsDNA antibodies, complement consumption and triple ANCA positivity. A first kidney biopsy done at presentation highlighted class IV-G glomerulonephritis with elective extra-capillary involvement and mainly C1q glomerular deposition at immunofluorescence study. After three months of a regimen combining steroids and cyclophosphamide, a second biopsy was performed and showed class IV-G glomerulonephritis with mainly endocapillary proliferation."
