  "text": "We reported one case of a middle-aged woman with a huge borderline PT in the right breast, over 20 cm in size. The pathology of needle core biopsy of the lump was suggestive of PT of the borderline subgroup, and then she underwent mastectomy of the right breast. The patient had recovered well without any postoperative treatment until a local recurrence occurred 1 year after operation. The tumor was removed with lumpectomy, which was pathologically diagnosed as malignant PT. We followed up her by telephone and heard about her postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as her well recovery."
