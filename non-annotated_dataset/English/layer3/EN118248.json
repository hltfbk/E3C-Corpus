  "text": "A case of burned-out tumor of the testis in a 31-year-old man is reported. The tumor presented as a retroperitoneal mass with histological characteristic of a seminoma. The testes on clinical examination were normal, and a suspicious lesion in the scrotum was only identified after ultrasound. Incision of the abdominal mass was decided, followed by orchectomy. Histological examination of the testis revealed a suspicious lesion with characteristics of spontaneous regression of germ cell tumors."
