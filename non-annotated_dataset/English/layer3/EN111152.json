  "text": "A 75-year-old man with pancreaticoduodenectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer was diagnosed with a lung metastasis 48 months after surgery. Histological findings after thoracoscopic partial resection of the right lung by video-assisted thoracic surgery confirmed the presence of a lung metastasis originating from the pancreatic cancer. The patient refused chemotherapy. A new lung metastasis was detected 84 months following the second surgery (132 months after the pancreaticoduodenectomy). After thoracoscopic partial resection of the left lung by video-assisted thoracic surgery, the histological findings once again confirmed a metastasis that originated from the pancreatic cancer. The patient refused chemotherapy and remained alive and relapse-free after the 10-month follow-up."
