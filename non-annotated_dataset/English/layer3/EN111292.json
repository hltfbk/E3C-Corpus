  "text": "A 16-month old boy with a 7-day history of fever was admitted to our pediatric ward for pyrexia workup. After complete investigations, KD was confirmed by a pediatric rheumatologist. During his admission and serial follow-up tests, an isolated AST elevation was noted. Comprehensive tests were performed and using the polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method, macro-AST was confirmed. The patient has been followed up for 3 years, and so far, the benign nature of this condition has been confirmed."
