  "text": "We are hereby presenting a case of extra skeletal soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma with unusual translocation of chromosome t (4, 22) (q35, q12). Patient presented to us in advanced stage with pulmonary metastasis and lower limb neurological deficit. Relatively few variant translocations have been reported in primary Ewing's sarcomas (ES). To date, 13 variants of the EWS fusion gene have been described in literature. They are extremely rare, representing altogether < 1% of the cases' 23we are reporting a case of a variant simple translocation of chromosome t (4; 22) (q35;1 2). In our exhaustive literature search we could find only one case of complex translocation which was identified in a dysmorphic 15-year-old girl, t (4:11; 22)(q21; q24; q12) reported by Squire Jet al (1993)."
