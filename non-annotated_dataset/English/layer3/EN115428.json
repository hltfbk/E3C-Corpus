  "text": "A 59-year-old Caucasian female had undergone implantation of a gastric stimulator to cope with the symptoms of a partial gastroparesis. Eight years after the operation, the patient began to present repeatedly to different hospitals because of abdominal pain and nausea. Symptoms and imaging indicated ileus, which could always be treated conservatively. The underlying pathology could not ultimately be determined and the symptoms were eventually considered gastroparesis-related. After two years the patient was finally referred in circulatory shock due to peritonitis with underlying small bowel obstruction. Emergency laparotomy revealed small bowel strangulation by the gastric stimulator electrodes."
