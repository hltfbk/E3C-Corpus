  "text": "A 37-year-old man was admitted with an acute onset of abdominal pain. CT showed a 32 x 25 cm mass with some cystic lesions and areas of calcification. Twelve hours after admission the patient presented with an episode of upper GI bleeding, and a significant decrease of tumor size and hemoglobin level. An upper endoscopy showed a large bulge in the posterior aspect of the gastric wall, and a small ulcer with continuous bleeding coming from a central orifice. A subtotal gastrectomy was carried out. Pathological examination showed a giant gastric GIST measuring 32 x 25 x 21 cm and weighing 3.750 g. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated positive reactivity to C-kit protein, CD34, and alpha-smooth muscle actin; but negative reactivity to S-100 protein."
