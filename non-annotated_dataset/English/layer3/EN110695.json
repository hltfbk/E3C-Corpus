  "text": "This paper describes a 70-year-old man with an incidental orbital mass detected by an imaging test and who later developed associated symptoms. The mass was diagnosed as neuromuscular hamartoma. Superior rectus muscle recession and inferior rectus muscle resection were performed in the right eye for hypertropia secondary to postoperative inferior rectus muscle palsy. Hypertropia in the right eye and diplopia improved after surgery, and regular follow-up is underway."
