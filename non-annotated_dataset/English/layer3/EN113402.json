  "text": "An 11-year-old boy was referred to the maxillofacial unit of Sulaimany Teaching Hospital, Iraq, with midline facial destruction. The patient stated that about 6 months prior he had fallen down and suffered nasal trauma; 3 months after the trauma, an asymptomatic ulcer appeared and gradually increased in size. Two biopsies were performed with no conclusive results. In the third biopsy, histology showed atypical lymphoid tissue surrounded by intense necrosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The treatment of choice was chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. The patient had a satisfactory response but 2 months later during chemotherapy the patient unfortunately died from a pulmonary embolism."
