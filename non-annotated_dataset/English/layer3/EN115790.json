  "text": "We report the challenging case of a 56-year-old, caucasian man in whom pathological assessment of pelvic lymph nodes removed during radical retropubic prostatectomy for a high-grade prostatic neoplasm revealed Hodgkin lymphoma, which was subsequently classified as stage IV. There are very few published reports of this combination of pathologies. This situation required a cautious and expert approach to delivering the most appropriate treatment with the most appropriate timing for both diseases."
