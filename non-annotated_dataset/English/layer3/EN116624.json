  "text": "A 30-year-old Moroccan man consulted us for left back pain associated with urinary frequency and a few macroscopic episodes of hematuria for the past six months. A computed tomography urography revealed a left hydronephrosis and hydroureter secondary to focal wall thickening of the left lumbar ureter. Hence, we had diagnosed a ureteral tumor. However, a clinical examination showed irritative voiding symptoms and epididymal disorders associated with prostate infection suggesting a Koch's bacillus assessment of the patient's urine of which the results proved strongly positive. The treatment consisted of establishing a double-J ureteric stent to drain the left kidney, followed by antituberculous antibiotics."
