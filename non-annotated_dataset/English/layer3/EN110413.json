  "text": "A 47 years old lady presented with menorrhagia and lower abdominal pain with a tender swelling in left lower side of previous CS scar. She gave history of lower abdominal pain for the last 4 years with a swelling on left lower part of her cesarean scar. According to the patient she noticed increase in size and pain at least a week before and during menstruation to such an extent that she needed analgesia. She had 3 previous CS and last one was about 6 years ago. Ultrasound showed a mass of 4.1×2.8 cm in lower left side of anterior abdominal wall with minimal blood flow on doppler and a uterine fibroid of about 8 ×7 cm in posterior uterine wall. Computerized tomography (CT) scan was arranged for her which showed the same findings in longitudinal and transverse sections, the radiologist gave provisional diagnosis of desmoid, hematoma, lipoma or endometrioma of the rectus muscle or rectus sheath. The patient agreed for myomectomy along with excision of this swelling. During the dissection of anterior abdominal wall, lot of fibrosis was observed with a mass of dark brown colored very adherent to surrounding structures on left rectus sheath involving the rectus muscle as well, it was excised and sent for histopathological analysis, myomectomy was done and no endometriosis was found anywhere in the pelvis. The histopathologist reported it to be an endometrioma of rectus abdominis muscle involving the rectus sheath as well. The patient was discharged after routine post-operative care and she was relieved of her symptoms on follow-up."
