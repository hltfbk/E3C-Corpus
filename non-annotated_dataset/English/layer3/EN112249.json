  "text": "A 74-year-old Chinese woman presented with multiple subcutaneous masses, abdominal pain, and fever. An IgM kappa type of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) was noted by immunofixation performed on the patient's serum. Computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed subcutaneous masses on the left upper arm and at the waist and multiple low-density lesions in the spleen. Microscopically, sections of subcutaneous masses revealed sheets of large polygonal and spindle cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, round to ovoid eccentric nuclei, reticulate chromatin, and median nucleoli. Massive needle-shaped crystals were confined to the cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, these crystal-containing cells were positive for CD68/PGM1, CD163, IgM, and IgÎº. Meanwhile, the splenic tumour was diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), non-germinal-centre B (non-GCB) subtype (Hans algorithm). Immunohistochemistry for IgM was positive in the cytoplasm of some neoplastic cells. Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement was detected by PCR analysis of the subcutaneous mass and the splenic tumour."
