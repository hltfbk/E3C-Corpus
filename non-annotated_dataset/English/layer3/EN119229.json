  "text": "We report the case of a 47 year old man who developed sudden onset right leg pain during coitus. This was initially believed to be neurological due to nerve impingement but an MRI failed to identify a prolapse. On further review after 6 weeks, pulses were noted to be absent in the patient's right leg and an urgent vascular review with investigation identified a dissection of the aorta which was subsequently successfully treated."
