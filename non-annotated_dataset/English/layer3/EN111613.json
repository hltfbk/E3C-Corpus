  "text": "We present a case of 70-year-old woman presented with a 2-wk history of fever and abdominal pain. She had had rheumatoid arthritis for 5 years and was being treated with medication including methotrexate. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed multiple low density tumors in the liver and the histological analyses showed significant proliferation of lymphocytes in masses that were positive on immunohistochemical staining for CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD79a but negative for CD20 and CD56. Staining for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA was negative. And based on these findings, the liver tumors were diagnosed as Methotrexate-related lymphoproliferative disorders. A time-dependent disappearance of the liver tumors after stopping methotrexate supported the diagnoses."
