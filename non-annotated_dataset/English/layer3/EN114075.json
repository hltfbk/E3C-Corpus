  "text": "A 4-year-old boy presented with painless soft tissue swelling over knee with no history of recent trauma. Radiograph was normal and USG showed a well-defined hypoechoic cystic lesion. Patient was taken for surgery and the lesion was removed. Lesion came out to be a ganglion cyst originating from the semitendinosus tendon. Post-operative USG was done to confirm complete removal of the ganglion."
