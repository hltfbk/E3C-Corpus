  "text": "A 56-year-old man with underlying oral cancer received radiofrequency ablation for a metastatic liver tumor at segment II. Pleuritic chest pain developed on the day after radiofrequency catheter ablation. Diffuse ST elevation and echocardiography showed the new onset of small to moderate pericardial effusion without tamponade sign. Inflammatory markers were also elevated. Acute pericarditis due to heat penetration and stimulation was favored. His symptoms and signs resolved after treatment with anti-inflammatory medication."
