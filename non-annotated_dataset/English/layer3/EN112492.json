  "text": "We report a case of a 69-year-old African American woman using risperidone who presented with worsening visual acuity and was found to have bilateral cystoid macular edema. Upon decreasing the dosage of risperidone, the cystoid macular edema resolved and visual acuity markedly improved. Fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography were used to document the severity of cystoid macular edema and subsequent resolution after decreased dosage of risperidone."
