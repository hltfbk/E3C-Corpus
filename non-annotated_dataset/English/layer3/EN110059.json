  "text": "A 4-day-old full term male baby with a birthweight of 3100 g was admitted with history of bilious vomiting, inability to pass meconium, and abdominal distension since birth. On examination, he had a white forelock of hair and massively distended abdomen, pale irises, and absence of reaction to any sound. Radiographic investigations revealed dilated bowel loops but no air-fluid levels or pelvic gas. The barium enema was normal. The patient was given intravenous fluid resuscitation and nasogastric decompression and operated on the fifth day of life. An exploratory laparotomy was undertaken revealed distended proximal jejunal and ileal loops, the 30 cm of terminal ileum and the colon were contracted. Multiple sero-muscular biopsies were taken from colon and terminal ileum; appendectomy was also performed. A divided ileostomy was performed at the transition zone. Histological examination of gut biopsies showed aganglionosis in colon and terminal ileum, compatible with Hirschsprung disease. A diagnosis of Shah-Waardenburg syndrome was made. The enterostomies started to function on the second postoperative day, and he started to gain weight. However, the baby died because of sepsis at 4 weeks of age."
