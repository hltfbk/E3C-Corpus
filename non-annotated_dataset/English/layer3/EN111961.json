  "text": "This report describes two cases of Glomerulopathy with fibronectin deposits, involving a 47-year-old father and a 14-year-old son. The renal biopsies showed glomeruli with endocapillary hypercellularity and large amounts of mesangial and subendothelial eosinophilic deposits. Immunohistochemistry for fibronectin was markedly positive. Whole exome sequencing identified a novel FN1 mutation that leads to an amino-acid deletion in both patients (Ile1988del), a variant that required primary amino-acid sequence analysis for assessment of pathogenicity. Our primary sequence analyses revealed that Ile1988 is very highly conserved among relative sequences and is positioned in a C-terminal FN3 domain containing heparin- and fibulin-1-binding sites. This mutation was predicted as deleterious and molecular mechanics simulations support that it can change the tertiary structure and affect the complex folding and its molecular functionality."
