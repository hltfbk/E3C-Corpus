  "text": "A six year old male presented acute right-sided testicular pain. His history included transient infantile neutropenia, resolved hepatosplenomegaly, and longstanding livedo racemosa, leading to screening and confirmation of DADA2 caused by homozygous c.139G > C (p.G47R) mutation of ADA2. As his only clinical feature was that of mild livedo racemosa with normal laboratory parameters at diagnosis, he was being actively monitored prior to starting any treatment. At a routine clinic follow-up a 24 h history of testicular pain was noted on systems review. He was afebrile, and his only physical signs were that of moderate livedo racemosa, and tenderness of the right testicle. Laboratory parameters revealed C-reactive protein (CRP) 8 mg/L (reference range [RR] < 20 mg/L); erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 28 mm/hr. (RR < 10); and serum amyloid A (SAA)5 mg/L (RR < 10). Ultrasound-scan of the scrotum revealed significantly reduced perfusion of the right testes, without torsion. Surgical scrotal exploration confirmed testicular ischaemia without torsion. Histology demonstrated ischaemic seminiferous tubules with intervening haemorrhage and acute inflammatory cells, consistent with vasculitis of the testis as the cause. He was treated with high dose intravenous methyl-prednisolone followed by a weaning course of oral prednisolone, and subcutaneous adalimumab (anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha, anti-TNFα). Repeat ultrasound-scan 3 weeks later revealed good testicular perfusion, with a small area of focal infarction. At last follow-up (11 months post-event) he remained asymptomatic, on treatment with adalimumab."
