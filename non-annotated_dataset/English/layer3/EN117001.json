  "text": "We report the case of a 48-year-old heavy smoker who presented with productive cough and progressive dyspnea. The study revealed a renal mass and lung alterations compatible with primary tumor of the lung. The patient underwent a right complete nephrectomy. The anatomopathological exam showed clear cell renal carcinoma (pT1bN0Mx). After transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy, the clinical diagnosis was stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung. Initially, the patient received one cycle of chemotherapy (cisplatin/pemetrexed). Two weeks later, the immunohistochemistry tests revealed a secondary lesion with probable renal origin. Chemotherapy was stopped and the patient was started on sunitinib treatment. After two cycles the disease progressed. A second-line treatment with everolimus was proposed; however, the patient died 2 weeks later due to terminal respiratory insufficiency."
