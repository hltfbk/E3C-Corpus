  "text": "A 61-year-old woman presented with a fracture in her right femoral neck and a non-displaced fracture in her left femoral neck. After total hip arthroplasty and pinning, the patient returned with bilateral insufficiency fractures of the medial tibial plateau. The fractures were secondary to her iron medication, ferric carboxymaltose (FCM)."
