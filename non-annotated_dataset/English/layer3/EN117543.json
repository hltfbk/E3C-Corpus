  "text": "A 36-year-old Caucasian man was admitted with this rare fracture combination, and was managed with closed fracture reduction and fixation with a dynamic hip screw combined with an anti-rotational cannulated screw. We found four similar cases on reviewing the literature from 1989 to 2009, but these were reports of older patients after low energy injury."
