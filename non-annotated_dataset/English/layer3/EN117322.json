  "text": "A 64-year-old female Caucasian with major depression, alcohol dependence and benzodiazepine dependence was successfully treated for depression and, after lorazepam-assisted alcohol detoxification, was switched from lorazepam to diazepam to facilitate benzodiazepine discontinuation. Subsequent to the benzodiazepine switch, our patient unexpectedly developed an acute delirious state, which quickly remitted after re-administration of lorazepam. A newly diagnosed early form of mixed dementia, combining both vascular and Alzheimer-type lesions, was found as a likely contributing factor for the observed vulnerability to benzodiazepine-induced withdrawal symptoms."
