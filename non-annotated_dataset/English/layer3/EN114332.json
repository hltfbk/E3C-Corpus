  "text": "In this case report, we present a 61-year-old female with primary biliary cirrhosis and human epidermal growth factor-2 (HER-2)-positive breast cancer, who subsequently developed cutaneous metastases. We briefly describe the treatment challenges due to underlying end-stage liver disease, and an exceptional response to trastuzumab and nab-paclitaxel."
