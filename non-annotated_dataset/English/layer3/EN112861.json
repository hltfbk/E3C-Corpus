  "text": "A 63-year-old SinhaleseÂ man with diabetes mellitus and a poor glycemic control presented with fever, loose stools, and loss of appetite of 1 week's duration. An examination was unremarkable apart from a mild non-tender hepatomegaly. Investigations indicated a septic process with neutrophil leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and raised inflammatory markers with acute kidney injury. Sonography of his abdomen revealed a large liver abscess with two blood cultures positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae. He made a complete recovery following aspiration of the abscess and treatment with intravenously administered ceftriaxone."
