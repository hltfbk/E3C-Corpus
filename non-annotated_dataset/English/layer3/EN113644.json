  "text": "A 39-year-old man was referred to our Department for further investigation of intermittent abdominal pain, especially in the right upper quadrant, and abdominal distension. Abdominal CT imaging revealed three calcified lesions, one in the liver, a similar adjacent to an ileal loop and one close to the urinary bladder, while antibody control was positive for echinococcal infection. The lesions were excised and the patient was discharged on the seventh post-operative day in good general condition. Post-operative control after 6â€‰months did not show any signs of recurrence."
