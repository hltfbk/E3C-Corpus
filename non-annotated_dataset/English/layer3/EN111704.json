  "text": "Two patients underwent surgical resection for thymic LELC. In both, tumors were detected in the anterior mediastinum and a total thymectomy was performed. Each was diagnosed with thymic LELC and classified in accordance with the Masaoka staging system as modified stage II. In recent examinations, one patient was doing well after undergoing total resection, whereas early recurrence of distant lymph node metastasis was noted in the other at 5â€‰months after the total resection procedure and died thereafter from a different disease."
