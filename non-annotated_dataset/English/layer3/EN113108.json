  "text": "We present the case of a 52-year-old Korean woman complaining of dry mouth and nail dystrophy for 4 months as an initial symptom. A slit lamp examination revealed superficial keratoconjunctival erosion in both eyes. A laboratory test showed anemia, azotemia, and proteinuria. Urine protein electrophoresis showed increased gamma globulin excretion. Serum free light chain of kappa and lambda were increased. Histopathological studies of biopsy specimens of minor salivary glands and kidney revealed deposits of amyloid fibrils. A bone marrow aspiration biopsy showed hypercellular marrow with 5% plasma cells. She was diagnosed as having primary systemic amyloidosis then started on chemotherapy."
