  "text": "A 44-year-old Chinese female underwent a gastroscopy to assess abdominal distension that had persisted for 2 months. A protruding lesion in the gastric antrum was revealed but no malignant tissue was found in the biopsy specimen. The patient's symptom persisted and progressed to repeated vomiting. Endoscopy after 4 months revealed obstruction of the gastric outlet caused by the protruding lesion. A distal gastrectomy was performed. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen showed the malignant transformation of aberrant pancreas in the stomach. Chemotherapy consisting of folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin was administered for three cycles, and was changed to gemcitabine monotherapy because of adverse effects and increased serum tumor marker levels. The patient remained asymptomatic during a 12-month follow-up."
