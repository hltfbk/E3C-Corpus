  "text": "A 40-year-old Moroccan man was followed up for a bladder tumor which manifested with coagulant hematuria and a facial erythrosis with a hemoglobin level of 20.3g/L suggesting polycythemia vera. The patient also suffered from an erectile disorder. Considering the anesthesia difficulty due to polyglobulia, the patient was treated by bleeding. This treatment enabled the patient's sexual performance to be improved and adjustment of his hemoglobin to a level allowing anesthesia, and hence surgical resection of his bladder tumor."
