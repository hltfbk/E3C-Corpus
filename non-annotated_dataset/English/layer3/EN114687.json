  "text": "We encountered a case of miliary nodules with gradually worsening coughing and sputum production in a 44-year-old male who had renal dysfunction due to glomerulosclerosis with a decade-long history of steroid therapy. Although we started anti-tuberculosis treatment on clinical suspicion of miliary tuberculosis, cultures of sputum and bronchial lavage were both positive for M. xenopi. The patient was successfully treated with rifampin, ethambutol and clarithromycin, without fibrosis. It was unclear whether the miliary pattern was induced by hematogenous or endobronchial spread of the M. xenopi infection."
