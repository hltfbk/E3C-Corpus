  "text": "We report a case in which articulating cement spacers were maintained in situ for 7â€‰years. The patient had severe left knee pain with an ankylosing knee and severe tricompartmental arthritis due to tuberculous infection. We planned to perform one- or two-stage primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), depending on the presence of infection. Persistent osteomyelitis was found intraoperatively. The second-stage TKA was delayed on the patient's request. As the patient was satisfied with the improved knee function and pain relief after using articulating cement spacers. No symptom or sign that suggested recurrent infection or systemic toxicity was found during the 7-year follow-up. However, it seemed that the bone loss progressed insidiously. At the 7-year follow-up, a broken articulating cement spacer and medial femoral condylar fracture were found. The second-stage TKA was performed, and a considerable amount of bone loss surrounded by dense granulation tissue was observed intraoperatively. Excisional biopsy of the tissue revealed chronic foreign body reaction with infiltration of giant cells and macrophages."
