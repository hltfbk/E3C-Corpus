  "text": "We described the case of a 12-year-old boy who presented with monocular vision loss accompanied by unusual MRI features of an extensive meningeal infiltrating mass lesion. The patient underwent surgical resection (biopsy) via a frontotemporal craniotomy to establish a definitive diagnosis based on the histopathology, since neurosarcoidosis remains a very difficult diagnosis to establish from neuroradiogenic imagings. Based on the histopathology of the resected mass lesion, neurosarcoidosis was diagnosed. On follow-up after 3Â months of steroid therapy, the patient displayed a good response on the imaging studies. MRI revealed that the preexisting mass lesion had regressed extremely. We also conducted a small literature review on imaging studies, manifestations, appropriate treatments, etc., in particular neurosarcoidosis including children."
