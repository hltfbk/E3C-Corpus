  "text": "An 82-year-old man underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer (T3N0M0, stage IIA). Six months after gastrectomy, CT and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT showed the appearance of a splenic mass. We diagnosed solitary splenic metastasis from gastric cancer and performed laparoscopic-assisted splenectomy. His splenic tumor was diagnosed as a sarcoid reaction by histopathological examination."
