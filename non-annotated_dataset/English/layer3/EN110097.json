  "text": "A 45-year-old woman presented with a 2-day history of progressively worsening abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant and vomiting, fever and headache. Three months previously, she had undergone a right radical mastectomy with axillar dissection, and pathologic examination revealed an invasive lobular carcinoma, corresponding to T3N1M0, Estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and cerb B2 were positive. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy were stared. To the emergency room, on physical examination, body temperature was 38. 3 c, blood pressure 125/65 mmHg, and pulse rate 105 /min. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the right upper abdomen and rigidity of the abdominal wall with positive murphy's sign. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin level of 10. 5 g/dl, a white cell count of 15. 800/ul with 90 % neutrophils, Biochemical tests were within normal rang (SGPT, SGOT, ALP, gamma-GT, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, LDH, lipase). Ultrasound examination revealed a sludge and irregular thickness of the gallbladder. The diagnostic of acute cholecystitis was made. The patient underwent open laparotomy and cholecystectomy without complication. The nodule was perceptible and palpable on the gallbladder wall, without gross involvement of the liver or regional lymph nodes, examination of the abdominal cavity showed no signs of peritoneal metastases. On gross examination, the Gallbladder was thickened, with a 1. 5 cm palpable mass. Histopathological examination, however, revealed the metastasis. The gallbladder wall was infiltrated (muscular layer and adventitia) by lobular breast carcinoma, hormone receptors were positive. Additionally, the pathological evaluation showed features of chronic cholecystitis with fibrosis of the Gallbladder wall."
