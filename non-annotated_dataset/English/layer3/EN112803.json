  "text": "The temperature differences between the symptomatic areas and the normal areas were tested in three patients with nummular headache accompanied by changes in scalp temperature. Three patients' symptomatic areas were either colder or warmer than the normal areas. In every case, we took measurements from the painful site and from the opposite side of the head. The margin of error was 0.01 °C, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01)."
