  "text": "This case describes a 58-year-old woman admitted to our institution for a hepatic mass incidentally discovered during a routine examination. The patient, who was never on oral contraceptives, was asymptomatic upon admission. She underwent a thorough diagnostic evaluation and then a hepatic right trisegmentectomy. The histologic evaluation of the mass showed that it was a hepatocellular adenoma with areas of bone marrow metaplasia."
