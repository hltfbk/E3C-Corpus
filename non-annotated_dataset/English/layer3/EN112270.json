  "text": "We report the case of a 24-year-old Han Chinese female who initially presented with a perianal abscess that was subsequently diagnosed as nasal type ENKTL. Due to typical perianal pain, perianal abscess was diagnosed and surgical incision and drainage were performed. After recurrent, severe anal hemorrhages leading to hypovolemic shock and multiple surgeries, a diagnosis of ENKTL was made. The patient's condition gradually deteriorated, and she died shortly after initiation of chemotherapy."
