  "text": "In this case report, we present a case involving a 72-year-old male with a history of paraganglioma of the neck. He had been experiencing bilateral shoulder pain, neck pain and weakness in the upper extremities for more than six months. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine revealed a metastasis at C4 with severe vertebral body destruction. To avoid serious complications associated with surgical resection, CyberKnifeÂ® radiosurgery (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was performed on the parapharyngeal and cervical lesions. A secondary surgery, which involved a posterior laminectomy at C3-6 and posterior fusion at C1-T1, was performed two weeks after the radiosurgery. A histological examination of the surgical specimen demonstrated a malignant paraganglioma. The patient regained strength in all extremities in the postoperative field, and his pain was dramatically reduced. A magnetic resonance imaging study performed three months after the surgery showed a reduced tumor size and spinal cord decompression."
