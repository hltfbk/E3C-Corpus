  "text": "A 39-year-old Caucasian man presented with acute angle-closure glaucoma; he initially presented with intractable headaches after being treated with an escalating dose of topiramate. Clinical signs included elevated intraocular pressure that was initially refractory to treatment, shallow anterior chambers, and extensive bilateral choroidal effusions. After treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone, in conjunction with conventional glaucoma treatment, there was rapid reduction of intraocular pressure, gradual delayed resolution of the choroidal effusion and induced myopic shift; and eventually a good outcome without optic nerve damage."
