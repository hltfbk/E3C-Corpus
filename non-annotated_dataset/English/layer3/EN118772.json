  "text": "We present the case of a 24-year-old male who was diagnosed with a giant retroperitoneal liposarcoma. The patient received palliative treatment due to non-resectability on the basis of chemotherapy. We decided to perform surgery after no benefit was received with systemic treatment. Complete macroscopic resection of the tumor was performed, without multi-organ resection. The patient is currently alive and disease free at 14 months of evolution."
