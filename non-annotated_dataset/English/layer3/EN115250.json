  "text": "We report a case of a 51-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presented with sudden onset of malaise, syncope, gingival bleed and epistaxis. She was found to have severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count 6,000/Î¼l) and anemia (hemoglobin 7.2 g/dl). Her workup led to the diagnosis of metastatic ductal breast cancer with extensive bone metastasis. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrated myelophthisis which was initially thought to be consistent with her presentation of thrombocytopenia and anemia. Therefore, the patient was started on hormonal therapy for the treatment of her metastatic breast cancer. After 3 months of therapy, she did not improve and developed severe mucosal bleeding. Her clinical presentation was suspicious for ITP and immune-mediated anemia, and hence she was started on steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin. The patient had a dramatic response to therapy with normalization of her platelet count and hemoglobin within 2 weeks."
