  "text": "An 85 year-old Caucasian man, unable to eat independently and whose fluid intake was controlled, underwent continuous bladder irrigation with a 3-way catheter due to a severe episode of macrohematuria. During the third day of hospitalization, while still undergoing bladder irrigation, he suddenly experienced extreme shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, and cough with frothy sputum. His attending nurse immediately noted that there was no return of the fluid (5 liters) introduced through bladder irrigation. He was treated urgently with hemodialysis. At the beginning of the dialysis treatment, the patient had gained 7.4 kg since the previous measurement (24 hours prior) without any clear explanation. Although a significant weight loss (from 81 to 76 kg) due to the dialysis procedure, the patient died shortly after the final treatment. The autopsy revealed that the brain and the lungs were heavily edematous. Microscopic examination of bladder specimens revealed interstitial and mucosal swelling, and loss of the superficial cell layer. Intermediate and basal urothelial cells were preserved. Altogether the above mentioned findings were suggestive of a diffuse disruption of the urothelium. In conclusion the death of the man was attributed to an acute severe pulmonary edema due to massive fluid absorption."
