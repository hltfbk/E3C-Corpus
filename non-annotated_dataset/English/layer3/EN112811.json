  "text": "A 21-year-old male Caucasian, with main complaints of fatigue and palpitations, was referred to our Centre due to a cystic formation in his left ventricle. The workup consisted of transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, which revealed a huge hydatid cyst in an active stage of disease, occupying the basal and mid part of the interventricular septum. Due to the size of the lesion and lack of viable myocardium in the affected area, the patient was declared inoperable and medical therapy was initiated. Serial echocardiography revealed a significant reduction in the size of the lesion and degradation to transitional and inactive stage, after which successful surgical excision of the cyst was performed. In the course of the medical treatment, the patient experienced sustained ventricular tachycardia causing loss of consciousness, which did not reoccur after surgical excision."
