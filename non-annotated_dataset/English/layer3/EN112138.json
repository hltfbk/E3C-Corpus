  "text": "We present a case of bilateral neglected clubfoot in a 34-year-old female. Management involved the novel combination of the gradual distraction of prepared triple arthrodesis surfaces and the Ponseti regimen which was achieved using the three-dimensional corrective power of hexapod-type circular fixators. Both feet were corrected to achieve plantigrade painless feet."
