  "text": "We present a 36-year-old female with hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury refractory to treatment. Whole body Flourine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) showed increased metabolic uptake with ill-defined lesions in the liver, spleen, and pelvic lymph nodes. Biopsy of the ill-defined lesions in the liver showed necrotizing granulomatous lesions without angiitis. All the markers of tuberculosis were negative and angiotensin converting enzyme levels were elevated. Patient improved with 1â€‰mg/kg/day oral steroid therapy and is on regular follow-up with minimal dose of steroids."
