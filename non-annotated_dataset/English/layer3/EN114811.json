  "text": "A 2-year-old boy was receiving chronic haemodialysis via a right internal jugular cuffed, double-lumen, tunneled haemodialysis catheter, inserted 3 months previously. He was asymptomatic and was incidentally found to have had embolization of a fractured catheter tip into a segmental branch of the left pulmonary artery. The catheter was replaced and the embolized fragment successfully retrieved, non-surgically, using an image-guided endovascular approach with a loop snare device."
