  "text": "Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging we assessed a 24-year old woman affected by migraine without aura at two different times: during a spontaneous migraine attack and in interictal phase. Seed-to-voxel whole brain analysis was carried out using the posterior cingulate cortex as a seed, representing the default mode network (DMN). Our results showed decreased intrinsic connectivity within core regions of the DMN with an exception of a subsystem including the dorsal medial and superior frontal gyri, and the mid-temporal gyrus which is responsible for pain interpretation and control. In addition, increased connectivity between the DMN and pain and specific migraine-related areas, such as the pons and hypothalamus, developed during the spontaneous migraine attack."
