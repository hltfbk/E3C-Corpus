  "text": "This is a 72-year-old woman with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, atrial fibrillation (ACFA), ischemic stroke 3 years ago with left hemiparesis, cavum cancer 1 year ago treated with radiotherapy. She consulted the emergency room for pelvic pain that had been changing for 1 day. On examination we found an afebrile patient, with a PA at 16/08, a pulse at 100 bpm. On abdominal examination we found an abdominopelvic mass of 15*10 cm. A biology Hb = 7.1, GB = 9600, creatinine = 102, urea = 8. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast injection was reported for renal failure, which showed a pelvic mass of 15*10 cm probably necrotic.\nThe diagnosis of a complicated adnexal tumor was suspected, hence the decision to operate the patient urgently. It was operated medianly. On exploration, we found a mass of 13 cm at the expense of the necrotic small hail adhering to the peritoneum at the level of the pelvis. A 30 cm resection of the small bowel was performed with a small-bowel anastomosis at the mechanical forceps. The patient was transferred to the postoperative unit where she received adequate transfusion and resuscitation. The postoperative course was simple with a dietary recovery at day 5. The patient was discharged 15 days postoperatively. Histopathological examination found spindle-cell type undifferentiated (unclassified) sarcoma with healthy resection margins."
