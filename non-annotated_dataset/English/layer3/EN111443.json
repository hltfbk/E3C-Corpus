  "text": "A 29-year-old previously healthy woman, gravida 1 para 0, presented for a scheduled second trimester induced abortion via dilation and evacuation at 22-weeks gestation. The case was complicated by a suspected AFE with associated profound coagulopathy. Viscoelastic point-of-care coagulation analysis was used to successfully and swiftly guide management of her coagulopathy."
