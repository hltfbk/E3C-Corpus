  "text": "A 55 year old male presented with right sudden right lower limb pain and numbness 1 week following a successful left retrograde superficial femoral artery (SFA) angioplasty. Computed tomography (CT) angiogram revealed that the Celt ACD® VCD had embolised in the right tibioperoneal trunk. An endovascular approach was initially attempted to retrieve the VCD; however, this was unsuccessful due to the small diameter of the target artery. Due to the failure of the endovascular approach, surgical exploration of the right tibioperoneal trunk was undertaken, which led to the successful retrieval of the embolised VCD."
