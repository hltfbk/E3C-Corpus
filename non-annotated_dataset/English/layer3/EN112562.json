  "text": "A 38-year-old Japanese woman suffered from acute cholangitis; a blood culture showed that Gram-negative rod was positive. The treatment was successful with intravenously administered meropenem, and it was switched to orally administered levofloxacin according to microbiological susceptibility. The organism was identified as Pantoea dispersa by both genetic investigation by 16S ribosomal RNA and additional biochemical tests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of Pantoea dispersa bacteremia caused by acute cholangitis."
