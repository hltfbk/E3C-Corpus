  "text": "A 62-year-old female gradually started experiencing dyspnea during exercise. Coronary computed tomography revealed that the left coronary artery arose from the main pulmonary artery. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with adult-type, anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. She underwent a surgery, in which a 6-mm vascular prosthesis was passed through the main pulmonary artery to anastomose the left coronary artery and ascending aorta."
