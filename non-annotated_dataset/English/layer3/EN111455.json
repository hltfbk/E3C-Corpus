  "text": "A 62-year-old female had a past medical history of FIGO stage IIB cervical cancer (squamous cell carcinoma pT2bN0M0). In 1987, she underwent radical hysterectomy with bilateral iliac lymph node dissection, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy-70 Gy external beam pelvic irradiation followed by 30.5 Gy of brachytherapy. Thirty-two years later, she presented with signs of rectal bleeding. Regarding past medical history, radiologic, endoscopic, and pathologic data, the patient was initially diagnosed with a malignant nonepithelial lower rectal tumor of the unknown origin and staged as mrT3a mrN0 cM0. Total mesorectal excision with complete mesocolic excision and central vascular ligation (CME/CVL) carried by an open approach was carried out. In an attempt to identify the tissue of origin, an immunohistochemistry assay had been performed. Tumor cells showed a high rate of mitotic activity with a 45% rate of Ki-67 expression, positive reaction for desmin, and SMA in all samples. Negative reaction for CD117 and S100 was observed. As a conclusion, the immunophenotype was identified as a grade 3 leiomyosarcoma (ISD-code 8890/3)."
