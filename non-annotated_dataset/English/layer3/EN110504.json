  "text": "A 14 year old male was diagnosed with asthma but didn't improve with appropriate inhalation therapy. He was obese and also a cigarette smoker, one year before he was admitted for “pneumonia”. Bronchoscopy provided evidence of atelectasis caused by a mucus plug in the lower left bronchus which was removed. On admission he complained of persistent cough not responding to inhalation therapy with steroids and long acting beta agonist. His skin prick tests were positive for grass; spirometry revealed FEV 1 57% without broncho-reversibility. He was started on inhalation therapy with fluticasone propionate 200mcg/d. Cigarette smoking withdrawal and correction of obesity were proposed. At follow up evaluation 3 months later, he showed no improvement of lung function at spirometry. Thus, inhalation therapy was step-up with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol, at the dose of 25/50mcg (100/200mcg/d) and subsequently at the dose of 25/125mcg (100/500mcg/d), without clinical and functional improvement. Meanwhile, he had continued to smoke and his weight remained stable. Imaging study with chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan showed a new atelectasis engaging the lower-left lung. Therefore, rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia was performed and off-white non-purulent secretions, almost completely occluding the bronchial lumen, were visualized and removed from lower-left bronchus. The removed material was analyzed and found to be compatible with a piece of food. Rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia was repeated after 3 months: a residual foreign body was still present and was completely removed. Afterwards, chest CT and spirometry were repeated after 2 months for final evaluation and both turned out to be completely normal."
