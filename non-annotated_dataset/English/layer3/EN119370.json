  "text": "We describe a 38-year-old woman who presented with a palpable breast lump, which measured 5 x 4 cm. A local excision of the lump was performed and a diagnosis of cavernous lymphangioma was made. The patient is alive and well, after five years of follow-up, with no complaints or recurrence."
