  "text": "A 51-year-old lady presented with a 4-day history of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, fever, rigors, and lethargy. Imaging revealed an abscess which was drained. Cultures of the blood and abscess aspirate grew Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella pleuritidis respectively. She achieved full recovery following treatment. A MEDLINE search was undertaken using free-text and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), keywords \"Fusobacterium\" and \"Liver abscess\". Non-English language reports and cases without confirmed growth of Fusobacterium species were excluded. Additional cases were identified by surveying the references of each report and by using the same keywords in a web-based search. Forty-eight cases were identified, 41 in men. The median age was 42.5, with an interquartile range of 33. F. nucleatum and F. necrophorum were in involved in 22 cases each, and 4 cases were not further speciated. Among cases of F. nucleatum liver abscess, nine were attributed to periodontal disease, four to lower gastrointestinal tract disease, one to Lemierre's Syndrome, and eight were considered cryptogenic. All patients treated made a full recovery. Antimicrobial treatment duration ranged from 2 weeks to 6 months with a median of 6 weeks."
