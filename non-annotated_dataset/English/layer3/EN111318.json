  "text": "In 2017, a 53-year old man was referred to Tehran Heart Center (THC) with complaint of typical chest pain (TCP). In 2003 he had TCP and underwent coronary angiogram (CAG), due to positive non-invasive tests. Muscle-bridge in LAD was diagnosed. In 2007, he was symptomatic and another CAG was done, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting was performed. In 2008 he became symptomatic and his interventionist, decided to perform another CAG. At that time, he had CABG. He was asymptomatic until 2015, he referred to us with the same TCP and we decided to perform CAG for the fourth time. After two years, again another PCI was done due to in-stent restenosis."
