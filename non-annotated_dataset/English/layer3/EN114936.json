  "text": "We herein described two patients with brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer who achieved the total regression of metastasis with the administration of gefitinib. A 70-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with a severe cough. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a metastatic lesion in the left temporal lobe. The tumor was positive for an epidermal growth factor receptor L858R mutation in exon 21 using the peptide nucleic acid-locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp method. She was treated with 250 mg gefitinib per day, and, 1 month later, the primary lesion and brain metastasis had totally resolved. A 58-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with nausea and headache. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a metastatic lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere and meningeal dissemination. The tumor was positive for the epidermal growth factor receptor L858R mutation in exon 21. She was treated with 250 mg gefitinib per day, and, 3 weeks later, the primary lesion, brain metastasis, and meningeal dissemination had completely resolved."
