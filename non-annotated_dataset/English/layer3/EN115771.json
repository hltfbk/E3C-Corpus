  "text": "A 35-year-old Chinese woman presented to our hospital with difficulty breathing. Computerized tomography showed a tumor in the frontal area of her neck, which was causing extreme narrowing of her trachea. She was immediately scheduled for emergency surgery to remove the tumor. Fiberscopic intubation was carefully performed with dexmedetomidine sedation and remifentanil analgesia. Spontaneous respiration was successfully maintained."
