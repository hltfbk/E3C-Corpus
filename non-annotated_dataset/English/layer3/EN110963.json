  "text": "A 73-year-old man with a previous diagnosis of COPD stage 4 was admitted to our medical intensive care unit with chief complaints of cough, sputum, and dyspnea of several days' duration. For 10 mo, he had been on oxygen at home by day and had used an oronasal mask-based NIV at night. At intensive care unit admission, he breathed using respiratory accessory muscles. Hypercapnia and signs of infection were detected, and infiltration was observed in the right lower lung field by chest radiography. Thus, we diagnosed AECOPD by community-acquired pneumonia. After admission, respiratory distress steadily deteriorated and invasive mechanical ventilation became necessary. However, the patient refused this option, and thus, we selected helmet-based NIV as a salvage treatment. After 3 d of helmet-based NIV, his consciousness level and hypercapnia recovered to his pre-hospitalization level."
