  "text": "A 5-year-old boy presented with round-shaped fibrotic subretinal lesions in both eyes with surrounding subretinal fluid and progressive visual deterioration in the right eye. Fine foci of increased autofluorescence were observed along the arcades in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography revealed the presence of CNV in his right eye, and treatment with ranibizumab was initiated, with significant improvement in vision. Subsequent electroretinogram examination and genetic studies of the patient and his two younger siblings confirmed the diagnosis of ESCS."
