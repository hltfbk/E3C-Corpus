  "text": "An 18-year-old Chinese man presented to the cardiac intensive care unit with chest pain radiating to the left shoulder for 1 h after choledocholithiasis by ERCP and the following treatment. ECG showed a sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation in the II, III, and aVF leads compared with the baseline. Laboratory data revealed cTnI levels of 67.55 ng/mL and 80 ng/mL at the peak (relative index below 0.034 ng/mL) and creatine kinase-MB levels of 56 U/L and 543 U/L at the peak (relative index below 24 U/L). AMI was suspected, and coronary angiography was performed the second day. The results revealed a smooth angiographic appearance of all arteries. The patient had been diagnosed with gallstones and cholecystitis for four years but had not accepted treatment. He had abdominal pain and bloating a week previously and underwent ERCP and subsequent treatments on the second day of admission; 1.4 cm Ã— 1.6 cm of stones were removed from his common bile duct during surgery. The results of his laboratory tests at admission revealed abnormal alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, glutamyl transpeptidase, total bile acid, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin levels. His temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and body mass index were normal. His echocardiographic examination revealed no obvious abnormalities in the structure and movement of the ventricular wall and an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 57% after the heart attack. His cholesterol and triglycerides were within normal ranges, and his low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 2.23 mmol/L (normal range 2.03-3.34 mmol). Further testing after AMI revealed nothing remarkable in his erythrocyte sedimentation rate, thyroid function, and tumour markers."
