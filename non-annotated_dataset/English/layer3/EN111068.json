  "text": "The patient was a 76 year old male who was found incidentally to have a fusiform infrarenal AAA, the size of which was 55 mm in maximal transverse diameter. Despite the occlusions of left EIA, CFA and proximal parts of SFA and PFA, he did not have ischemic symptoms in his left leg due to the development of abundant collateral networks from left internal iliac artery. The patient had a past history of endarterectomy of left CFA. Since a repeated endarterectomy or interposition grafting of the CFA were deemed extremely difficult, without any patent runoff vessel, EVAR was performed using the occluded vessel simply as a conduit for the delivery of the endograft, without revascularizing the vessel. An angioplasty balloon was delivered from right CFA to the occluded left CFA through a subintimal space. A percutaneous puncture of the expanded balloon was done at the occluded left CFA under fluoroscopy, inserting the guidewire into the punctured balloon, finally establishing the through and through wire. EVAR was successfully performed using AFX unibody stentgraft without any complication."
