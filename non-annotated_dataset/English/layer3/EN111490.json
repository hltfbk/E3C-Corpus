  "text": "A 74-year-old Japanese woman with pSS who had been diagnosed as having IgA kappa-type MGUS developed progressive renal dysfunction. Renal biopsy revealed tubulointerstitial nephritis with abundant plasma cell-rich mononuclear cell infiltrates without atypia. Immunohistochemical staining for immunoglobulins and light chains showed that most infiltrates were positive for IgA and kappa. Most of the infiltrative cells were positive for CD38 and CD138, and cells positive for CD 19 and CD 45 were also widely evident. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies revealed no apparent immunological deposits in the glomeruli and tubules. Bone marrow and whole-body radiological examinations revealed no findings suggestive of multiple myeloma or lymphoma. Renal function improved rapidly with prednisolone 40 mg daily and has been maintained at the same level on low-dose prednisolone and azathioprine for 18 months."
