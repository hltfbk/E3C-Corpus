  "text": "A 31-year-old Japanese man who had no relevant past history other than sinusitis was admitted to our institution complaining of low-grade fever and mild headache. He was alert and neurologically intact. No respiratory symptoms were observed. Laboratory examination revealed mild elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and serum CD4/CD8 ratio. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level was in the normal range. His cerebrospinal fluid showed mild pleocytosis and increased protein level. A chest X-ray revealed bihilar lymphadenopathy with normal lung parenchyma. Computed tomography of his head showed remarkable hydrocephalus with dilatation of all ventricles, particularly the fourth. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated leptomeningeal millet seed-like enhancement and multiple small enhancing lesions along the Virchow-Robin spaces. These findings strongly suggested a chronic inflammatory disease such as neurosarcoidosis. To treat the hydrocephalus, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted. The postoperative course was satisfactory. After surgery, nasal and skin biopsies were performed and pathological analysis revealed non-caseating granulomas consistent with sarcoidosis. The findings of gallium scintigraphy also supported the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. We obtained the definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis 3 weeks after admission from the pathological findings by the nasal and skin biopsies, and corticosteroid therapy was started after that."
