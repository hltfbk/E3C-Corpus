  "text": "A 49-year-old woman presented with menstrual disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a huge uterine mass. The patient underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy and part of the uterine tissue looked like fish. Specimens were sent to frozen pathological examination for four times, but none of the results showed malignancy certainly. Considering all abnormalities, we removed the uterine through vagina completely rather than morcellation and did pelvic lymph node biopsy. Postoperative pathological examination revealed uterine leiomyosarcoma and one pelvic lymph node had metastasized."
