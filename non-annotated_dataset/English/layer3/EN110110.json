  "text": "A 26-year old female, was treated in rheumatology department for AOSD diagnosed in 2007. Initially, she was receiving 15 mg/ week of methotrexate 10 mg of prednisolone to control joint involvement. Our patient continued to have peripheral arthralgia with morning stiffness and a synovitis of the wrists, elbows and small joints of the hands. In March 2010, a treatment with Anakinra 100mg/day was introduced. This treatment has allowed the amendment of systemic signs including fever, but it did not improve joint symptoms. Anakinra was substituted by a TNF alpha blocker: adalimumab 40mg/2weeks in September 2010 and methotrexate was increased to 20mg/week. In November 2010, ten days after the last injection of adalimumab, she was hospitalized because of a persistant fever, joint pain and odynophagia. On examination, her temperature was 39.8°C, blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg and pulse rate 116/min. She was pale and asthenic. There was diffuse joint tenderness but not synovitis. She had a white blood cell count of 6700/mm ³, microcytic anemia with hemoglobin rate of 7.7g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 120 mm/hour and C-reactive protein of 225mg/dl. Liver and kidney blood tests were normal. During hospitalization, the general condition rapidly deteriorated, fiver persisted ranging from 38 to 41° C and blood investigations showed exacerbation of anemia (Hb=3.3g/dl), thrombocytopenia (100 000/mm ³), elevated alanine aminotransferase (767 U/L; normal 0-40), aspartate aminotransferase (930 U/L; normal 10?35), elevated LDH (1183 U/L), a very high ferritin level (40955mg/l), hyponatremia (125mmol/l), hypocalcimea (1.52mmol/l) and high triglyceride level. Although there was no histological confirmation, diagnosis of secondary MAS was established, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered at 1g/day for 3 days relayed by oral route 2mg/kg/day for a period of one month then the degression of corticoid was started. Her fever subsided gradually, together with improvement and normalization of laboratory investigations results. During the disease course, extensive studies could not identify any viral infection or other known underlying etiology for the reactive MAS. At this period, our patient was receiving corticosteroid 20mg /day, methotrexate 20 mg/week and adalimumab 40mg/2 week. Adalimumab was incriminated in this complication. After a month of the MAS, it was decided to give tocilizumab. The treatment has allowed the maintaining of apyrexia and the regression of joints pain. There was improvement in all the biochemical parameters."
