  "text": "A 17-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for dizziness and hypodynamia. The symptoms persisted for nearly 1 year. The laboratory tests revealed iron-deficiency anemia with abnormally low hemoglobin (Hb), and a strong positive fecal occult blood test. A total of four hemangiomas were detected: one in the stomach, one in the descending colon, and two in the small intestines with a high risk of hemorrhage. Under gastroendoscopy, enteroscopy, and video capsule endoscopy (VCE) throughout the GI tract, the patient underwent surgical treatment. Endoscopic mucosal resection was initially performed in the stomach and colon, and the lesions in the small intestine were resected with laparoscopy auxiliaried by single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE), during which SBE assisted in identifying the lesions. The patient well-tolerated the procedures, and had a favorable prognosis."
