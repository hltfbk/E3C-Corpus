  "text": "We present a previously healthy, 44-year-old HIV-infected man with DLBCL of the oral cavity, treated with immunochemotherapy and cART. During HIV-directed treatment, despite the successful virologic response, a satisfactory immunological response was not achieved. However, the patient had a 2-year complete remission after first-line treatment of DLBCL."
