  "text": "We describe a female term newborn with cloverleaf-shaped skull, facial hypoplasia, low ears, exophthalmos and wide, broad and deviated thumbs and hallux. The patient was diagnosed by ultrasound at 29 WGA and referred to a tertiary care hospital for her follow-up. Molecular test revealed a heterozygous pathogenic variant in intron 8 of the FGFR2 gene (FGFR2: c.940-1G>C). It was a de-novo mutation. At 17 days of life, craniosynostosis correction and a Lefort-III frontomaxillary advancement were performed."
