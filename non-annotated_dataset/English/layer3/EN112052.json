  "text": "A 29-year-old female who had worked at a bathtub factory presented with progressive exertional dyspnea for the past 2 years. Computed tomography revealed centrilobular, diffusely spreading ground-glass opacities sparing subpleural parenchyma with some cystic lesions and air-trapping in both lungs, suggesting a peculiar pattern of interstitial lung disease with airway involvement. There was not any evidence of right heart failure or pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram, as well as radiography. Microscopic examination of the lung by thoracoscopic resection showed atypical proliferation of capillary channels within alveolar walls and interlobar septa, without invasion of large vessels."
