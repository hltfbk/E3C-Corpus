  "text": "We describe here a case of a 49-year-old woman with a history of prior myocardial infarction who continued to be asymptomatic after a 10-year follow-up, in the absence of a high-risk profile for adverse outcomes. She was studied with multi-slice coronary computed tomography and whole-body angiography, which showed normal coronary and extra-coronary arteries."
