  "text": "We report a case of EC in a 70-year-old man who recently underwent transrectal ultrasound needle-guided prostate biopsy, after which he underwent pylorogastrectomy. He did not have any history of diabetes mellitus or any immunosuppressive disease. The patient developed severe sepsis, requiring intravenous antibiotics and urinary catheterization. Despite therapy, the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, he was admitted to the intensive care unit, antibiotic coverage was broadened, and danaparoid sodium and sivelestat sodium hydrate was administered. After 20 days, the patient's condition improved, and on the 28th day, the patient was discharged to home in a good condition without any sequelae."
