  "text": "we report here two patients, born to consanguineous Sri Lankan parents, present with bilateral postaxial oligodactyly limited to upper limbs. While the proband has no noticeable facial dysmorphism, renal impairments or cognitive impairments, his affected sister displays a few mild facial dysmorphic features. Whole exome sequencing of the proband showed a novel deleterious homozygous mutation (c.1348A > G) in the LRP4 gene, resulting in an Ile450-to-Val (I450V) substitution."
