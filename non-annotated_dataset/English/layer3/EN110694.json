  "text": "A 49-year-old woman was referred to our department with a cervical tumor, which was histologically suspected to be undifferentiated carcinoma. She underwent hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. The resected specimen contained high numbers of spindle cells and was immunohistochemically confirmed to be FDCS. The tumor was completely resected and recurrence was not detected at a 16-month follow-up."
