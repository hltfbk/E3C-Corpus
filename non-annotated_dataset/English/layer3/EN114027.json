  "text": "This is a case report of a 75-year-old man recently bedridden from a large hemispheric stroke with sudden onset of hoarseness, cough and dysphagia. A chest X-ray was obtained which showed a radiopaque coin-shaped foreign body, presumably a coin in his aerodigestive tract. He was promptly taken to the endoscopy suite for upper endoscopy. During endoscopy, it was determined that the foreign body was a radiopaque medication that he had been given. It was easily and safely able to be crushed and lavaged down into his stomach and later determined to be lanthanum carbonate, a commonly used phosphate binder. Following endoscopy, the patient's cough, hoarseness and dysphagia resolved with no long-term complications."
