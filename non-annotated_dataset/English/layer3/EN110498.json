  "text": "History of a previously healthy 53 years old male patient with a history of 3 episodes of painless gross hematuria, and one micturition syncope. A contrasted-enhanced CT scan (CECT) was performed and there was a contrast enhanced bladder mass with full wall invasion. No lymph nodes or peripheral lesions were detected. In October 2016, during the TURBT procedure he became severely hypertensive but controled under antihypertensive drugs. Histological examination of the TURBT specimen showed presence of a BPG. At 1-month postoperatively, plasma metanephrines (PM), and urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), were still high and the CECT scan plus cistoscopy suggested residual tumor. The patient underwent radical cistoprostatectomy in December 2016. Histological examination showed a BPG. The 24h urine showed a dramatic drop in VMA level after the surgery until now. After 4 years of follow-up with cistoscopy, CECT and VMA levels, the patient remains disease free."
