  "text": "We report a case of an eight-year-old girl who presented with progressive deformity of the right little finger. Radiographic evaluation revealed volar and radial curvature of the distal phalanx of the right fifth digit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) further revealed the deformity along with widening of the physeal plate, lack of soft tissue enhancement and normal insertion of the flexor digitorum profundus tendon. The patient was followed conservatively for two years and is now being considered for corrective osteotomy."
