  "text": "We describe the case of a 27-year old female from an English (Caucasian) kindred. She had been initially referred for hypertriglyceridemia, but demonstrated other features suggestive of AS, including blindness, obesity, type 2 diabetes, renal dysfunction, and hypertension. DNA analysis revealed that she is a compound heterozygote with two novel mutations in the ALMS1 gene - H3882Y and V424I. Examination of her family revealed that her phenotypically unaffected mother and younger sister also had heterozygous mutations in the ALMS1 gene. In addition to presenting these novel molecular findings for AS, we review the clinical and genetic features of AS in the context of our case."
