  "text": "A 33-year-old man with a history of infracentimetric carcinoma of the lip developed back pain associated with progressive neurological disorders leading to paraplegia. This atypical presentation led to initial misdiagnosis, but radiological and cytological explorations finally confirmed the diagnosis of leptomeningeal and intramedullar secondary spinal cord lesions from his previously treated head and neck SCC. Systemic targeted therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor and intrathecal chemotherapy led to prolonged disease stabilization."
