  "text": "A 51-year-old female complaining of intermittent diarrhea for 2 years was admitted to our hospital. Enhancement of total abdominal computed tomography scan, echocardiography, and magnetic resonance imaging indicated a mass in the left ventricle. The indexes of myocardial enzymes were normal. Histologically, round cells with well-differentiated neuroendocrine morphology were arranged in typical pseudo-glandular, trabecular, ribbon-like, and solid nest patterns. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56. However, they were negative for caudal type homeobox 2, S100, paired box gene 8, thyroid transcription factor 1, and CD20, which ruled out the origin of gastrointestinal, pancreatic, lung, and Merkel cell carcinomas. The symptoms of diarrhea disappeared after the operation. The patient was asymptomatic at the 9-month follow-up."
