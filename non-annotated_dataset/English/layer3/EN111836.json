  "text": "We report a 10-month-old malunited proximal tibia fracture with osteoarthritis of the knee joint who had underwent native splinting. The patient presented with complaints of pain over the left knee joint and inability to weight bear over his left leg for the past ten 10months. Radiographs showed malunited proximal tibia fracture. Since there were signs of osteoarthritis of the affected knee joint, it was decided to treat primarily by total knee arthroplasty. Postoperatively, the patient could walk freely without a stick and had no pain. The knee was stable and had a full range of movement."
