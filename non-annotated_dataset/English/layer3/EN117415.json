  "text": "A 72-year old Caucasian man with an osteoporotic compression fracture of the first lumbar vertebra after kyphoplasty developed sensory incomplete paraplegia below the first lumbar vertebra. This was caused by myelon compression following pyogenic spondylitis with a psoas abscess. Computed tomography guided aspiration of the abscess cavity yielded group C Streptococcus. The psoas abscess was percutaneously drained and laminectomy and posterior instrumentation with an internal fixator from the eleventh thoracic vertebra to the fourth lumbar vertebra was performed. In a second operation, corpectomy of the first lumbar vertebra with cement removal and fusion from the twelfth thoracic vertebra to the second lumbar vertebra with a titanium cage was performed. Six weeks postoperatively, the patient was pain free with no neurologic deficits or signs of infection."
