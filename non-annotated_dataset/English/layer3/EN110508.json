  "text": "It was a 3-year-old boy, the first child of a non-inbred couple, born of a natural pregnancy that was carried to term (39 weeks and 4 days). The neonatal period was uneventful and his vaccination is up to date. He was apparently well until the age of 6 months when he was admitted to the emergency room with fever secondary to recurrent acute otitis media. In addition, he suffered from perineal abscess, recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infection. At the age of one year, there were two episodes of pneumonia requiring hospitalization and intravenous antibiotic therapy. Two years later, he had pain and swelling in his joints at the wrists and knees with an inflammatory appearance. On examination, he weighed 11kg and measured 81cm. He is in perfect general condition. There was pain and swelling of the wrists and knees. The tonsils were very small and there were no palpable ganglions. The cardio-pulmonary, abdominal and neurological examination was unremarkable. The biological work-up had shown a haemoglobin level of 11.7g/dl, white blood cells at 5390/mm 3 with a formula showing deep and persistent neutropenia at 500mm 3. The sedimentation rate (SV) was 12mm at the first hour as the C-reactive protein was 8mg/l. Renal and hepatic function was normal. Antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor were negative. X-rays of hands/wrists and knees were normal. In view of the recurrent infections, a screening for immune deficiency was performed. The serum immunoglobulin assay showed an IgG level of 0.6g/l (age standard is 2-6g/l). IgM and IgA were indistinguishable. Spinal cord puncture revealed a rich marrow with a 10% blast rate and the absence of mature neutrophils in the marrow with a myeloid maturation blockage. No morphological abnormalities. Marrow immuno-phenotyping showed an absence of precursor B (less than 1% CD19, CD20, CD22, CD24 lymphocytes). A lymphocytosis B, absence of IgG and normal cellular immunity, age and sex support the diagnosis of Bruton's disease. Whether it is most likely remains to be confirmed by molecular biology (BTK mutation). Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin every four weeks has been started. Molecular biology being impossible to perform in Guinea, after parental consent, a DNA sample was taken and sent to Holland to search for a mutation of the BTK gene located in Xq21.3-q22. After several months, we had genetic confirmation of Bruton's disease (stop mutation, C37C) in exon 2 of the BTK gene. The patient responded well to intravenous Ig, no more infectious problems, no more joint swelling."
