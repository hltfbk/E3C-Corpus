  "text": "A 73-year-old man underwent right lower lobectomy with lymph node dissection (ND2a-2) for primary lung cancer (cT1cN2M0 Stage IIIA) with combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema. He developed a bronchopleural fistula on postoperative day 20, and we performed emergency fenestration without rib resection using a Lap-protector. The patient reported minimal pain postoperatively. As the rapid deterioration of the general condition due to the recurrence of the tumor was observed at the time of his 1-year postoperative follow-up, closing of the thoracic cavity was abandoned. However, using this fenestration, the control of infection in the thoracic cavity could be sufficiently performed without complications such as pain and pneumonia, and his routine activities were unaffected postoperatively."
