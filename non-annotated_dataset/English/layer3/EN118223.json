  "text": "A 25-year-old Asian woman presented with right hypochondrial pain and episodic biliary obstruction. Contrast enhanced computed tomography revealed a cystic mass in segment 4B and protruding into and along the left hepatic duct. Laparotomy confirmed the contrast enhanced computed tomography findings and histology revealed an intrahepatic mucinous biliary cystadenoma."
