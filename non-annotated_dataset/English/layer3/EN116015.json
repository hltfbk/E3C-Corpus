  "text": "A 32-year-old woman suffered from an isolated depressive disorder for 4 months before undergoing psychiatric evaluation. During the following 5 months, she manifested hypersexuality, dysarthria, imbalance, dyskinesias and decreased word output. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multifocal hyperintense T2/FLAIR lesions, a few contrast-enhanced, involving the corona radiata, the periventricular white matter, the deep gray nuclei, the optic nerves and the brainstem. MRI spectroscopy disclosed confluent bilateral demyelination and focal optic nerve involvement suggesting widespread encephalitis. Visual evoked potential studies indicated a demyelinating disorder. Serological screening and total body positron-emission tomography yielded negative findings for malignancies. Cerebrospinal fluid examination disclosed IgG oligoclonal bands and anti-NMDAR antibodies. Corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin provided only slight improvement, whereas switching to cyclophosphamide markedly improved her neurological status."
