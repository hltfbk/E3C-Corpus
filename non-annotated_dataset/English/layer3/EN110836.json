  "text": "Our 14-year-old female patient admitted with progressive shortness of breath, dizziness, and fatigue even after minimal physical activity was clinically suspected for PAH, based on her previous history. Her chest computed tomography artery reported the presence of PVOD triad features - subpleural thickened septal lines, ground-glass nodules/opacities and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Because of her weak physical stature, a lung biopsy was not performed; however, the genetic testing identified a novel heterozygous EIF2AK4 mutation at c.4833_4836dup (p.Q1613Kfs*10) - the dominant susceptible factor driving PVOD. Combination of genetic testing and computed tomography artery facilitated us to distinguish PVOD from PAH. Her disease symptoms advanced aggressively so that she died even before the lung transplantation, which was less than 6â€‰months from the onset of disease symptoms."
