  "text": "A 65-year-old Japanese man presented with nephrotic syndrome. He had no remarkable family history, but had a medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. On admission, hypertension, spironolactone-resistant hypokalemia (2.43 mEq/l), hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, and metabolic alkalosis, which suggested Liddle's syndrome, were observed. Treatment with triamterene together with a steroid for nephrotic syndrome resulted in rapid and remarkable effective on improvements of hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema of the lower extremities. Renal biopsy revealed membranous nephropathy (MN) as the cause of nephrotic syndrome, and advanced gastric cancer was identified on screening examination for cancers that could be associated with the development of MN. After total gastrectomy, triamterene was not required and proteinuria decreased. A mutation in the β or γ subunits of the ENaC gene was not identified."
