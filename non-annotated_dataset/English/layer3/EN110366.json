  "text": "A 44-year-old of Asian origin female was followed up in our department since December 2015. She was referred by her family doctor due to a left frontal lobe cystic lesion. The patient has been following herbal treatment for her scleroderma since she was 3 years old in China. The patient had an MRI of her brain done in China, because a Chinese medicine practitioner in Toronto told her that she might have something in the brain due to scleroderma. The scleroderma was localised in the left frontal side of her scalp. She did not complain of any symptoms at that time. After observing the MRI, she was taking methotrexate because of her scleroderma in 2015 in Toronto. Her past medical history showed a very limited scleroderma involving her left scalp and a little bit of the left side of her face. There was no skin involvement elsewhere and she denied any symptoms or history of systemic sclerosis. She just highlighted she suffered malnutrition when she was a child. She referred allergy to penicillin.\nShe was followed with CT angiogram and an MRI was done in February 2016. The CT angiogram did not show any vessel abnormality. Figure 2 shows the features that were discovered on the MRI sequences. The patient had a second MRI done on May 2016, which showed a stable lesion. She was visited in the clinic and she did not complain of any new symptoms. She had a repeat MRI every year and on May 2017 the intraaxial lesion showed a mild increase in size of the lesion. The post contrast MRI showed a tiny enhancing nodule along the lateral margin of the lesion. When the patient was seen again in the clinic on September 2017, she complained of mild sensory changes on her right side that have been around for several years and so, wanted the intraaxial lesion to be removed; however, this symptom had not changed recently as she referred. Neurological exam at that time showed GCS 15, motor strength was 5/5 on both upper and lower extremities and reflexes were present, no focal neurological changes were discovered. No sensory deficiency was noticed. The head of plastic surgery was asked to review the case as well as to attend the operating room for an evaluation of the superficial approach for optimum scalp incisional planning and we decided we would stay to the medial side with the opening of the scalp to include a broad-based craniotomy flap that contained this abnormality of the scalp to optimize healing. The patient was informed about the risks of surgery, accepting them and signing the informed consent. The patient was subsequently brought in the operation theatre for a left frontal craniotomy. The incision was planned with the help of plastic surgeons to incorporate the abnormality in the scalp flap with a broad base. Intraoperatively, we used neuronavigation and ultrasound to locate the tumor which was placed below the scalp lesion and skull defect. Brain needle was then used under direct guidance to tap the cyst with hemorrhagic fluid which looked chronic and sent for cell count and analysis. The cyst wall was resected which looked like there was a deposit of hemosiderin. Two areas of nodularity were seen, one was consistent with the ultrasound and was removed. It looked like a thrombosed vein or hemangioblastoma nodule principally. All specimens were sent to pathology for evaluation. Then, the cavity was inspected under the microscope view and no other nodule was visible. A gross total resection was achieved. The examination of the histopathology sections showed white matter containing multiple blood vessels of irregular outline with paper-thin walls lacking smooth muscle and lined by a single layer of endothelial cells. Some of the vessels were obsolete and replaced by hyalinised connective tissue. The white matter demonstrated severe piloid gliosis with numerous Rosenthal fibers. Multiple clusters of hemosiderin-laden macrophages were scattered throughout. CD34 highlighted the thin walled blood vessels. No neoplastic abnormalities were present. Final diagnosis was a cavernous angioma."
