  "text": "An HIV-infected female with a history of intravenous drug use presented with a three month history of abdominal pain, distension, and fever. Computerized tomography of the abdomen revealed a large multicystic right kidney mass. During surgical exploration an intrarenal abscess was identified. Cultures revealed the presence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Histopathological examination demonstrated xanthogranulomatous disease. The patient was successfully treated with nephrectomy and a prolonged antibiotic combination regimen with vancomycin and linezolid."
