  "text": "A 22-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency department after a road traffic collision. Primary assessment and secondary surgery demonstrated an isolated shoulder injury involving the glenoid. Three-dimensional imaging was performed and revealed an intra-articular glenoid fracture with the involvement of the superior suspensory apparatus of the shoulder, not fitting into known classification systems. He underwent an arthroscopically assisted percutaneous screw fixation, which resulted in reduction of the suspensory apparatus and the glenoid fossa."
