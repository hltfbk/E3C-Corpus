  "text": "A 40-year-old Pakistani Asian woman who had no evidence of liver cirrhosis presented in April 2016 for a diagnostic workup of ascites, massive splenomegaly, and pancytopenia. An abdominal ultrasound followed by computed tomography angiography showed a giant aneurysm in her splenic artery and another smaller one in her portal vein. She underwent splenectomy and excision of the splenic artery aneurysm. Surgical findings included a giant splenic artery aneurysm pressing on her portal vein and causing its aneurysmal dilatation. On her first review in July 2016, she was generally in good health, ascites had subsided, and her full blood count was normal. Her portal vein aneurysmal dilatation, which was presumed to be secondary to the pressure effect from the splenic artery aneurysm, had shrunken remarkably in size."
