  "text": "We herein present a case of a 37-year-old female patient who was known to have a posterior occipital lesion (low-grade glioma with pilocytic features) and underwent occipital craniectomy followed by supratentorial approach for debulking of the tumor under general anesthesia in a sitting position. The patient developed upper airway edema along with extreme macroglossia immediately following extubation, with increasing difficulty in ventilation. Re-intubation was impossible, and urgent tracheostomy was performed. In the intensive care unit (ICU), the macroglossia worsened, and the patient developed sepsis with multi-organ failure and died 16 days postoperatively."
