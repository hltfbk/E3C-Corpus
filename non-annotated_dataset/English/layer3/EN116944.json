  "text": "A 57-year-old Asian man with end-stage kidney disease due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease received a living kidney graft from his brother. Because of recurrent infection, chronic pain and enlarged kidneys, he underwent a bilateral nephrectomy with concomitant renal transplantation. The total weight of the removed kidneys was 6kg; the maximal diameter of the larger kidney was 28cm. His left kidney had a 1cm diameter tumor. Pathology indicated papillary renal cell carcinoma. At the time of this report, the transplant kidney function was normal with no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis."
