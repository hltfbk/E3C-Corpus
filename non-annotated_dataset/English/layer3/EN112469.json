  "text": "We report a 3-year-old male with global developmental delay, anemia, and mild dysmorphic facial features. Clinical chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing of the proband detected a heterozygous 1.21â€‰Mb deletion at chromosome 3q29, consistent with a diagnosis of the 3q29 microdeletion syndrome. Interestingly, subsequent parental testing determined that the pathogenic deletion was inherited from his otherwise healthy mother who had a history of learning disabilities. The chromosome 3q29 microdeletion was not detected in the healthy older sibling of the proband by CMA testing, nor was it prenatally detected in a subsequent maternal pregnancy."
