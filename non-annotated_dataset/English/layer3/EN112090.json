  "text": "A total of four patients from two families were included. The average age at onset was 5.9 years. All patients had no signs of eye or skin problems, such as uveitis, rash, folliculitis and dermal abscess. Prior to the recognition of HA20, P1 was diagnosed with SLE, liver fibrosis and hypothyroidism. She also had no oral, genital or perineal ulcers. P2 was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease-related arthritis (IBD-RA). He had a perianal abscess but no oral or genital ulcers. P3, the father of P1 and P2, only had mild oral ulcers, arthralgia, and archosyrinx. P4 was diagnosed with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in two families. WES revealed heterozygous c.559C > T in the TNFAIP3 gene in P1, P2 and P3, while the c.259C > T mutation in the TNFAIP3 gene was identified in P4. The c.259C > T mutations is novel."
