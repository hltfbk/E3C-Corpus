  "text": "A 46-year-old West Indian man presented to our hospital with evidence of a significant upper gastrointestinal bleed. He gave a recent history of jaundice, constitutional symptoms and back pain. Ultrasonography revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas with resultant common bile duct dilatation. The patient required urgent surgical intervention for ongoing bleeding at which time a biopsy of the pancreas was taken. Histological analysis revealed a plasmacytoma of the pancreas. A blood film showing rouleaux formation and a skeletal survey demonstrating multiple lytic lesions confirmed multiple myeloma. Before further evaluation or treatment was carried out, the patient defaulted from follow-up and died from his illness seven months later."
