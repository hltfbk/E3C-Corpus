  "text": "We report a case of pathological fractures at multiple sites: The vertebral column, proximal shaft of femur, and contralateral fracture neck of femur. This patient presented with typical features of multiple myeloma, but on complete evaluation was found to be due to extensive metastases in the bones secondary to adenocarcinoma, the primary site of which remained unknown, despite extensive search and evaluation, making it a case of carcinoma of unknown primary."
