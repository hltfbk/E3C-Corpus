  "text": "A 10-year-old girl presented with unilateral flatfoot and unusual shoe wear of few years duration. A TPT rupture was diagnosed. After observing a 3-4 mm superficial scar behind medial malleolus, and after a lot of questioning, her mother remembered an abrasion she had sustained 6 years ago playing in a park.She was successfully treated by flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon transfer and obtained and maintained a nice longitudinal arch."
