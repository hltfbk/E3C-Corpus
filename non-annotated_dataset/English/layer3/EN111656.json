  "text": "A previously healthy 10 year-old Asian boy presented with 2 months of easy bruising. Review of systems was negative for any constitutional symptoms. On examination, he appeared well but had numerous large ecchymoses. He had no appreciable lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. The liver was palpable 1.5 cm below the costal margin. A complete blood count (CBC) showed: platelets = 17 × 109/L, hemoglobin = 128 g/L, white blood cell count = 5.43 × 109/L, and neutrophils = 1.63 × 109/L. A blood smear was reported as normal. Urate was 370 umol/L and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 803 U/L. The child was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. The following day, the blood smear was reviewed by a hematopathologist who identified blasts. A bone marrow aspiration (BMA) confirmed the diagnosis of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia."
