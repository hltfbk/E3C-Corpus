  "text": "A 31-year-old male presented with clinical partial gut obstruction (epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting). The physical examination showed a palpable ill-defined mass on the left side of the abdomen. The computed tomography scan revealed a multiseptated cystic tumor at the retroperitoneal area. First, he underwent gastrojejunostomy to relieve the symptoms and was referred to a tertiary-care hospital. The second operation revealed a 10-cm solid-cystic mass originating from the third part of the duodenum and adhering to the abdominal aorta and pancreas. Segmental duodenectomy was performed. The pathological diagnosis was a mature cystic teratoma. The patient was asymptomatic at 5 mo after the operation."
