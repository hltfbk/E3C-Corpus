  "text": "Keratoacanthoma in an 86-year-old patient was treated with intralesional bleomycin combined with electroporation. Treatment consisted ofÂ local application of shorty and intense electric pulses followed by local injection of bleomycin. Electroporation was always well tolerated by the patient, with no significant complaints, and the tumor had completely regressed by day 71 of the follow-up."
