  "text": "We present an additional, fourth case of an AVM of the ureter, clinically presented as asymptomatic haematuria and an obstructive process in the left ureter. Ureteroscopic evaluation revealed a fibroepithelial polypoid-like lesion in the proximal ureter. After biopsy showed a benign lesion, the lesion was treated with the 2-Î¼m continuous wave (cw) thulium laser. Histopathological examination revealed a polypoid laesion caused by a circumscribed arteriovenous malformation. Almost four years after operation the patient remains asymptomatic and free of recurrence."
