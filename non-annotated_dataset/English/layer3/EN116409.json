  "text": "The authors report a rare case of vasculo-Behcet's disease with multiple and recurrent pseudoaneurysms in large arteries, but without affecting the venous system. The patient underwent three rounds of surgery, but developed a new pseudoaneurysm after each operation in short term. However, the patient was successfully treated with a combination of prednisone and immunosuppressive agents."
