  "text": "A 60-year-old white female presented with bilateral blurred vision for few days. Fundus examination showed multiple, yellow-white placoid lesions at the posterior pole of both eyes. The placoid lesions were also evident on Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT), Fluorescein Angiography (FA), Fundus Autofluorescence (AF), and ICG-A. A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed and the diagnosis of APMPPE was made based on imaging and clinical features. Notably, all the lesions detected by FA, AF and OCT corresponded to focal areas of hypofluorescence seen on ICG-A, whereas several additional hypofluorescent areas that were not associated with FA, AF or OCT abnormalities, were also detected with ICG-A. On follow-up, the regression of outer retinal abnormalities detected on OCT preceded the restoration of choroidal perfusion abnormalities in the corresponding locations on ICG-A. This long-standing choroidal perfusion defect could not be detected with OCT. EDI-OCT scans revealed characteristic choriocapillaris changes beneath the placoid lesions and an increase in choroidal thickness during the acute phase, with subsequent decrease in the inactive stage of the disease."
