  "text": "A 62-year-old woman presented with blurred near vision 10 days after trans-sphenoidal surgery (TSS) for a pituitary tumor. Around the same time, she experienced intercurrent hyponatremia. The corrected visual acuity of both eyes was 20/20, the spherical equivalent of the right eye was -2.125 diopters, and of the left eye was -2.0 diopters before TSS. However, 11 days after TSS, the spherical equivalent of the right eye changed to -0.75 diopters, and that of left eye changed to -1.125 diopters without hyperglycemia. There were no changes in the corrected visual acuity during the follow-up."
