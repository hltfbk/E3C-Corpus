  "text": "A 78-year-old female patient presented to our department with a large soft tissue defect on the frontotemporal left side. The lesion was about 3 cm in diameter with exposed bone and inflammatory soft tissue on the edges of the defect. About 35 years ago, she had undergone a combined neurosurgery with skull trepanation and radiotherapy for an oligodendroglioma. Three years ago, sandwich transplantation with the dermal template and meshed skin graft failed. Now she re-presented with inflammatory ulcer borders. A complex defect repair was performed after exclusion of a second malignancy."
