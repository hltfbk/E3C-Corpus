  "text": "A 67-year-old man presented with edema of both lower extremities. He received pazopanib therapy for recurrent metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) for 17 months. Laboratory examinations revealed 7484.58 mg/day of 24-h urine protein, 434 mg/dL of serum cholesterol, and 2.9 g/dL of serum albumin. He was diagnosed with NS, and pazopanib treatment was discontinued. Four months later, he completely recovered from NS. He was then treated with temsirolimus and nivolumab sequentially for > 26 months. Pazopanib was re-introduced following disease progression, and demonstrated antitumor effects for 7 months without NS recurrence."
