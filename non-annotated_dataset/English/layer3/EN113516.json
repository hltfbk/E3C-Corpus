  "text": "A 72-year-old Caucasian man presented with ciliary body melanoma of the left eye and underwent curative-intent enucleation but six months later developed diffuse hepatic metastases. He initially was treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every two weeks for four cycles but restaging scan showed a significant progression of the disease with increasing LDH. With the FDA approval for the combination of nivolumab 1mg/kg with Ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every three weeks for metastatic melanoma, this combination was given for four cycles with continuous rise in LDH to 993 unit/L (110-220 unit/L) until finishing cycle four of the treatment. Three weeks later, maintainence nivolumab 3mg/kg was initiated but two weeks later, he developed grade 4 liver toxicityÂ with ALT 1565 unit/L (0-55 unit/L). A presumptive diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis was made, nivolumab was stopped and oral prednisone 1mg/kg was started with quick resolution of elevated transaminases. Restaging abdominal MRI one month after the first and last dose of maintenance nivolumab showed PR and continuous shrinkage of the metastatic lesions with no hypermetabolic activity even on PET/CT. He is 22 months' post-treatment and continues to do well without any evidence of active disease."
