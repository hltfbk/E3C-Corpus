  "text": "A 38-year-old man was admitted due to anterior abdominal wall nodule for 1 month. The nodule and intraperitoneal mass were resected and diagnosed IADSRCT. The patient received six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy and his CT scan revealed metastasis in the right inguinal lymph node and omental lymph node. Anlotinib was then recommended. Anlotinib significantly reduced the lymph nodes after four cycles. The patient continued to use anlotinib as maintenance therapy, and the patient was in good condition. The side effects of anlotinib were high triglycerides and fatigue. However, its toxicity was controllable and tolerable."
