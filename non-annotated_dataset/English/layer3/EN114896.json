  "text": "We report the clinical course of a 56Â years old Chinese lady who presented with over anti-coagulation and acute kidney injury while on warfarin therapy for permanent atrial fibrillation and mechanical valve replacement. Renal biopsy was performed as the acute kidney injury was persistent despite normalization of the International Normalized Ratio and the diagnosis of warfarin related nephropathy was made. Temporary interruption of anti-coagulation, in combination with oral N-acetylcysteine resulted in subsequent stabilization of renal function."
