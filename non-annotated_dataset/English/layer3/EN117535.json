  "text": "We report three Caucasian patients (one female and two male patients; ages: 52, 54 and 60 years) with decompensated liver cirrhosis, who showed newly infarcted regenerative nodules at necropsy. Two of them suffered from gastric variceal bleeding. Histopathology showed extensive infarction in all three cases.Hemorrhage and inflammatory changes were also observed around the infarcted regenerative nodules."
