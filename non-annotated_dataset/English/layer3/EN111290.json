  "text": "In this case report, we describe a 23-year-old patient with an acute onset of chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations and dizziness starting 2 days prior to presentation to the emergency department. The patient was initially treated for presumed pulmonary embolism overnight while awaiting CTPA the next morning. However, further examination by the inpatient medical team demonstrated a continuous machinery cardiac murmur. Subsequent echocardiography demonstrated an acutely ruptured SVA with shunting to the right atrium. Emergency surgical repair resulted in an excellent outcome for the patient."
