  "text": "We report the case of a 47-year-old North Afican man with penile metastases from a rectal adenocarcinoma, which was discovered 4 months after abdominoperineal resection. A penile biopsy was carried out and established the metastatic nature. He underwent palliative chemotherapy treatment. He was still alive 4 months after diagnosis of penile metastases."
