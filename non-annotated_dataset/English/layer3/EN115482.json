  "text": "An otherwise healthy adolescent boy presented with a 3-year history of a slowly enlarging painless thoracic mass. A general physical examination was normal, aside from a painless 10 cm mobile, hard mass along the posterior spine in the region of T4 through T6. Musculoskeletal and neurovascular examinations were normal. An ultrasound suggested a solid, cylindrically shaped mass with diffuse ossification. The mass was resected, and the pathology revealed ossifying parosteal lipoma without evidence of malignancy."
