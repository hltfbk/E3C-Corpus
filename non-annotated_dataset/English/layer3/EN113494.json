  "text": "We present a case of a 27 - year - old pregnant female patient with a congenital melanocytic nevus, which increased significantly in size, during her pregnancy. Estrogen levels increase during pregnancy and clinical evidence has suggested that melanocytes are estrogen - responsive. Nevi in a pregnant patient would exhibit increased expression of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) and thus enhanced the potential to respond to altered estrogen levels."
