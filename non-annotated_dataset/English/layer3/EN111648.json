  "text": "A 67-year-old woman was admitted to our department for the treatment of right empyema. Chest computed tomography showed fluid collection in three independent spaces within the right thoracic cavity. It was assumed that a firm adhesion between the lung and chest wall was developed because about 7Â weeks passed since the onset. Therefore, we decided to use CBCT to completely debride three empyema cavities separately by VATS. One cavity was only in a narrow range with the chest wall, and it was located on the back of cost rib cartilage. By clicking any intended anatomical structures on CBCT images, the position was readily depicted by lase projection on the body surface, which helped to place the best skin incision. Moreover, in other cavities, CBCT after initial debridement showed insufficiently dissected cavity. Additional debridement resulted in a successful shrinkage of the empyema cavity."
