  "text": "Here we report on an HLH case caused by 1 bp deletion in gene SH2D1A. Patient was a 3-years-old boy and had fever for more than 8 days. Splenomegaly and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow were observed in examination. The results of the blood analysis suggested the diagnosis of HLH. Genetic test based on high throughput amplicon sequencing was then conducted by targeting all six known HLH-causing genes simultaneously. It took only one single day to accomplish the amplicon sequencing library preparation, sequencing and data analysis. Finally, a novel 1 bp deletion in gene SH2D1A was discovered. The result was also confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The result of the genetic test served as a good basis for further diagnosis of HLH."
