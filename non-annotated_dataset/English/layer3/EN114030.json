  "text": "A 30-year-old woman has been admitted for dyspnea and cyanosis. The data which had been obtained from echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and angio-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested the existence of an important aneurysm of the left pulmonary artery associated with a regular Fallot's disease with a pulmonic stenosis. We have noticed the presence of a small restrictive patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Therefore, the patient was referred to surgical correction."
