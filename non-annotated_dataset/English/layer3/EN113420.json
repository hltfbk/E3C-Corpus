  "text": "A total of 10 skeletally immature patients with tibial spine avulsion of Meyers and McKeever Type 2 and 3 were included in the study. The knee was arthroscopically cleared of hematoma. The avulsed tibial insertion of anterior cruciate ligament was reduced and held in place with tibial guide. By drilling guide wire through the tibia, reduced fragment, a fiber wire was passed. The avulsed fragment was tied on a suture post on tibia. Outcome was evaluated radiologically and clinically (Lysholm score, pivot shift, and KT 1000) at 12 months after surgery. All cases attained full range of motion, stable knee and could return to previous level of activity. The mean pre-operative Lysholm score of 50.8 ± 1.4 (35-59) improved to 96.3 ± 2.9 (92-100). The mean pre-operative anterior translation of tibia (measured by KT 1000) of 7.6 ± 1.26 improved significantly to mean of 3.3 ± 0.82 mm after surgery."
