  "text": "A 70-year-old Japanese man presented with gastrointestinal bleeding to our hospital. Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a protruding lesion in the gastric body. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of biopsy specimens from this lesion revealed sheets of spindle cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed that these cells were positive for S-100 protein and negative for c-Kit and smooth muscle actin. Because mitosis was diffusely visible, this tumor was diagnosed as a gastric malignant schwannoma. Distal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection was performed and the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. However, five months after the surgery, he died from multiple liver metastases."
