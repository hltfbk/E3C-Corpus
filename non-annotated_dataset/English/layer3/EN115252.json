  "text": "A female newborn with respiratory distress syndrome caused by a large left cervical mass. Intubation was difficult due to tracheal deviation. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a left cervical cyst displacing the trachea and esophagus laterally. Surgical excision was performed via a cervical approach on the 5th day, and pathological examination revealed a bronchogenic cyst. The patient's course was complicated by left vocal cord paralysis and necrotic lesions in the glottic and subglottic regions; she required a tracheostomy on the 13th day. Inflammatory stenosis in the subglottic region required balloon dilation once, 20 days later. Proximal esophageal stenosis induced transient upper airway obstruction with salivary stasis. Decannulation was performed at 2 months and the patient was discharged 10 days later."
