  "text": "Here we describe a case of bacteraemia and possible endocarditis in a 64-year-old white British man caused by a newly identified genomospecies of Capnocytophaga in a patient subsequently diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus. The source of the bacteraemia was presumed to be from the patient's own oral flora."
