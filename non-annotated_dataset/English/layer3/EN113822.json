  "text": "We present a 7-year-old Bahraini boy who sustained blunt trauma to his abdomen. He presented with abdominal pain and vomiting. His examination revealed abdominal distension and an epigastric bruise. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography reported grade III liver injury, grade I bilateral renal injury, a suspicion of splenic injury, and a grade III to IV pancreatic injury. He was admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and was treated conservatively. Because he was stable, he was discharged to the surgical ward at day 3. At day 18 he developed a pancreatic pseudocyst that was aspirated and recurred at day 25 when a pigtail catheter was inserted. He was kept on total parenteral nutrition through a peripherally inserted central catheter. The pigtail catheter was removed on day 36 and a low fat diet was started by day 44. He was discharged home at day 55 in good health. Out-patient follow-up and serial abdominal ultrasound showed resolution of the cyst and normalization of blood tests."
