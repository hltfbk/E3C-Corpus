  "text": "A 10- year-old girl with consanguineous parents suffered from congenital camptodactyly and progressive swollen and painful joints. Her father and his sister had similar childhood-onset joint complaints. Laboratory tests showed no signs of inflammation but showed persistent low protein- and IgG- levels, indicating a secondary immunodeficiency. Increased alpha antitrypsin clearance confirmed PLE. Abdominal ultrasound with Doppler showed hepatomegaly and portal hypertension. Echocardiography suggested constrictive pericarditis. However, heart catheterization could not confirm this. Ultrasound and X-ray examination of the joints combined with a puncture of the synovial fluid were performed. These results, combined with the clinical presentation and the consanguinity, suggested CACP syndrome. Due to excessive enteral protein losses, the patient was treated with Cotrimoxazol prophylaxis and immunoglobulin supplements. These supplements were inadequate to achieve normal IgG values. As constrictive pericarditis with subsequent PLE was the best explanation for the excessive IgG losses, pericardiectomy was performed with good results. Genetic testing in our patient was complicated but revealed a pathogenic mutation within the repeat sequence in exon 7 of the PRG4 gene."
