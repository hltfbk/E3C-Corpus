  "text": "We report the case of a combined esophageal perforation and dissection in a 45-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of relapsing periods of dysphagia since her childhood. The clinical course in this patient was complicated by progression to a second perforation, which made a definitive surgical management by esophagectomy necessary."
