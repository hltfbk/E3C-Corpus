  "text": "A case of abdominal cocoon with cryptorchidism and seminoma was diagnosed and treated in our hospital. The patient had no symptoms except occasional abdominal pain. He underwent laparoscopy because of bilateral cryptorchidism and seminoma in the right testis. During the surgery, he was diagnosed with abdominal cocoon due to the thick fibrous tissues which was tightly adhered and encased part of intestine like a cocoon. Enterolysis and bilateral cryptochiectomy were performed after the diagnosis and nutritional and symptomatic support was provided after the surgery. The patient recovered well and was discharged soon. The postoperative pathological examination confirmed the presence of bilateral cryptorchidism and seminoma in the patient's right testis."
