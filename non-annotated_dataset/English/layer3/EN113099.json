  "text": "A 64-year-old man noticed an acne-like nodule in the left parotid region. It was painless, but it increased to a maximum diameter of 4.5 cm over 2 years. Clinically, left parotid gland carcinoma was suspected, and fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed. Clusters of epithelial cells were observed in a necrotic background, and malignant epithelial cells derived from salivary glands were suspected. Histologically, the resected tumor was diagnosed as proliferating pilomatricoma composed of basophilic cells and shadow cells apart from the parotid gland. However, on a re-evaluation of the cytological specimens, the irregular-shaped epithelial cells were considered to be from basophilic cells. Shadow cells with nuclear disappearance were also confirmed. Tumor recurrence and metastasis have not been observed in the four years since surgery."
