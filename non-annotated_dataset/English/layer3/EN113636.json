  "text": "A 64-year-old male presented after testing positive for fecal occult blood at a medical check-up. A biopsy demonstrated the presence of a NET and endoscopic submucosal dissection was undertaken. Histologic examination revealed that a well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma was present in addition to the NET. Furthermore, histological transition between the two tumors was evident. Accordingly, this case was considered to be a composite tumor comprising NET and adenocarcinoma."
