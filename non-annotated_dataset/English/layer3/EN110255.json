  "text": "Observation 1: Ms. V.B. Caribbean 26 years (in 2012) with past history of Bypass in November 29 th 2009, uterine fibroid and normal delivery in March 2012. She has been hospitalized from the 14th to 21 st September for a chronic progressive muscle weakness of both lower limbs since mid-August. Clinical examination at admission revealed symmetrical paresis of both lower limbs with muscle strength quoted at 2/5 proximally and 3/5 distally with a positive Tabouret's sign, absence of knee jerk and ankle jerk reflexes with no idiomuscular response (deltoids and psoas muscles). There were no Babinski sign and no systemic signs. Laboratory tests showed increased CPK level (20,591 IU/L), positive C-reactive protein (15 mg/l) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (13 at the first hour). The dosage of anti-parietal cell and anti-SRP antibodies were positives while the dosage of anti-JO1 and antinuclear antibodies were negatives except the insignificant presence of anti-SSA antibodies. Infectious serologies (HIV 1 and 2, HTLV 1 and 2, hepatitis A, hepatitis C, trichinosis, syphilis, Lyme, streptococci, Coxsackie virus, Echovirus) were negatives. We noted the presence of toxoplasmosis IgG (0.1 IU/ml) but no IgM. Epstein Barr virus serology revealed previous infection and we related the presence of anti-HBs antibodies (402 IU/l) to a previous immunization. The endocrine tests were normal (TSH, ACTH, estradiol, IGF1, prolactin, FSH, LH). The standard short synacthen test was negative. Cardiac ultrasound performed on the 17th September was normal. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and thighs showed hypersignal of pelvis and thighs muscles indicate an inflammatory myopathy. The electromyogram showed pure myogenic pattern. We performed a surgical muscle biopsy at the left thigh which revealed muscular alterations related to inflammatory myopathy. The diagnosis of anti-SRP antibody myopathy was done. Following the worsening of the muscle weakness, the patient was readmitted on the 05th September. Laboratory tests showed persistent high CPK level (18721 IU/L), elevated transaminases with AST (about 10 times) and ALT (167 IU/l), normal serum electrolytes, positive C - reactive protein (15 mg/l) and increased fibrinogen level (4.37). She received a treatment based on Methylprednisolone at initial dose of 500 mg and two others doses of 250 mg and Intravenous Immunoglobulin to 2g/kg/treatment. The treatment was well tolerated clinically and biologically (post-Intravenous Immunoglobulin CPK level was 7435 IU/l) but there were no regression of the muscle weakness. She has been discharged on the 12th October with corticosteroid and associated treatment. Observation 2: Ms. N.C. Senegalese 35 year old (in 2016) with past history of anti-SRP antibody myopathy diagnosed in 2012 and normal delivery. She was hospitalized from the 10th to 29th April 2015 for a muscle pain and weakness of the lower limbs started 5 months prior to hospitalization. Indeed seven months after the delivery, she has been re admitted for a muscle pain and weakness of the lower limbs leading to sleep deprivation. She has stopped the treatment during pregnancy without significant change. Clinical exam found muscle paresis of both lower limbs with muscular strength quoted at 1/5 proximally and 4/5 distally. The knee jerk, ankle jerk reflexes and idiomuscular response were absents bilaterally as well as the Babinski sign. Laboratory tests had showed high CPK level (17,651 IU/l), elevated transaminases with AST (about 10 times) and (ALT 140 IU/l), positive C-reactive protein (36mg/l), low creatinine level (75 mg/dL) and normal serum electrolyte. Controlled laboratory tests done in January 2013 showed: very high CPK level (12,750 IU/l) with positive C-reactive protein 36 mg/l and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 26 at first hour. The dosage of anti-SRP antibodies was positive while antinuclear antibodies and anti-JO1 antibodies were negative. Infectious serologies (HIV 1, 2, hepatitis B) were negative. The hormonal tests were normal (TSH, ACTH, prolactin, FSH, LH) as well as cardiac ultrasound. The electromyogram showed a pure myogenic pattern. She received Solumedrol with initial dose of 500 mg and two others doses of 250 mg. The treatment has been well tolerated clinically and biologically, without muscle paresis improvement. She has been discharged on corticosteroid and associated treatment."
