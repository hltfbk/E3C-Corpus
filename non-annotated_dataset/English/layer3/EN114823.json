  "text": "A 57-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our hospital with severe paraparesis, gait disturbance, and sensory loss secondary to a relapsing epidural mass. Examination of a biopsy specimen revealed a lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with fibrosis and an immunoglobulin G4-positive plasma cell ratio of over 50 %, which are compatible with a diagnosis of immunoglobulin G4-related inflammatory pseudotumor. Our patient was successfully treated with systemic and epidural administration of glucocorticoids."
