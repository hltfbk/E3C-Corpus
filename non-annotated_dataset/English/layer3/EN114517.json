  "text": "We report the case of a 51-year-old man in whom uncontrollable vomiting, treatment with omeprazole and thiazide, and renal impairment lead to a severe hypomagnesemia (magnesium below the level of detection in blood tests), which secondarily caused Wernicke's encephalopathy and vasospasm in multiple cerebral arteries (seen with cerebral angiography and CT angiography) that presented with a complete right hemisphere neurological deficit. These disturbances completely resolved when magnesium levels were normalized and subsequent neuroimaging tests confirmed the resolution of angiographic changes."
