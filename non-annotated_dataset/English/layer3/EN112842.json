  "text": "This article reports a case of facial EG which was similar to Noma in a malnourished child: a 16-month old girl with fever, cough, weight loss, watery stool and swelling on right cheek. She was febrile, pale, wasted with bilateral pitting pedal oedema. She had a solitary circumscribed round necrotic lesion, with surrounding hyperaemia on the right malar area which extended to destroy the right ala nasi. No intra-oral rashes but she had left ear discharge. She received blood transfusion, antibiotics, antiseptic wound care and nutritional rehabilitation."
