  "text": "A 54-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital for a space-occupying lesion in the right kidney for 2 d upon ultrasound examination. The patient had no cold or fever; no frequency, urgency or pain of urination; and no other discomfort. The results of a hemogram, blood biochemistry, and tumor markers were in the normal range. The patient was examined by computed tomography (CT), which indicated the presence of a soft tissue density shadow with a diameter of approximately 6.8 cm in the right renal pelvis area, showing uneven enhancement. Ultrasound indicated a cystic solid mass of approximately 6.8 cm Ã— 6.5 cm in the right kidney, with an unclear boundary and irregular shape. Meanwhile, color Doppler flow imaging showed dotted blood flow signals in the periphery and interior. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) showed \"slow in and fast out\" hyperenhancement of the right renal mass after contrast agent injection. The postoperative pathological diagnosis was (right kidney) synovial sarcoma. Despite postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, tumor recurrence was detected two years later."
