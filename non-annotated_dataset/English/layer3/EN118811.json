  "text": "We present a case of a 65-year-old woman presenting with a 1-month history of intermittent generalised abdominal pain. Computerised tomography imaging demonstrated intussusception of the small bowel. Histology of the resected small bowel revealed an inflammatory fibroid polyp with evidence of chronic ischaemia related to repeated intussusception. This rare complication of inflammatory fibroid polyps is reviewed."
