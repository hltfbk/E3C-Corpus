  "text": "Our patient, a brazilian retired 64-year-old female, presented to the emergency service with post-prandial food vomiting of undigested content and stabbing abdominal pain with worsening during palpation. Concomitantly, onset of sporadic frontal headache, fatigue, hyporexia, weight loss of 18 kg in the same period, severe pruritus, musculoskeletal pain in the limbs and nocturia. The physical examination showed hypertension (160/80 mmHg) and itchy macules in the lower limb. Initially, the main diagnostic hypotheses were multiple myeloma, hyperparathyroidism and pancreatitis secondary to hypercalcemia, osteolytic neoplasms and other neoplasms that present with hypercalcemia. However, blood count, parathyroid hormone, chest X-ray, immunoglobulins, myelogram and bone marrow biopsy were not compatible with these diagnoses. Meanwhile, 25 OH vitamin D dosage and diluted vitamin D test confirmed the diagnosis of hypervitaminosis D. Hypercalcemic crisis was managed with vigorous hydration (50 ml/kg in 2 h), furosemide, bisphosphonates and blood pressure control with amlodipine and atenolol. Subsequently, the patient was discharged from the outpatient clinic with complete remission of symptoms, weight gain, serum calcium values of 10.76 mg/dL and ionizable calcium values of 6.52 mg/dL."
