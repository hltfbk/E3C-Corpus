  "text": "This 55-year-old male patient with hemiparkinsonism and recurrent bouts of headaches was first diagnosed in 1988. CT scans revealed multiple cystic lesions compressing brainstem and basal ganglia, which were partially resected. Subsequently, the patient was free of complaints for 20â€‰years. In 2009 the patient presented once more with severe unilateral tremor and thalamic pain affecting the right arm. Despite symptomatic treatment with L-Dopa and pramipexole symptoms worsened over time. In 2014 there was further progression with increasing hemiparkinsonism, hemidystonia, unilateral thalamic pain and pyramidal signs. Repeat CT scanning revealed a progression of the cysts as well as secondary hydrocephalus. Following repeat decompression of the brainstem and fenestration of all cystic membranes parkinsonism improved with a MDS- UPDRS III score reduction from 39 to 21. Histology revealed arachnoid cystic material."
