  "text": "A 37-year-old postpartum female was presented at a local hospital and was diagnosed with HER2-positive stage IIIB (cT4N1M0) invasive micropapillary adenocarcinoma in the left breast with left axillary metastatic lymph nodes. The patient failed to respond to two cycles of the doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) regimen but achieved clinical partial response (cPR) after 4 cycles of the combination of pyrotinib, trastuzumab, paclitaxel and cisplatin (PTPC) regimen according to radiologic assessments. Then, she underwent left-side modified radical mastectomy (MRM) and achieved pathologic complete response (pCR), as confirmed by postoperative pathology. The patient held on receiving 2 cycles of the targeted therapy plus chemotherapy with trastuzumab, paclitaxel plus cisplatin (TPC) and adjuvant radiation therapy but continued to receive targeted therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab during the 1-year follow-up period. There has been no clinical evidence of disease progression so far."
