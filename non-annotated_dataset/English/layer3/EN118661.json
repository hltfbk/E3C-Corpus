  "text": "In an 85-year-old Japanese woman, oral moxifloxacin 400 mg daily was initiated for the forearm cellulitis. On the sixth day of oral moxifloxacin administration, monitor electrocardiogram showed prolongation of the corrected QT interval to 523 ms at a rate of 40 beats/min. Electrocardiogram before moxifloxacin therapy showed the corrected QT interval to 460 ms at a rate of 72 beats/min. On the sixth day after moxifloxacin discontinuance, monitor electrocardiogram showed the corrected QT interval to 432 ms at a rate of 70 beats/min."
