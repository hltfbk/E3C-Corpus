  "text": "A 68-years old woman, presenting with weight loss and respiratory symptoms, was diagnosed with a classic KS involving lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. No skin or mucosal lesions were identified, HIV positivity was ruled out. Due to patient's choice, she was kept under surveillance with 3-monthly thorax-abdomen-pelvis computed tomography scan (TAP CT). A first reassessment proved progressive disease (PD) associated with symptoms worsening. A new TAP CT, performed at 5 months from the diagnosis, showed stable disease (SD), with a minor reduction in size of mediastinal lymphadenopathies. A further reassessment, performed 5 months later, resulted in a partial response (PR) despite the absence of any medical treatment. Up to date, the disease is in remission, patient is asymptomatic and still on surveillance."
