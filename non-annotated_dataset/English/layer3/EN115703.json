  "text": "A large Jewish Moroccan family presented with apparently autosomal dominant heredity of bilateral thumb polydactyly in hands and feet combined with post-axial polydactyly type B or type A. Syndactyly was evident in most patients' hands and feet. Apart from head circumference beyond 90th percentile in some of the affected individuals, none had craniofacial dysmorphism. A novel GLI3 c.1802A >â€‰G (p.His601Arg) mutation was found in all affected individuals."
