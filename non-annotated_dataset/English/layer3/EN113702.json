  "text": "We present a case of a 62-year-old woman who experienced enactment behaviors with violent dreams that were associated with increased tonic or phasic chin electromyography activity during REM sleep after treated with duloxetine. RBD symptoms were gradually reduced and completely ceased after discontinuation of duloxetine for 37Â days."
