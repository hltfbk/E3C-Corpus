  "text": "A 19-year-old African female presented with a chronic severe debilitating right lower quadrant abdominal pain refractory to analgesics. Biochemical investigations and imaging studies revealed a non-functional polycystic right kidney and no identifiable pelvicalyceal system or ureter but with preserved renal function. The marked overlap in clinical presentation between unilateral renal cystic disease and multicystic dysplastic kidney in this patient necessitated further investigation to pose an appropriate diagnosis. A right nephrectomy was performed and histopathological analysis of the resected kidney done, the results of which were more consistent with unilateral renal cystic disease. The post-operative course was favorable."
