  "text": "The author presents here a patient with DME for around 20Â years in both eyes, who had undergone pan-retinal and focal photocoagulation, and anti-VEGF therapy in both eyes without resolution of DME. FAc implant in the left, and subsequently in the right eye, provided substantial improvements in edema and visual acuity."
