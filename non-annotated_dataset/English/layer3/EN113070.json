  "text": "A 47-year-old male presented to us with pain and swelling over the left shoulder. The swelling was 11 cm × 15 cm × 8 cm and was hard and tender with rough texture. Radiograph showed large homogenous lesion with irregular but well-defined margins and a ground glass appearance. Magnetic resonance imaging scans showed well-defined borders with the expansion of the bone, with intact overlying cortices and endosteal scalloping. Biopsy confirmed the lesion to be FD. An innovative application of an existing surgical technique to minimize the impact of the residual deformity and dead space left after curettage of the scapula was done. The patient had good clinical and functional outcome at 6-month follow-up."
