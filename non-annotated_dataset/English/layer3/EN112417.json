  "text": "We performed open window thoracostomy for empyema with a huge bronchial stump dehiscence after right pneumonectomy for a large lung cancer. We definitively closed the chest window infected with chronic persistent Pseudomonas aeruginosa via a simple chest closure technique with the remaining residual space, after repairing the bronchial dehiscence using an omental flap and the appearance of healthy granulation tissue throughout the cavity. The patient died of recurrent cancer 10â€‰months after the definitive chest closure. Until the patient died, there were no symptoms or signs suggestive of recurrent empyema."
