  "text": "An asymptomatic 26-year-old male diver was nominated to attend an overseas naval diving course. Prior to this, he had been medically certified to participate in, and had successfully completed other military and recreational diving courses. He had also completed several hyperbaric dives up to a depth of 50 m and 45 recreational dives up to a depth of 30 m. He did not have a history of diving-related injuries or complications. He had never smoked and did not have any medical or congenital conditions, specifically recurrent respiratory infections. As part of pre-course screening requirements, a lateral Chest X-ray was performed, which revealed a left lower lobe pulmonary nodule. This was subsequently diagnosed as a cavitatory left lower lobe intralobar bronchopulmonary sequestration on Computed Tomography Thorax. The diver remains asymptomatic and well at the time of writing and has been accepted to participate in another overseas course involving only dry diving in a hyperbaric chamber, with no prerequisites for him to undergo surgery."
