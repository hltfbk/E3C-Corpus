  "text": "A 54-year old male presented to our department with a 5-day history of sudden onset colicky abdominal pain associated with vomiting, progressive abdominal distension and fever. Laparotomy through a chevron incision was performed and findings at operation included a gallbladder, which was necrotic and gangrenous, not attached to the liver by any mesentery. It was hanging by the attachments of cystic duct and cystic artery only, with a 360-degree clockwise torsion."
