  "text": "A 64-year-old male presented with two episodes of severe sepsis secondary to right sided otitis media. During the first episode, he suffered an episode of otogenic pneumococcal sepsis requiring intensive care admission. A year later, he suffered another episode of otogenic intracranial sepsis with evidence of encephalitis, which also required intensive care input. He underwent surgical management of his otitis media with a right myringotomy followed by grommet insertion."
