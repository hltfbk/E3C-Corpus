  "text": "A 32-year old, generally fit and well, female presented to us with gradually deteriorating vision in her right eye. Visual acuity was counting fingers in the right eye and, 20/30 in the left eye. Right eye fundus examination showed a full thickness, yellowish-white foveal lesion, and significant vitreous haze. Left eye examination was normal. Upon direct questioning, the patient disclosed history of backstreet abortion 3 weeks prior to the onset of her ocular symptoms. She underwent vitreous tap and intravitreal antibiotics (amphotericin B, 5 μg/0.5 ml). Vitreous culture showed profuse growth of Candida albicans. Because her condition was progressively deteriorating, she underwent 25 g vitrectomy plus repeat intravitreal amphotericin B under general anaesthesia. Three weeks post-vitrectomy, vitreous inflammation resolved completely, and the sub-retinal abscess healed with a macular scar formation. Over a follow-up of 4 years, no recurrences were observed."
