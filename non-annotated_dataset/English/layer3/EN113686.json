  "text": "We present a case of a 35-year-old female of the Indian subcontinent who had complaints of pain in left hip and limp since 1 year. The first clinical and radiological diagnosis was tuberculosis of the hip. However, higher imaging modalities revealed the diagnosis of hydatid disease of hip. The patient underwent surgical debridement and anti-helminthic chemotherapy. At 3-year follow-up, the patient was disease- free."
