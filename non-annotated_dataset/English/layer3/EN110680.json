  "text": "Here, we report on a 19-year-old female with the clinical diagnosis of aHUS, who has unaffected consanguineous parents and an older sibling who was deceased from aHUS when she was seven months old. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by evaluation of detected variants for functional significance, using several online prediction tools. Next, in order to confirm the detected pathogenic variant in proband and segregation analysis in her family, Sanger sequencing was done. The novel variant was analyzed in terms of its impact on the protein 3-dimensional structure by computational structural modeling. The results revealed that the proband carried a novel homozygous missense variant in DGKE located in exon 6 of the gene (NM_003647.3, c.942C > G [p.Asn314Lys]), and in silico analysis anticipated it as damaging. Protein computational study confirmed the influence of potential pathogenic variant on structural stability and protein function."
