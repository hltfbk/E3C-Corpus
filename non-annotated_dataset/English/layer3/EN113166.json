  "text": "We report a term neonate with Down syndrome. The infant developed vomiting and cyanosis with each feeding soon after birth. Plain film abdominal X-rays showed a nonspecific gas-filled stomach and small bowel. Duodenal atresia and an anomalous common bile were noted on an upper GI study and exploratory laparotomy."
