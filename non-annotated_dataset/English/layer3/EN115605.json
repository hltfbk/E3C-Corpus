  "text": "A 19-year-old Japanese man presented with breathing difficulties and left testis enlargement and he was diagnosed with a yolk sac tumor following a left orchiectomy. At the time of diagnosis, multiple lung metastases were apparent on computed tomography, and serum alpha-fetoprotein level was elevated to 10,245 ng/ml. The patient received three postoperative courses of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin and etoposide and cisplatin respectively and a complete response was obtained. Four years after surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to a sudden seizure. High alpha-fetoprotein levels (539 ng/ml) were evident and magnetic resonance imaging suggested a 45-mm single brain tumor in the right parietal lobe, for which surgery was performed. The pathological diagnosis was yolk sac tumor. The alpha-fetoprotein level remained normal at 2 months after operation. There was no recurrence 24 months post-operation."
