  "text": "We report a regimen for decolonization of gastrointestinal carriage of VRE by a combination of environmental disinfection, patient isolation, bowel preparation to wash-out the fecal bacterial population using polyethylene glycol, a five-day course of oral absorbable linezolid and non-absorbable daptomycin to suppress any remaining VRE, and subsequent oral Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to maintain the colonization resistance in four patients, including two patients with end-stage liver cirrhosis, one patient with complication post liver transplant, and one patient with complicated infective endocarditis. All patients had clearance of VRE immediately after decolonization, and 3 of them remained VRE-free for 23 to 137 days of hospitalization, despite subsequent use of intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics without anti-VRE activity."
