  "text": "As a result of multiple fractures during childhood, this adult patient with OI presented with a short stature. The radiographs revealed a displaced, intertrochanteric fracture with subtrochanteric extension of the left femur. The intramedullary canal was narrow, the femur presented with a severe bowing deformity, and the bone quality was poor. The implant of choice was plating using the reversed less invasive stabilisation system-distal femur (LISS-DF) technique. This technique was introduced for the management of subtrochanteric fractures in the elderly with poor bone stock. In addition, a locking plate attached to the LISS-DF allowed for additional screw placement at the apex of the curvature of the femur although the plate was not in line with the femur at this site. Cerclages were used for metaphyseal reduction and fixation. 4-month postoperatively, the patient was ambulatory without any assistance with full weight bearing. At the latest follow-up 1-year postoperatively, the patient was still free of complaints and at her preinjury activity level."
