  "text": "We report a case of a 52-year-old man, on long-term therapy with HU for essential thrombocytosis, with several concurrent skin lesions. Despite the perennial use of HU, the cutaneous changes were neglected. The local dermatological examination revealed oval perimalleolar ulcer on the right leg, with dimensions 6 x 4 cm, clearly demarcated from the surroundings with regular margins, periulcerous erythema, with very deep and highly fibrinous bed of the ulcer, positive for bacterial infection. The ulcer was treated with topical wound therapy with alginate and parenteral antibiotics. The extended dermatological screening also showed two nummular lesions in the right brachial region, presenting as erythematous papules with sharp margins from the surrounding skin, gritty desquamation and dotted hyperpigmentations inside the lesion. Further dermoscopy and biopsy investigations confirmed a diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. Nasal actinic keratosis was also noted. The patient was advised for discontinuing or substituting the HU therapy."
