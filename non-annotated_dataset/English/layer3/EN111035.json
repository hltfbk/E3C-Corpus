  "text": "The patient presented 30 minutes after onset of his symptoms and quickly developed hypoxia and hypotension refractory to intramuscular epinephrine, intravenous fluids, methylprednisolone, and supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask. He ultimately required intubation, an epinephrine infusion, and admission to the medical intensive care unit."
