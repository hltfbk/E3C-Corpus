  "text": "Non-surgical management was selected because of suspected minor leakage. A follow-up CT cystography on day 21 showed a large urinoma. In the sagittal reconstruction CT images, the bladder was displaced downwards. Surgery was performed. Surgical findings showed that the bladder neck and the urethra were not anchored because of a laceration in the urogenital diaphragm. The bladder base had descended to the inferior margin of the pubic bone and a laceration of about 3 cm was found in the anterior surface of the bladder neck. The laceration was sutured, and the wall of the urinoma was extensively resected. The postoperative course was uneventful."
