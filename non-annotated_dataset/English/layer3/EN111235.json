  "text": "We report a 38-year-old woman who presented with palpable cervical lymph nodes after breast cancer (BC) surgery 2 years ago. Ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed thyroid nodules with irregular margins and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Biopsy was performed for the right largest cervical lymph node, and immunohistochemical analysis revealed negativity for thyroglobulin, estrogen receptor, and progestin receptor and positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. The diagnosis was TM from BC with cervical lymph node metastasis. Total thyroidectomy with bilateral central and lateral neck lymph node dissection was performed. After a 5-mo follow-up, no recurrence or novel distant metastasis was identified."
