  "text": "A 38-year-old female was admitted to hospital with complaints of abdominal pain and right upper quadrant mass for 10 days. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of abdomen revealed the dilated small intestine between the swelling ventral muscles in the right upper abdominal wall which suggested a ventral hernia. The surgeons considered it was a spontaneous hernia because there was no history of surgery or trauma in the upper abdomen. About two hours later, the patient underwent emergency surgery. According to laparotomy, a diagnosis of SH with ileum herniation in the right upper abdominal wall was confirmed. The necrotic ileum segment was resected. Meanwhile the abdominal wall defect was repaired by suturing the internal oblique and transverse muscles to the rectus sheath. The patient had a favorable outcome for 1 year without recurrence."
