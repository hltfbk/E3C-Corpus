  "text": "A 46-year-old female with Cogans's syndrome and a history of arterial hypertension presented with severe chest pain caused by an aneurysm of the ascending aorta with a dissection membrane located a few centimeters distal from the aortic root. After surgery, histopathological analysis revealed that vascular matrix integrity and expression of the major matrix molecules was characterized by elastolysis and collagenolysis and thus a dramatic loss of structural integrity. Remarkably, exceeding matrix deterioration was associated with massively increased levels of granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)."
