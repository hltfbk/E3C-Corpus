  "text": "A healthy 37-year-old British male presented to our clinic because his wife had conceived seven years after he had undergone a vasectomy. The result of his semen analysis after the vasectomy was negative, and the histopathological report confirmed that the sample contained tissue from both the left and right vas deferens. His wife conceived seven years after the procedure, and semen analysis at that time confirmed a total of 0.5 million sperm per milliliter of semen in a total semen sample of 6.3 ml. The total number of motile sperm recorded was 2.5 million."
