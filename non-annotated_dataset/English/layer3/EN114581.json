  "text": "We describe a case of 23-year-old male with mucocutaneous erosion and conjunctival injection and erosion who was found to have PNP. Pelvic hyaline-vascular CD was detected and completely excised. The mucocutaneous lesions improved postoperatively. Two years after pelvic surgery, the patient gradually developed conjunctival symblepharon in both eyes and pterygium in the right eye. The patient then underwent a successful exclusion of the symblepharon, an excision of the pterygium and an amniotic membrane transplantation in the right eye. However, after 6Â months, he experienced an aseptic corneal ulcer and recurrent pterygiumin the right eye. After treatment with systemic and local immunosuppressive medications, the corneal ulcer gradually healed and remained stable."
