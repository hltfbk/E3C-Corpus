  "text": "The authors describe a rare case of a pheochromocytoma which was first presented with cardiomyopathy in a 7-year-old patient. The patient was admitted with malaise, abdominal pain, polydipsia, and myalgia. Further evaluations revealed hyperglycemia, mild dehydration and sinus tachycardia but no HT. Echocardiography demonstrated some of the signs of cardiomyopathy which was incorrectly diagnosed as viral myocarditis. The patient was discharged with this diagnosis but he presented again with HT crisis a few months later. A diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was assigned after the evaluation of the HT secondary causes. The diagnosis was confirmed by metanephrine assay and the tumor was localized in the adrenal gland using the abdominal MRI."
