  "text": "A 54-year-old man with cutaneous plasmacytosis on the face, chest, and back complained of a history of atypical facial and lower leg pain and easy fatigability since the age of 45Â years. Muscle-strength tests revealed bilateral trivial gastrocnemius weakness with myalgia. The results of routine blood analysis, including creatine kinase and thyroid function, were normal, but levels of several inflammation markers and autoantibodies were elevated. Additionally, lower leg magnetic resonance imaging and gastrocnemius muscle biopsy revealed inflammatory myositis mimicking polymyositis. His plasmacytosis, myalgia, and lower leg weakness were ameliorated by prednisolone."
