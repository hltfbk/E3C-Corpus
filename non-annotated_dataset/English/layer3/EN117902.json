  "text": "We describe the cases of three patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and seronegative inflammatory arthritis who were treated with etanercept. They developed deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism one to three years after the initiation of etanercept therapy. All three patients had a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time with a positive lupus anticoagulant that persisted even after 12 weeks."
