  "text": "A 32 year old male patient came with a swelling in the middle third of the face to our private practice. The patient reported that the swelling was present since 1 year. Extraoral examination revealed that the swelling was soft inconsistency and had smooth surface and measured 1cm x1.5 cm in its greatest diameter. The swelling was freely movable and was not attached to the underlying tissue. The color of the skin was the same as that of adjacent. Intra-oral examination revealed nothing contributory. Aspiration revealed nothing. The lesion was surgically removed and submitted to the histopathologist. The microscopic examination revealed a cystic cavity lined by an atrophic epithelium. A prominent hyperorthokeratnised epithelium was seen. The granular layer was also quite noticeable and keratin was filled in the cystic lumen. No skin appendages were present in the cystic wall. The diagnosis was confirmed for epidermoid cyst. The patient was followed-up for 2 years and was asymptomatic."
