  "text": "A 30-year-old woman presented at 10Â weeks of gestation with hypertension, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury, consistent with thrombotic microangiopathy. She was managed initially with daily plasmapheresis. However, her kidney function did not recover, requiring hemodialysis. ADAMTS13 activity was later found to be within normal limit, hence diagnosis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome was strongly considered at that time and she was immediately treated with anti-C5 humanized monoclonal antibody (eculizumab). The patient responded well (resolution of thrombotic microangiopathy and recovery of renal function) to eculizumab, with continued remission after discharge and successfully delivered a healthy baby at term without any peripartum complications."
