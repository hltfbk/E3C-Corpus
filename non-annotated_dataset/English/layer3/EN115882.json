  "text": "This report refers to an Italian 69 year old woman with neurofibromatosis type 2 and a pancreatic gastrinoma. In the past she had encephalic meningiomas, a tongue schwannoma and bilateral acoustic neurinomas. She presented with weight loss and a long-term history of diarrhea, responsive to proton pump inhibitors. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed peptic ulcer of the duodenal bulb. Blood tests were normal, except for the elevation of plasma gastrin (1031 pg/ml; reference value <108) and chromogranin A (337 U/L; reference value <36). After secretin stimulation testing, the plasma gastrin level rose to 3789 pg/ml. The abdomen magnetic resonance imaging and gallium68-DOTATOC positron emission tomography scan demonstrated the presence of a 1.2 x 2 cm lesion in the pancreatic head and a liver metastatis. Pancreatic endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration revealed cytomorphologic features suggestive of pancreatic gastrinoma. Brain magnetic resonance showed a pituitary microadenoma. There was no evidence of hyperparathyroidism. The genetic test for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome mutation was negative."
