  "text": "We describe the case of a 54-year-old man diagnosed with HIV who developed severe rhabdomyolysis-induced anuric acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy following introduction of Genvoya® concomitantly with simvastatin, in the context of recently diagnosed hepatitis C and hepatitis A. Haemodialysis was continued over 5 weeks followed by progressive clinical and biological improvements. Five months later, a new antiretroviral regimen was started and has been well tolerated."
