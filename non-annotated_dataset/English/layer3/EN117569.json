  "text": "We describe a case of acute cholestatic hepatitis in a 68-year-old Caucasian man who was receiving olmesartan and hydrochlorothiazide for arterial hypertension. From the clinical and histologic findings, we diagnosed him as having hepatocellular-cholestatic injury and a disorder of glucose metabolism in the liver. To the best of our knowledge, no histopathologic description of hydrochlorothiazide hepatotoxicity has previously been documented in the literature."
