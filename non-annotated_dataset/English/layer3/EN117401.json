  "text": "A 40-year-old Indian man from West Bengal presented to our facility with a history of progressively severe left hip pain of insidious onset, requiring analgesics. Imaging with plain radiographs, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed findings of osteoid osteoma in a subarticular location in the femoral head, although imaging features were atypical due to the intra-articular subchondral location."
