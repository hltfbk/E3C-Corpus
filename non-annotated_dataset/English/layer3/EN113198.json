  "text": "Two cases of basal cell carcinoma of similar localisation are presented, where the carcinomas are removed using island flaps. In spite of the desire to observe the recommended field of surgical security (by the desire for the ultimate esthetic effect for the patient), one of the tumours was not completely removed, and as an alternative, reoperation was proposed using Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS)."
