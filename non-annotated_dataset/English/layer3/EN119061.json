  "text": "In this case report we describe a rare case of a fit and healthy 60-year-old man, with no previous history of abdominal surgery, who presented with signs and symptoms of small bowel obstruction as a result of an incarcerated transmesosigmoid hernia. The hernia was reduced and the incarcerated loop of small bowel was found to be viable. The patient made a good recovery and was discharged home on the fourth post-operative day."
