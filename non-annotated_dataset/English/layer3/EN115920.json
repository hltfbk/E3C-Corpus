  "text": "A 15-year-old Japanese boy was referred to us with fever of unknown origin. Whole body computed tomography demonstrated systemic lymphadenopathy, organomegaly and anasarca. Laboratory tests showed elevated C-reactive protein and hypoproteinemia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed a hyperplastic marrow with megakaryocytic hyperplasia and mild reticulin fibrosis. Despite methylprednisolone pulse therapy, the disease progressed markedly to respiratory distress, acute renal failure, anemia and thrombocytopenia. Serum and plasma levels of cytokines, including IL-6, vascular endothelial growth factor, neopterin and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors I and II, were markedly elevated. Repeated weekly TCZ administration dramatically improved the patient's symptoms and laboratory tests showed decreasing cytokine levels."
