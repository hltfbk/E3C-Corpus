  "text": "A 42-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain. Transvaginal ultrasonography showed mixed echogenic cystic masses in both ovaries. Her serum cancer antigen (CA19-9) level was elevated at 29,770â€‰U/ml. Surgical excision was performed. Histologic examination showed infiltrating nests of pleomorphic cells with prominent nucleoli and black pigments in the background of a mature cystic teratoma. These pleomorphic cells showed strong immunoreactivity for Melan-A and HMB-45. The patient was re-evaluated and the possibility of a melanoma at any other site was ruled out. Based on these findings, we concluded that the malignant melanoma originated from the ovarian mature cystic teratoma."
