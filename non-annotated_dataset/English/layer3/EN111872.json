  "text": "A 50-year-old male with a 5-year history of neck and shoulder pain had muscle atrophy and weakness in both arms. Physical examination revealed multiple tophi were seen in left wrist, both feet and knee; bilateral superficial sensory declined below level of mastoid portion and the muscle strengths of limbs decreased. Laboratory findings showed hyperuricemia and the C-reactive protein level was very high. Imaging studies including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed abnormality of the C5-6 intervertebral disc and irregular osteolytic destruction of both adjacent C5-6 endplates, narrowing of C5-6 disc space and swelling of prevertebral soft tissue. Under the circumstance of the lesions being not determined and nerve root symptoms, surgical treatment was performed and pathological examination of the specimen revealed deposited uric acid crystals surrounded by granulomatous inflammation. After surgery combined with pharmaceutical and rehabilitation treatment, the muscle strengths of limbs, the pain of neck and shoulder and the level of serum uric acid were all improved."
