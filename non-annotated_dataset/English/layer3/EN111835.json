  "text": "A 42-year-old man presented to our clinic with complaints of pain and limited movement in his left shoulder. The patient's complaints began after he experienced a fall 7 months ago. The patient was believed to have experienced posterior shoulder dislocation, and the clinical diagnosis was confirmed by radiological imaging. Computed tomography revealed a reverse Hill-Sachs lesion on the humeral head and on approximately 25% of the joint surface. During the McLaughlin procedure, because the osteoporotic humerus showed a collapse of approximately 30% on the posterior articular surface, an iatrogenic Hill-Sachs lesion was added to the reverse Hill-Sachs lesion at the beginning of the humeral head. The subscapularis tendon was transferred to the anterior defective area of the humeral head with three anchor sutures. Fixation was performed with a Kirschner wire, while the joint was in the reduction position. At the 62-month follow-up, constant shoulder score was calculated as 84. The patient was pleased with his results and was able to continue his routine activities."
