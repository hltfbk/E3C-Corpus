  "text": "We describe a 9-year-old boy who, at the beginning of the summer after the first swim in the sea, developed generalized urticaria, dyspnea, conjunctival hyperemia, blurred vision and loss of strength. The child was treated with intramuscular steroid and intravenous antihistamine, and the symptoms quickly resolved. Insect bite, contact with fish and drug ingestion were denied, and no unusual food had been eaten before the swim. A tentative diagnosis was made of either aquagenic urticaria or cold urticaria, but the specific tests were negative. Although the cause was unknown, prophylactic treatment with antihistamines was prescribed but in spite of this, wheals developed all over the body, after every swim in the sea. The child then came to our attention and relying on clinical history a diagnosis of atypical cold urticaria was made: development of hives even in areas not directly exposed to cold and a negative response to the cold stimulation test, are the characteristic features of this rare form of cold urticaria."
