  "text": "We report a case of 31-year-old man who developed a huge liver infarction. Persistent right upper abdominal pain and intermittent fever were the main symptoms in this patient. Computed tomography revealed a huge irregular lesion with a maximum diameter of 12.7 cm in the right lobe of the liver. Three-dimensional reconstruction was performed and no significant interruption of the main hepatic vessels was observed. The lesion was initially considered to be a malignant tumor with internal bleeding. Laparoscopic right hepatectomy was performed, and pathology indicated a rare liver infarction. The patient recovered well and was discharged on postoperative day 21. No fever or abnormal liver function were reported in the subsequent 6 mo."
