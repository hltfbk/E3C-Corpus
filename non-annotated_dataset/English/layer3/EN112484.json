  "text": "Two cases complained about abnormal vaginal bleeding and were diagnosed with intrauterine cystic adenomyosis by gynecological ultrasound and pathological examination. The clinical manifestations included dysmenorrhea, hypermenorrhea, and a history of cesarean section. Both cases underwent a surgery, and chocolate-like liquid was released from the cystic mass in the uterus and the manifestations were relieved."
