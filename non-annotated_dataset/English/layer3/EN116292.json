  "text": "A 40-year-old Caucasian man presented with a progressively growing, vegetating lesion localized in his right-hand external auditory canal. He had peripheral facial nerve paralysis and complete ipsilateral hearing loss. An incisional biopsy suggested extramammary Paget's disease, and the immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis. The tumor was considered inoperable because of the extensive skull base involvement, and he was referred for palliative radiotherapy."
