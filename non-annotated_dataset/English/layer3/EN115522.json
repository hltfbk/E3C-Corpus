  "text": "We report a rare case of bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation associated with coracoid processes fracture after a seizure episode, in a young lady of 29 years. This is a rare event, however as patient is often disoriented after seizures, frequently this can be missed diagnosis. So this article puts emphasis on possibilities of rare diagnosis, which if treated promptly can lead to early restoration of complete movement."
