  "text": "A 40-year-old man was referred for further examination of a mass over the right basal lung without specific symptoms. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a poorly-enhanced lesion in the right basal lung, abutting to the diaphragm, measuring 3.1 cm Ã— 1.5 cm in size. The mediastinum showed a clear appearance without evidence of abnormal mass or lymphadenopathy. A preoperative 3D image was reconstructed, which revealed a diaphragmatic lesion. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed, and a red papillary tumor was found, originating from the right diaphragm. The tumor was resected, and the pathological diagnosis was cavernous hemangioma."
