  "text": "A 7-month-old boy was admitted to our hospital for elective surgery to surgically correct a secundum type ASD. Unfortunately, a residual shunt 3.5 mm in diameter appeared before discharge and was enlarged at1-year follow-up. The cause of this residual shunt was dehiscence at the posteroinferior aspect, and the posteroinferior rim was 3.7 mm. After careful discussion and preparation, we proceeded with an interventional procedure. A 16 mm ASD occluder (AGA Medical Corp, Plymouth, Minnesota) was deployed successfully with no residual shunt. In some cases of ASD, interventional therapy is not considered due to the size and position of the defect, but we show here, a successful case of interventional therapy for a residual shunt with a deficient rim."
