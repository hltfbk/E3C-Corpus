  "text": "A 69-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our hospital's coronary care unit with progressive unstable angina five years following coronary artery bypass grafting and three years after percutaneous coronary intervention of the graft. Several attempts to engage the protruding part of the aorto-ostial stent in the graft failed. A catheter was eventually floated towards the protruding part using a wire to moor the catheter to the stent through the side-strut. The proximal part of the protruding stent was subsequently crushed with a new stent. Stent patency was observed 12 months after the procedure was performed."
