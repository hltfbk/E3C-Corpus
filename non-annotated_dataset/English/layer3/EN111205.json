  "text": "A 5-year-old Chinese boy presented with history of thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, and renal injury since the neonatal period. Gene analysis revealed two novel mutations in ADAMTS13: a missense mutation 332G > A (p:Gly111Glu) in exon4 and a nonsense mutation 3121C > T (p:Gln1041stop) in exon 24. Genetic analysis of his parents confirmed the heterozygous nature of the mutations."
