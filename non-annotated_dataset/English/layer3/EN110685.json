  "text": "A 67-year-old male presented to a rural facility complaining of weight-loss, fatigue, hematuria, dysuria, painful right inguinal ulceration, and right scrotal abscess drainage. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a distended appendix (> 1.3 cm) and a fistula between the appendix, urinary bladder, right scrotum, and right groin. Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed and diagnosed as MAA. After a right hemicolectomy, the MAA was staged as pT3b pN0 M0 G2."
