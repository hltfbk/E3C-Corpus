  "text": "The patient was a 9-month-old boy with low body weight due to intrauterine growth retardation. At 9 months after birth, he presented partial seizures. Computed tomography scanning revealed a mass (35 * 40 mm) in the left temporal lobe. Isointensity was noted on magnetic resonance T1-weighted images and fluid attenuation inversion recovery images. The tumor was heterogeneously enhanced with gadolinium. Positron emission tomography showed high methionine uptake in the tumor. During surgery, the tumor, which was elastic and soft and bled easily, was gross totally resected. A moderately clear boundary was noted between the tumor and normal brain parenchyma. Histologically, the tumor mainly comprised a ganglioglioma-like portion and short spindle cells at different densities. The former was immunohistochemically positive for some kinds of neuronal markers including synaptophysin. The spindle cells were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein, but desmoplasia was not observed."
