  "text": "A 24-year-old Nepali female presented with a 3-week history of low-grade fever, headache, and painful, discrete, unilateral left-sided cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. Among the multitude of tests that were carried out, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate was raised and there was thrombocytopenia while other tests were normal. Painful lymphadenopathy pointed to bacterial lymphadenitis while chronic low-grade fever suggested tuberculosis. A cervical lymph node was excised for histopathological examination to reach an accurate diagnosis. On the basis of pathognomonic features viz., paracortical foci composed of various types of histiocytes including crescentic type in the background of abundant apoptotic karyorrhectic debris, a diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease was made. On follow-up evaluation after 6 weeks, the patient had no systemic symptoms, enlarged lymph nodes had regressed in size significantly, and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate and platelet count had become normal."
