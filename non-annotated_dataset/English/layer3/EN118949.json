  "text": "We present a case of axillary artery pseudoaneurysm secondary to such a fracture, in a 82-year-old white woman, presenting 10 weeks after the initial injury, successfully treated with subclavian to brachial reversed vein bypass together with simultaneous open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture. We discuss the use of a Javidtrade mark shunt during combined upper limb revascularisation and open reduction and internal fixation of the fractured humerus."
