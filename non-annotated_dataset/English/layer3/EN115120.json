  "text": "The patient was 5 months old when he presented with a nephrotic syndrome. An exhaustive genetic testing was conducted and came back negative. A viral work-up only showed a positive cytomegalovirus PCR. Antiviral treatment lead to a complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome, with no requirement for steroid therapy. Renal function remained normal throughout follow-up."
