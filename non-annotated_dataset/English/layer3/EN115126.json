  "text": "The diagnosis and the treatment of two patients with Abernethy malformation by CT scan and Color Doppler Duplex Ultrasound is described. One patient was submitted to liver transplantation due to chronic liver disease and multiple nodules diagnosed as adenoma. The other patient had normal liver function and a mild neurological and psychomotor dysfunction, therefore we adopted clinical treatment and close liver parenchyma evaluation and nodule surveillance, using an imaging approach involving intercalating CT scan and Color Doppler Duplex Ultrasound every 6 months. We highlight some important direct and indirect findings of non-invasive imaging methods."
