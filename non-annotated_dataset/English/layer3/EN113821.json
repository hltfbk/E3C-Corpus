  "text": "We report the case of a 70-year-old white man who was treated for severe symptomatic aortic regurgitation using transcatheter aortic valve implantation from the apical approach. Because of recurrent cardiac decompensation 4 weeks after implantation he underwent the implantation of a left ventricular assist device system. A year later echocardiography showed a severe transvalvular central insufficiency. Our heart team decided to choose a valve-in-valve approach while reducing the flow rate of left ventricular assist device to minimum and pacing with a frequency of 140 beats/minute. There was an excellent result and our patient is doing well with no relevant insufficiency of the aortic valve at 12-month follow-up."
