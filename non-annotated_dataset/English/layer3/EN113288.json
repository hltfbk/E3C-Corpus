  "text": "A 27-year-old male presented with recurrent chordoma of the lumbar spine 4 years after initial diagnosis. Salvage therapies in the interval included repeat resections and radiation therapy. He ultimately developed multifocal recurrence not amenable to complete excision or reirradiation. A comprehensive genomic profiling assay was performed and revealed nondrugable alterations. Decision was made to proceed with systemic treatment with pazopanib 800 mg/day, resulting in tumor reduction (-23.1% reduction in size) and prolonged disease control."
