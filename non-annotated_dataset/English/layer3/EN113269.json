  "text": "The present case describes a 23-year-old male professional hockey player who suffered an isolated anterior dislocation of the proximal tibiofibular joint. Spontaneous reduction occurred several days following the injury; however, instability and subluxation continued and screw fixation was required. Ultimately the patient returned to competition at a professional level 3 months following the injury."
