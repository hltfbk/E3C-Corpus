  "text": "A 40-year-old man, with no medical history, presented pelvic pain for three months, associated with a rectal syndrome, rectal bleeding and subocclusive episodes which were resolved spontaneously. There was no concept of impaired general condition. Physical examination objectified a tough, budding rectal mass, with a smooth wall, localized 3cm above of anal margin. The chest examination showed a mass of 5cm which was tough, painful, situated next to the 6th left rib. A colonoscopy showed extrinsic compression of the rectum without evidence of a rectal tumour mass. A thoraco-abdominal computed tomography showed a large tissue mass taking the whole pelvis, with heterogeneous enhancement and presence of multiple necroses ranging of 17.3 x 14cm. It seemed to come from the right-side wall of the rectum. It is associated with liver and bone secondary locations. Biopsies of liver and bone metastasis confirmed the secondary locations of an intermediate risk GIST. Immunohistochemical study showed an overexpression of c-kit protein (CD117) and Dog1. Imatinib was prescribed in order to reduce the tumour size before proposing surgical resection. The abdominal CT scan, performed 3 months after starting treatment, showed a good response with regression of the rectal tumour and the liver metastasis and disappearance of the rib metastasis."
