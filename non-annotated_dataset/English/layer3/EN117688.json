  "text": "We present the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian female who developed a retroperitoneal abscess caused by H. parainfluenza after open cholecystectomy and common bile duct exploration. This presented nearly five weeks post-operatively. She underwent a second operation to drain the abscess, and was subsequently placed on appropriate antibiotics."
