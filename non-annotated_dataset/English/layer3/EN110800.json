  "text": "A nematode extracted from the right eye of a 69-year-old man referred with clinical symptoms including itching and redness was examined. After the morphometric analysis, Dirofilaria parasite was detected. Afterwards, a piece of worm body was cut and DNA was extracted and a 680-bp gene fragment amplification and nucleotide sequencing were performed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a D. immitis roundworm as the causative agent of infection. The patient was treated with antibiotics and corticosteroid and followed up for 1 month."
