  "text": "A 44-year-old female presented with left shoulder pain of 7-year duration. Magnetic resonance image displayed a 2.5 cm Ã— 2.5 cm lesion in the anterior glenohumeral joint, with hypointense T1- and hyperintense T2-weighted signal and peripheral and septal enhancement. Arthroscopic biopsy of the synovial-appearing mass led to a histologic diagnosis of synovial hemangioma. Successful embolization was performed, and repeat arthroscopy then revealed a white consolidated mass at the subscapularis recess. After en bloc excision, histologic evaluation was consistent with synovial chondromatosis. At 6 months, she denied any pain or limitation in her shoulder."
