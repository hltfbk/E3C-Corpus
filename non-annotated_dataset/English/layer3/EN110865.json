  "text": "A 55-year old male with a past medical history of human immunodeficiency virus, undetectable for 15 years and currently on elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, received 2 intra-articular injections of triamcinolone one month apart for a Baker's cyst in his right knee. He used nasal fluticasone for 9 days in-between the injections. After his second knee injection, he developed easy bruising and friable skin. Over the coming months, he experienced weight gain and Cushingoid facies. Four months after the knee injections he developed a pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis treated with warfarin. The Cushingoid facies prompted an evaluation and diagnosis of ICS along with hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis suppression."
