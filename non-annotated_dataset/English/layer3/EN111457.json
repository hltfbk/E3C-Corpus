  "text": "We report a 33-year-old male patient who was admitted to our department complaining of abdominal fullness for 20 days. A huge submucosal tumor at the esophagogastric junction was found by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. We successfully resected the lesion through endoscopic submucosal excavation without complications, which was pathologically confirmed to be a GIST. The patient was discharged 5 days after operation and has been doing well, and there was no recurrence 8 months after the operation."
