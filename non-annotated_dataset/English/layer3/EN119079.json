  "text": "A nine-year-old boy with Marfan syndrome and a 22 mm atrial septal defect (ASD) was treated successfully by interventional closure of his ASD by placing a 24 mm Amplatzer septal occluder. Follow up examinations showed a good result but an increasing enlargement of aortic root, so the patient was scheduled for operation. Intraoperative findings showed a perforation of the left atrial roof and the non-coronary sinus by penetration of the occluder device as well as penetration into the right atrial wall. The occluder was resected, the ASD was closed and the aortic sinus was reconstructed using a Dacron patch."
