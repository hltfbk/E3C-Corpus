  "text": "A 69-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed as having chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1b at the age of 55. She presented with hypertension, microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, renal dysfunction, purpura, and arthralgia at the age of 61. She also had hypocomplementemia and cryoglobulinemia. Renal biopsy revealed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and she was diagnosed as having HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic MPGN. She declined interferon therapy at the time and was treated with antihypertensive medications as well as oral corticosteroid that were effective in reducing proteinuria. However, when the corticosteroid dose was reduced, proteinuria worsened. She began antiviral treatment with daclatasvir/asunaprevir (DCV/ASV). Clearance of HCV-RNA was obtained by 2 weeks and sustained, and liver function was normalized. In addition, microhematuria turned negative, proteinuria decreased, hypocomplementemia and estimated glomerular filtration rate were improved, whereas cryoglobulinemia persisted. She completed 24 weeks of therapy without significant adverse effects."
