  "text": "A 16-year-old boy presented with complaints of headache, progressively diminishing vision and more recently generalized seizures. MRI revealed a large bifrontal meningioma which showed presence of a predominantly papillary pattern with areas of focal necrosis, frequent mitoses and bone invasion. He underwent radical excision of the tumor and is free from recurrence or metastasis at 15 months follow-up."
