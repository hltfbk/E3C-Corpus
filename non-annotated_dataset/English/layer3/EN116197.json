  "text": "A 69-year-old Asian man underwent a cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis. His cystic duct was not detected during surgery. An intraoperative cholangiography revealed that his common hepatic ducts drained directly into the neck of his gallbladder. There was no common bile duct, as evidenced by the union of the common hepatic and cystic ducts."
