  "text": "In case 1, an irregular hyperdense solid mass was localized in the left middle cranial fossa, demonstrating low and equal signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI; TR/TE 2,048.9 ms/26.1 ms), high signal intensity with multiple flow void effect on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI; TR/TE 4,000 ms/106.4 ms), and significant and homogeneous enhancement on post-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In case 2, the lesion in the right insular lobe showed a cystic-mural nodule pattern. The cystic content demonstrated similar density or signal intensity as cerebrospinal fluid, while the mural nodule demonstrated equal density or signal intensity on computed tomography (CT) and MRI. On post-contrast MRI, the mural nodule showed significant enhancement, but the cystic wall and content showed no enhancement. In case 3, a remarkably enhanced solid nodule was found in the cortex of the left parietal lobe with multiple small cysts surrounding it. This nodule showed low signal intensity on T2WI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI; TR/TE 6,000 ms/96.8 ms, b = 1,000 s/mm(2)). The preoperative diagnoses of the above three cases were meningioma, hemangioblastoma, and ganglioglioma. However, all were pathologically diagnosed as MA."
