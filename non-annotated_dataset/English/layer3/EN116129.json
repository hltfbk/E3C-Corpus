  "text": "We present the case of a 64-year-old Turkish man with a rapidly progressive perianal mass. Our patient had previously required medical treatment on multiple occasions for hemorrhoidal disease; however, the treatment was ineffective and gross lymph nodes were noted in his left inguinal region. Following excision of the mass and his lymph nodes, the pathological diagnosis of both tissues was mantle cell lymphoma."
