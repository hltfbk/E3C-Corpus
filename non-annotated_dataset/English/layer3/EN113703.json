  "text": "We report here two patients with clinical features of AS referred to our hospital for clinical follow-up and genetic diagnosis. Methylation Specific-Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MS-MLPA) of the 15q11.2-q13 region was carried out in our laboratory as the first diagnostic tool detecting two novel UBE3A intragenic deletions. Subsequently, the MLPA P336-A2 kit was used to confirm and determine the size of the UBE3A deletion in the two patients. A review of the clinical features of previously reported patients with whole UBE3A gene or partial intragenic deletions is presented here together with these two new patients."
