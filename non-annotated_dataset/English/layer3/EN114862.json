  "text": "We describe an infant with Prader-Willi syndrome who had severe, prolonged asymptomatic hyponatremia without a history of excessive fluid intake or desmopressin treatment. We compare the findings with those of the few other reported cases and describe, for the first time, results of a hypertonic saline infusion test and studies of adrenal cortical function."
