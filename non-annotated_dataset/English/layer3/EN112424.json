  "text": "Here, we presented a rare case of an occipital bone mass in a 3-year-old boy who was diagnosed with hemophilia A. The mass was misdiagnosed as an aneurysmal bone cyst by pathological examination. After resection, the patient underwent one-stage cranioplasty. However, the patient was admitted again for hematoma caused by an invasive procedure. A second surgery and one-stage cranioplasty were performed at the same time. A follow-up 3â€‰months after discharging showed the patient was uneventful, and the titanium mesh was well fixed."
