  "text": "A 12-year-old female presented to the clinic with a history of early-onset scoliosis, for which she underwent deformity correction surgery with spinal rectangle loop and sublaminar wires 4 years ago. At presentation, she had decompensated with increase in deformity and failed implant. She underwent revision deformity correction surgery with pedicle screws. 3D-printed patient-specific pedicle screw templates were useful in this patient for appropriate pedicle screw placement, as patient had obscured native anatomy due to fusion mass and in situ sublaminar wires."
