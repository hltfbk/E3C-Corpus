  "text": "A 71-year-old man presented with 'circular, green patches' in his central vision for 2 weeks. He had multiple relapsed stage IV BRAF gene mutant malignant melanoma. He was on treatment with Dabrafenib (Tafinlar) for 7 months and Trametinib (Mekinist) for 4 months respectively. The fundus looked normal. The OCT scan showed bilateral symmetrical cystoid macular edema, intraretinal and subretinal fluid, thickening of elliposoid zone and subretinal granular deposits. The symptoms resolved with temporary cessation of chemotherapy but OCT signs persisted."
