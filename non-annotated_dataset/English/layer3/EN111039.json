  "text": "A 29-year-old man presented with delusions of persecution and reference, auditory hallucinations, and negative symptoms, and was diagnosed with paranoid-hallucinatory schizophrenia. One and a half months after initiation of antipsychotic treatment with olanzapine, he developed compulsive sexual behavior and paraphilia, without signs of akathisia. After olanzapine discontinuation, a full remission of the hypersexual behavior was noted within one week, and treatment was switched to risperidone. Due to hyperprolactinemia, adjunct treatment with low-dose aripiprazole was initiated and a severe recurrence of identical hypersexual behavior occurred. The hypersexual behavior resolved completely within a week after aripiprazole discontinuation."
