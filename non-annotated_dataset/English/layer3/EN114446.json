  "text": "A 55-year-old woman with a history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and thalassemia trait presented with proteinuria (830 mg/day) in 2010. Initially, she was managed with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system blockade. In 2012, the proteinuria worsened (4.3 g/day) and a renal biopsy showed immunotactoid glomerulopathy. Despite extensive work up, no lymphoproliferative disorder was initially found. In January 2014, the patient presented with a soft-palate mass found on biopsy to be diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. She received 6 cycles of R-CHOP, 4 cycles of high dose methotrexate chemotherapy for CNS prophylaxis and 30 Gy of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. Follow-up revealed complete remission of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and resolution of proteinuria from the ITG."
