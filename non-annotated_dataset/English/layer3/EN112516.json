  "text": "We are presenting the results from multiple surgical esthetic and reconstructive surgical procedures performed on a female patient with severe congenital neurofibromatosis during 15 years (2000-2015). The external appearance of our patient was not reflected in the general public's beauty standards. Convinced that she was unusual and unaccepted by the society, she gathered all of the strength and became our patient at 15 years of age."
