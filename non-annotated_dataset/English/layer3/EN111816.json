  "text": "A 60 year -year-old patient presented with pain, stiffness, and decreased arc of movement at the right knee. The X-rays showed ossification of the joint capsule, ligaments, and quadriceps expansion. The spine had has calcification of the anterior longitudinal ligament and '\"wax drop' drop\" enthesophytes. Based on the complete skeletal survey, a diagnosis of DISH was made. During knee arthroplasty, it was difficult to correct the deformity with a measured resection technique. Additional resection of 4 mm was done both from the distal femur and proximal tibia to correct the deformity and achieve optimal kinematics. This unpliable nature of the soft tissues due to enthesitis ossification of periarticular tissues led to decrease flexion postoperatively."
