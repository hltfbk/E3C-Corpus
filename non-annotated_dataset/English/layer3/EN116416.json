  "text": "A 40-year-old man presented with left flank pain. The plain X-ray showed multiple coarse calcifications of 4.0x3.2 cm in diameter on the left upper quadrant abdomen. Computed tomography scan further revealed a solid renal mass and inside the mass there were calcifications. The size of the tumor was 5.6×5.5×6.3 cm. We performed a radical nephrectomy, and the histopathology showed a minimally fat-contained angiomyolipoma of multiple calcifications. The patient was free of recurrence or metastases after a follow-up period of 3 years."
