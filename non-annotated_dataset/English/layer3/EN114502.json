  "text": "We present a case of intrahepatic PEComa that showed a strong regional correlation with the presence of heterotopic pancreas. An intrahepatic tumor and biliary dilatation was incidentally discovered during a diagnostic evaluation to investigate low-back pain in a 47-year-old Japanese male. Cholangiocarcinoma was suspected and a left hemihepatectomy performed. Histological examination revealed a 3 × 3.8-mm tumor in the neighboring B2 bile duct. Histological and immunohistochemical investigations revealed the presence of a PEComa and pancreatic acini within the tumor mass. PEComa in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic regions are extremely rare. The presence of heterotopic pancreas is also relatively uncommon."
