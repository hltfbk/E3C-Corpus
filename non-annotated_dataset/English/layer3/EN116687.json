  "text": "We present the case of a 33-year-old Hispanic man with local invasive retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma and right kidney exclusion along with femoral venous thrombosis, who was admitted for tumor resection. He had been receiving multiple nephrotoxic antibiotics for a long time (including tigecycline and colistimethate sodium) and had a persistent urinary infection related to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (with susceptibility to colistimethate). Colistimethate was administered through a three-lumen urinary device for continuous urinary irrigation over seven days. Our patient did not refer to any adverse effects. A urine culture control taken at the end of the irrigation and another taken 10 days later were negative."
