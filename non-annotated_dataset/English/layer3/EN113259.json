  "text": "A 48-year-old woman presenting with a 1-year history of dysphagia was noted to have a homogeneous irregular mass measuring 70 mm in diameter and arising from the submucosal layer of the distal esophagus. A diagnosis of an esophageal submucosal tumor (SMT) was made, most likely leiomyoma. Robot-assisted thoracoscopic excision of the tumor was performed. The da Vinci Surgical System provided delicate dissection in the confined posterior mediastinal space, and the large dumbbell-shaped tumor was completely removed without damage to the mucosal integrity. The operative time was 108 min, and the blood loss was less than 20 ml. The pathology of the tumor was esophageal schwannoma. The patient experienced an unremarkable recovery and was discharged on the fifth day after operation. No symptoms or recurrence were present at the 50-month follow-up postoperatively."
