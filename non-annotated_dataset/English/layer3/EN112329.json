  "text": "A 25-years-old male patient presented complaining of left middle finger swelling which was painless and progressive in size with no restriction of range of motion. Plain X-ray films of the left hand showed a heterogeneous lobulated soft tissue mass on the volar aspect of the middle finger which was confirmed by MRI scan. Surgery was performed by doing a left middle finger soft tissue excision and diagnosis of Macrodystrophia lipomatosa was confirmed by the histopathology report. Patient was on regular follow up in the clinic with no tumour recurrence and an excellent cosmetic as well as functional result with full finger joints range of motion."
