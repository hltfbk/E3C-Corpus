  "text": "An 18-year-old female patient referred to us with complaints of dyspnea (NYHA score of 2-3). Physical examination revealed an apical rumble and a harsh second heart sound. Echocardiographic examination revealed a large mid-trabecular ventricular septal defect with bidirectional shunt and the widest diameter measuring 22 mm on 2D echocardiography. Left and right heart cavities were enlarged. Before and after the vasoreactivity test performed during cardiac catheterization, average aortic pressure was 65 → 86 mmHg, average pulmonary artery pressure: 58 → 73 mmHg, Qp/Qs: 1.6 → 3.2, PVR: 4.6 → 4.3 Wood/U/m2 and PVR/SVR: 0.5 → 0.2. On left-ventricular angiocardiogram, the largest end-diastolic defect diameter was 21 mm. The closure procedure was performed with transthoracic echocardiographic guidance, using a 24 mm Cera septal occluder and a 14 F sheath dilator to make a 4.5-5 mm opening. Measured immediately after the procedure and during cardiac catheterization one month later, average aortic pressure was 75 → 75 mmHg, average pulmonary artery pressure: 66 → 30 mmHg, Qp/Qs 1.5 → 1.4, PVR: 4.4 → 2.9 Wood/U/m2 and PVR/SVR: 0.4 → 0.2. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination performed 24 hours after the procedure showed a max 35-40 mmHg gradient between the left and right ventricles through the fenestration. After the procedure, we observed sporadic early ventricular systoles and a nodal rhythm disorder that started after approximately 12 hours and spontaneously reverted to normal 9 days later."
