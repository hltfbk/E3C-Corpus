  "text": "A 20-year-old patient who had a history of recent anterior knee surgery at another institution presented with allodynia, dysesthesia, and a positive Tinel's test over the surgical scar. The pain was exacerbated by light touch, was progressively worse, and was limiting sports participation and activities of daily living. A clinical diagnosis of neuroma of the IBSN was made and this was successfully treated by microsurgical neurolysis, resection of the neuroma, and burying of the stump. This resulted in complete resolution of pain."
