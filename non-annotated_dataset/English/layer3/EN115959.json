  "text": "We describe the testicular histopathology of a 17-year-old XY subject with 5α-R2 deficiency caused by the recurrent homozygous Gly115Asp loss of function mutation of the SRD5A2 gene.We also performed an immunohistochemical analysis in order to further study the relationship between seminiferous tubules structure, Sertoli cell differentiation and androgenic signaling impairment in this case. We thus evaluated the testicular expression of the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), androgen receptor (AR) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD). Histological analysis revealed a heterogeneous aspect with a majority (92%) of seminiferous tubules (ST) presenting a mature aspect but containing only Sertoli cells and devoid of germ cells and spermatogenesis. Focal areas of immature ST (8%) were also found. Testicular AR and 3βHSD expression were detected in adult male control, 5α-R2 deficiency and CAIS subjects. However, AMH expression was heterogeneous (detectable only in few AR negative prepubertal ST, but otherwise repressed) in the 5α-R2 deficiency, conversely to normal adult testis in which AMH was uniformly repressed and to an adult CAIS testis in which AMH was uniformly and strongly expressed."
