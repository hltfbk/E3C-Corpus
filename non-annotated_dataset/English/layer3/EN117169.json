  "text": "A 13-year-old Moroccan boy was admitted with obstructive jaundice to the children's Hospital of Rabat, Department of Pediatric Oncology. Laboratory study results showed a high level of total and conjugated bilirubin. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed a dilatation of the intra-hepatic and extra-hepatic bile ducts with a tissular heterogeneous tumor of the head of the pancreas and five hepatic lesions. Biopsy of a liver lesion was performed, and a histopathological examination of the sample confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Our patient underwent a palliative biliary derivation. After that, chemotherapy was administered (5-fluorouracil and epirubicin), however no significant response to treatment was noted and our patient died six months after diagnosis."
