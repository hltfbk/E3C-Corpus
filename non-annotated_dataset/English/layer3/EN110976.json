  "text": "We present here a case with traumatic cataract and corneal opacity after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). The patient was successfully treated using FLACS, capsular tension ring and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Posterior capsule rupture and vitreous loss were noted during the operation. However, the intraocular lens was successfully captured because of a complete capsulorhexis performed by FLACS."
