  "text": "Case-1, a 14-months-old female presented with recurrent respiratory distress, failure to thrive and hepatosplenomegaly. Lung biopsy was suggestive of alveolar proteinosis and liver biopsy confirmed foamy macrophages. Molecular analysis revealed homozygous mutation c.141C > A in exon 2 of NPC2 gene. Case-2, a 3-year-old male presented with dyspnoea and hepatomegaly noticed at 1 year of age. HRCT-scan of thoracic region showed consolidation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Broncho-alveolar lavage revealed moderate amount of foamy macrophages and bone marrow examination detected foam cells. Homozygous T > C transition in intron 1 of the NPC2 gene was identified."
