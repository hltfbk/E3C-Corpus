  "text": "We report the case of a 25-year-old female with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus who initially presented with symptoms of sinusitis but rapidly progressed with signs of left-sided facial necrosis due to occlusion of the left internal maxillary artery. Early surgical debridement did not yield a microbiological diagnosis. Deeper surgical debridements ultimately revealed angioinvasive fungal disease consistent with mucormycosis. The patient recovered after repeated surgical intervention and aggressive parenteral antifungal therapy."
