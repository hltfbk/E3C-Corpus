  "text": "A 33-year-old Asian female who underwent penetrating keratoplasty in both eyes developed corneal melting in the right eye and marginal keratitis in the left eye in her fifth month of pregnancy. Marginal keratitis in the left eye immediately subsided with topical steroid therapy. However, spontaneous corneal melting progressed in the right eye, despite oral steroid therapy and amniotic membrane transplantation. We performed tectonic penetrating keratoplasty and corneoscleral grafting in the right eye."
