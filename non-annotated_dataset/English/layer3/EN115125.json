  "text": "A 17-year-old male adolescent of Middle-East origin presented with delusions and hallucinations after extensive cannabis smoking. His first psychotic episode, with paranoid delusions and hallucinations, progressed into severe catatonic symptoms. His symptoms were treated with electroconvulsive therapy and risperidone and he was transferred to a residential substance abuse treatment center. He remained drug-free and non-psychotic for 3.5 years. Given the temporal association with extensive cannabis use, and his full remission of symptoms lasting several years, a cannabis-induced psychosis-though atypically extended-could be suspected. However, after 3.5 years without psychiatric care, and in a drug-free state, our patient again presented with positive psychotic symptoms, possibly induced by a period of severe psychosocial stress."
