  "text": "We report a case of renal malakoplakia in a 55-year-old Iranian man with a past history of recurrent urinary tract infections who presented with left flank pain. An ultrasound study showed a large solid left renal mass, and he underwent a left radical nephrectomy with a clinical diagnosis of a renal tumor. Pathology slides revealed the diffuse infiltration of sheets of Periodic Acid Schiff-positive histiocytes in his renal parenchyma; these cells showed strong immunoreactivity for CD 68. The final diagnosis was renal malakoplakia."
