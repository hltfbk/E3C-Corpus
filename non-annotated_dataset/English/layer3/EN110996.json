  "text": "A 47-year-old man with a Model End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 11 underwent LDLT for HCC within the Milan criteria for liver cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B virus infection, with his 48-year-old elder brother as the living donor. One year and 10 months after liver transplantation, he visited a nearby hospital with a chief complaint of discomfort on swallowing. A pedunculated polyp was found in the hypopharynx, and biopsy revealed HCC metastasis. We performed pharyngeal polypectomy. Two years later, cervical lymph node metastasis appeared, and neck lymph node dissection was performed. Although recurrence subsequently occurred three times in the grafted liver, the patient is still alive 12 years and 10 months after recurrence of pharyngeal metastasis. He is now a tumor-free outpatient taking sorafenib."
