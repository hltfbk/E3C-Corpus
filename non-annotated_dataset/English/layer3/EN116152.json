  "text": "Our patient was a 31-year-old Yemenite man with no significant past medical history, who presented with progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and limited functional capacity over the last few years. A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed severe mitral stenosis, which was treated with a mitral valve valvuloplasty. The procedure was complicated by significant mediastinal bleeding that did not respond to routine maneuvers, which included pericardiocentesis and correction of coagulopathy. Our patient was evaluated for surgical intervention but responded to treatment with activated factor VII."
