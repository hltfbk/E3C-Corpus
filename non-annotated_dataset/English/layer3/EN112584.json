  "text": "We present a rare case of a paraglenoid cyst resulting in a ductal syndrome by suprascapular nerve compression. A 56-year-old man consulted our department for chronic pain of the left shoulder with a decrease in muscle strength. On clinical examination, the patient had a deficit of external rotation with a clear amyotrophy of the infraspinatus fossa. We opted for arthroscopic surgical resection. At the last follow-up, the patient did not show any more pain, with a total recovery of muscle strength."
