  "text": "A 36-year-old Hindu, Indian male patient presented with bony pain, kyphosis, dragging sensation in the abdomen, dementia and ptosis of the left eyelid for one year. Clinical examination and history pointed to be a lipid storage disease. Radiological examination showed bilateral necrosis of the neck of femur. A final diagnosis of G.D. type-3 with bilateral necrosis of the femur neck was reported after examining the bone marrow smears. Unfortunately, we were unable to do the enzyme study as the patient was lost in the follow-up."
