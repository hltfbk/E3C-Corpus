  "text": "A 63-year-old man with actinic keratoses on his arms developed a facial seborrheic dermatitis-like reaction after topically applying 5-fluorouracil 5% cream twice daily to actinic keratoses on his forearms for 7Â days. The facial dermatosis resolved shortly after discontinuation of the 5-fluorouracil; upon rechallenge of topical 5-fluorouracil on his arms, the facial seborrheic dermatitis recurred."
