  "text": "A 32-year-old man presented with a history of noticing a swelling in his right testicle for a period of 1 month which had become painful over the 10 days before presentation. Pre-operative imaging failed to shed light on the nature of the lesions (malignant or benign). The diagnostic dilemma was explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained for an orchiectomy. The patient underwent a high inguinal orchiectomy. The histopathology revealed a filarial granuloma of the testicular tunic."
