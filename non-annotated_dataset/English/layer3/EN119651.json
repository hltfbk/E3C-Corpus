  "text": "A 12-year-old boy with history of BB gun injury to his right eye was referred for loss of vision. His visual acuity was counting fingers at one meter in the right eye and with 3+ relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD). On slit lamp examination, the right eye appeared normal except for 1+ vitreous reaction. Fundus examination of the right eye revealed a pale disc with superior retinal scar and diffuse submacular fibrosis compatible with chorioretinitis sclopetaria. Orbital CT-scans showed transection of the optic nerve by the BB gun pellet, which was lodged at the orbital apex."
