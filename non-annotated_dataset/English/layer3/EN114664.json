  "text": "A 13-year-old boy, a case of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with neck pain, and bilateral upper limb radiculopathy for 2 months with affected daily living, with intact neurology. Imaging demonstrated 46Â° kyphosis (C3-C5), marked dystrophic changes of the C4 and C5, extreme dorsal angulation indenting the cord. Anterior surgery was planned for the patient with neuromonitoring. Through left anterior approach, total C3, C4 and C5 corpectomy was accomplished, keeping the PLL intact. The defect was filled with a fibular cortical graft which was stabilized with 48 mm cervical screw plate, showing full correction of kyphosis postoperatively. At the follow-up 6 months postoperatively, lateral plain radiograph showed stability of the cervical spine fusion without correction loss. The patient had full relief from tingling and numbness with no neurological deficit and could resume his daily duties. Patient is asymptomatic at 2 years follow up."
