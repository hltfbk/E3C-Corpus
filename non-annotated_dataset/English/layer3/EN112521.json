  "text": "In a trapezius-shaped, osteotomy was performed in the chin region. The mobilized segment was advanced, and the existing gap was grafted using interpositional allograft materials. Each side had been fixated by three-hole plates and two screws. The outcomes revealed no change in lower anterior teeth vitality. The patients did not report any changes of sensation in lower lip and chin either. The measurements indicated no increase in depth of mentolabial fold in patients undergoing this surgical technique. The postoperative evaluation showed a successful esthetic outcome for the patient and the surgeon concurrently."
