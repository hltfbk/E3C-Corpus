  "text": "A 68-year-old woman with abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant was referred to our hospital. Abdominal ultrasonography in the emergency ward revealed acute cholecystitis and dilated CBD. Laboratory findings showed elevated levels of transaminases, phosphatase, and Î³-glutamyltranspeptidase. Pharmaceutical treatment for 3 d did not relieve the symptoms. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and computed tomography (CT) showed proximal bile duct dilatation but could not identify the cause. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) demonstrated a mixed echogenic mass in the distal CBD. During surgery, a firm mass was found in the distal CBD and the Whipple procedure was performed with the initial concern of malignancy. Histology showed diffuse adenomyomatous hyperplasia."
