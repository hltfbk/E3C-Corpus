  "text": "This is a case of a 14-year-old male who sustained a twisting injury to his right leg after a fall from a height. He sustained a minimally displaced spiral fracture of the mid-shaft of his right tibia with a concomitant ipsilateral two part triplane fracture of the ankle. He underwent minimally invasive percutaneous locking plate fixation for tibial fracture and percutaneous screw fixation for an ankle fracture. Both fractures healed uneventfully in 10 weeks with complete functional recovery in 12 weeks."
