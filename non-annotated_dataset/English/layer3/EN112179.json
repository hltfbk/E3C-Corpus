  "text": "A 71-year-old man was admitted to our clinic with abdominal pain. Computed tomography showed a cholangiocarcinoma located at the caudate lobe that involved the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the roots of the three major hepatic veins. Portal vein embolization of the left and right anterior portal veins was performed. As the IRHV was present but thin, RHV was also embolized. Left hepatic trisectionectomy with resection of the involved IVC and RHV, preserving the IRHV, was done. The IVC was reconstructed with artificial graft. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 36."
