At 32 weeks and 4 days classical cesarean section was done with placenta left in situ. Prophylactic bilateral internal iliac artery balloon was inserted. Post cesarean section, uterine artery embolization was performed. Post-operative: Clinical features of pulmonary embolism (PE) developed about 4 hours later. Post-Operative Day 13: Total abdominal hysterectomy was done. After few days of discharge, the patient presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath.
