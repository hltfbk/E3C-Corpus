  "text": "A 17-year-old boy with lower abdominal pain was diagnosed with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or a hematoma at a local hospital. He had no history of FAP, trauma, or previous surgery. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed for observational purposes three times over a 9-month period. The tumor gradually decreased in size over time; however, the tumor did not shrink sufficiently to be diagnosed as a hematoma. Because there was a high possibility of a GIST from the stomach, he underwent laparotomy. Operative findings revealed that the tumor was a hard mass firmly attached to both the greater curvature of the stomach and the inferior pole of the spleen. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as a desmoid tumor derived from the stomach."
