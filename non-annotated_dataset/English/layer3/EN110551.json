  "text": "A 28-year-old woman presented with a 2-day history of sudden voice modification.\nShe had no relevant medical past. She did not complain of nasal reflux. The rest of the systematic anamnesis was contributory for an episode of rhinitis that resolved spontaneously five days before symptoms' onset.\nPhysical examination revealed bilateral velar paralysis with open rhinolalia during phonation. No skin rash or other neurological focal signs were present. The gag reflex was preserved, and pharyngo-laryngeal and lingual mobility were normal. The exploration of the remaining cranial nerves was normal. Endoscopic examination of the pharynx revealed no masses and the rest of examination was normal.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and upper cervical region demonstrated was normal, especially the intracranial portion of cranial nerves IX and X. Serologies were obtained for cytomegalovirus, herpes virus 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, hepatitis A virus, parvovirus B19 and Coxsackie A9i. They were negative.\nThe patient followed a speech therapy. She didn't receive any medical treatment. Full recovery was seen at 3 weeks follow-up."
