  "text": "We report a case of circumscribed choroidal hemangioma (CCH) in a 59-year-old man refractory to laser treatment. Visual acuity was 20/200 and a serous macular detachment was present. The CCH was treated with oral propanolol, whereupon visual acuity improved to 20/20 and the macular detachment resolved without systemic or local adverse effects."
