  "text": "A 24-year-old patient who delivered vaginally at 40(+4) weeks gestation. The placenta was retained despite the use of oxytocics and attempts of manual removal. Conservative management including uterine arteria embolism, hysteroscopic resection and mifepristone was used but failed and finally the patient died from acute trophoblastic PE and allergic shock when infusing povidone-iodine into her uterine cavity."
