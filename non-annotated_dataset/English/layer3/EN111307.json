  "text": "A 16-year-old woman with SPT of the pancreas developed liver metastases 5.3 years after complete resection of the primary pancreatic tumor. She was admitted with chief complaints of abdominal pain in the upper abdomen and a weight loss of approximately 5 kg over 4 mo. Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA 199 were normal. An abdominal computed tomography scan found multiple nodules in the right lobe of the liver that measured approximately 13.5 cm × 10.8 cm × 21.4 cm. Immunohistochemical staining results showed that CD10 and CD56 were positive, and the patient was diagnosed with SPT of the pancreas with liver metastasis. The patient underwent percutaneous cryoablation and interventional embolization. During the 5-year follow-up, the patient remained disease-free after cryoablation, with relatively normal immune function."
