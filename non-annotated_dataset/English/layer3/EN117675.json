  "text": "We report a rare case of cystadenofibroma of the fallopian tube in a 19-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with sudden onset of right iliac fossa pain. A clinical diagnosis of appendicitis was made and she was taken to the operating theater for an appendicectomy. Intraoperatively, the appendix appeared normal. However, the 8 cm cyst contained within the right ovary and the blood in the pelvis warranted a salpingo-oopherectomy. Our patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged after four days. Histology revealed a benign cystadenofibroma of the fallopian tube. There was no evidence of recurrence in the follow-up period of 12 months."
