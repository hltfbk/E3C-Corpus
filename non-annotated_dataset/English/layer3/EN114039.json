  "text": "A 70-year-old man undergoing treatment for stable alcoholic liver disease presented to the emergency with gradually progressive diffuse abdominal pain associated with vomiting and constipation for 7 days. He had gaseous abdominal distention but was not obstipated. He had a history of 2 laparotomies in the past for small bowel obstruction secondary to enterolith impaction. He was initially managed conservatively but since there was no significant clinical improvement, he underwent an exploratory laparotomy. A recurrent enterolith 5 × 5 cm in size was found impacted in the mid ileum with multiple dense serosal adhesions and bands. Adhesiolysis and enterotomy with removal of enterolith were performed."
