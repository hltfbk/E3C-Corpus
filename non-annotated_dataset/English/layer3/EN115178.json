On examination, he was rational, hypotensive, tacycardic, tacypneic and he did not have clinical evidence of fluid leakage or pneumonitis. His serology showed high titre of dengue IgG and IgM and rising titre of leptospirosis antibody. His course of illness was complicated with septic shock, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation and he succumbed to his illness on the eighth day of admission."
