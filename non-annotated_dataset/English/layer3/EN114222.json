  "text": "In April 2014, a 90-year-old female presented with left thigh pain after a fall from standing height. She had a previous fixation of a left intertrochanteric hip fracture with a sliding hip screw in 1999 and a 9-year history of bisphosphonate therapy. Radiographs obtained in the emergency department revealed a left-sided femoral shaft fracture at the distal aspect of the previously applied five-hole side plate. Of note, the periprosthetic fracture demonstrated cortical thickening at the fracture site of the lateral femoral cortex, lack of comminution as well as a transverse appearance. The patient was taken to the operating room the next day for retrograde placement of an intramedullary nail of the left femur with revision of left intertrochanteric femur fracture fixation. By 3 months postoperatively, she had obtained full radiographic union."
