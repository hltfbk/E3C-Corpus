  "text": "A 44-year-old Asian female with symptomatic myasthenia gravis was referred for thymectomy. Originally thought to have Bell's Palsy, her symptoms began with right eyelid drooping and facial weakness. Over time, she developed difficulty holding her head up, upper extremity weakness, difficulty chewing and dysarthria. These symptoms worsened with activity. She was found to have positive acetylcholine receptor binding antibody on her myasthenia gravis panel. A preoperative CT scan demonstrated a 3.5 cm × 2 cm anterior mediastinal mass along the right heart border and phrenic nerve. A complete thymectomy, via right-sided robotic-assisted approach was performed en bloc with a portion of the right phrenic nerve and a 4 cm × 4 cm portion of pericardium overlying the right atrium and superior right ventricle. Upon undocking of the robot and closure of the port sites, the patient became acutely hypotensive (lowest recorded blood pressure 43/31 mmHg). The camera was reinserted and demonstrated partial cardiac herniation through the anterior pericardial defect toward the right chest. An emergent midline sternotomy was performed and the heart was manually reduced. The patient's hemodynamics stabilized. A vented Gore-Tex 6 cm × 6 cm patch was sewn along the pericardial edges with interrupted 4-0 prolene to close the pericardial defect."
