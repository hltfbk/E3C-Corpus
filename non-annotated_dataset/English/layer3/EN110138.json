  "text": "It concerns a 47 years male who was admitted at Bamenda Military Hospital. In the past history, he declared smoking (about 10 packet-years) and alcohol consumption; but he has always been well in the exception of occasional fatigue attributed to hard work. Two months previous the hospitalization, he felt pains on the right ankle; the joint also showed edema which extended upward to the knee. For the patient and his family, these manifestations were due to witchcraft; he was then treated by a traditional practitioner. As the situation worsened, with pains and edema progressing, he was forced to consult in our service.\nAt presentation, general signs showed a temperature of 38°4 C, weight 67 kg (BMI 23.4 kg/m2), pulse 102, and respiratory rate 18. He was unable to walk; presenting a warm shining, painful, discolored and swollen right calf and leg. A gangrenous area was formed on the foreleg. The pain was more severe on pressure over the dilated and hardened popliteal and femoral vessels. Peripheral pulses were non-palpable. There was no history of trauma. This presentation was very suggestive of phlegmasia cerulea dolens. Investigations -ESR 120 mm/first hour; CRP 48 mg/L; blood urea 0.65 g/L; creatininemia 17 mg/L; HIV positive; CD4 count 209 cells/µL; syphilis and chlamydia serologies negatives; aspartate amino-transferase 45 UI/L; alamine amino-transferase 37 UI/L; Gamma-glutamyl transferase 49 UI/L; alkaline phosphatase 65 UI/L; albuminemia 35 g/L; TP 89%; INR 1.2; Urine stick normal; fasting blood sugar 1.65 g/L.\n-EKG: sinusal tachycardia (105/bpm).\nChest X-ray: normal heart shadow; clear lung parenchyma.\n-Lower limb ultrasound: complete thrombosis in the right limb, extended from the tibial veins, popliteal and to the femoral veins; and very weak pulse in the arteries.\n-Abdominal echography: normal sized kidneys with bilateral increase in echogenicity (exceeding liver parenchymal) and a maintained cortico-medullary differentiation.\nThe retained diagnosis was phlegmasia cerulea dolens. The patient received intravenous fluids, subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin and oral anticoagulant with monitoring of INR. His right leg kept elevated. Treatment also included mixt short and long acting insulin, antibiotics, antiretroviral drugs (HAART), sub-cutaneous morphine. If fever ceased, swelling and discoloration progressed upward to mid-thigh. The patient was transferred to a vascular surgery center where an amputation was made."
