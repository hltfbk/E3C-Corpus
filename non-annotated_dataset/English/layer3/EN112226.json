  "text": "A 19-year-old patient presented with complaints of dyspnea and fever, myalgia and generalized tiredness. Examinations found him to suffer pancytopenia and esophageal candidiasis caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. This deficiency can be associated to inadequate intake and the diet of the patient as a vegetarian. Parenteral B12 treatment led the patient to symptomatically improve."
