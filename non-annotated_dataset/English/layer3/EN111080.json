  "text": "A 67-year-old man was admitted to our university hospital with dyspnea. Progressive respiratory failure developed leading to admission to the intensive care unit, intubation and prone positioning was necessary. To ensure adequate oxygenation and lung protective ventilation veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was established. Despite maximal therapy and adequate antiinfective therapy of all discovered pathogens the condition of the patient declined further and he deceased. Postmortem autopsy revealed Mucor and Aspergillus mycelium in multiple organs such as lung, heart and pancreas as the underlying cause of his deterioration and death."
