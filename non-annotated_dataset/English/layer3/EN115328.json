  "text": "In this work, we report for the first time an excellent clinical response to vemurafenib in a Norwegian patient with debilitating progressive spastic paraparesis due to intra-axial infiltration of the thoracic spinal cord. The patient had been unresponsive to interferon-alpha. Low dose vemurafenib (720 mg daily) for a period of three months resulted in significant tumor shrinkage by >60% and regression of contrast enhancement and fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron-emission tomography. The patient's spastic paraparesis and gait function improved dramatically. She currently walks unaided and reports a substantially improved quality of life."
