  "text": "Sixty-seven year-old male patient with IPF was admitted to hospital due to acute onset hemoptysis. In addition to a definite usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, a chest CT scan showed a non-enhancing nodular opacity in the right upper lobe and an enhancing nodule in the right lower lobe. Bronchoscopic biopsy of the nodule in the right lower lobe revealed squamous lung cancer. After 2 cycles of chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin, the tumor in the right lower lobe was no longer detectable after 2â€‰years of follow-up; however, the nodule in the right upper lobe had increased significantly. Finally, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was cultured from the bronchoalveolar (BAL) sample submitted at the last evaluation, and the patient was confirmed to have active pulmonary TB."
