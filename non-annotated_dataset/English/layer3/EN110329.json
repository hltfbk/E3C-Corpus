  "text": "We report the 9-month-old exclusively breast-fed girl who had been referred due to progressive hyptonia and apathy. Pregnancy and birth history were unremarkable. The girl had been born full-term (39 weeks) with a birth weight (40 th percentile), length (70 th percentile) and head circumference (80 th percentile) within the normal range. After normal development within the first 4 months, she had lost developmental milestones, activity had generally decreased, and she had progressively feeding difficulties. The girl was pale and tachycardic at presentation, motor skills and cognitive development of infants were delayed. There were no organomegaly and dysmorphic features. Neurological examination revealed apathy and profound hypotonia with brisk deep tendon reflexes. She had head control, however, axial and peripheral tonus had slightly weakened. Infants was exclusively breast-fed and received no vitamin supplementation. Blood count pronounced: hemoglobin (Hb) level at 9.2 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume (MCV), 114 fL; leukocyte count, 5300 cells/mm 3 ; platelet count, 412 109 cells/mm 3 ; blood chemistry and endocrine analysis were unremarkable including levels of lactate, pyruvate, ammonia, thyroidal parameters, prolactin and ACTH. Parvovirus B19, Hepatitis C and B, EBV and CMV infections were excluded. Because of macrocytic anemia and bicytop√©nia, bone marrow aspiration was realised and revealed dysplastic features consistent with reactive myelodysplasia. Serum folic acid level was normal while vitamin B12 level was less than 83pg/mL (normal range, 200-400); and serum homocystein level very high at 47,22UM/L (4.6-8.1). The brain CT revealed cerebral atrophy and delayed myelination. This metabolic analysis documented significantly diminished vitamin B12 serum levels as well as methylmalonic aciduria, low methionine and markedly elevated homocysteine serum levels indicating vitamin B12 deficiency. Following erythrocyte transfusion, supplementation of vitamin B12 was initiated days after admission, starting with intramuscular injections everyday 1mg for 1 week, then 1mg every week for 4 weeks, and then 1000 mg every month for 6 months. A follow-up 6 weeks after admission revealed normal serum vitamin B12 levels, normal urinary excretion of methylmalonic acid and hematologic parameters were normalized. Regarding neurocognitive development, the girl had achieved appropriate head control and was able to sit with slight assistance. Investigations on the mother of patient showed complete deficiency of vitamin B12 (< 30 pg/ml) without macrocytic anemia, anti-parietal cell antibodies (APCA), Anti-intrinsic factor were not found. This mothers was on strict vegetarian diet (excluded all animal products from her diet) belong to a low socio-economic status explaining this vitamin B12 deficiency and she was also treated with intramuscular cyanocobalamin."
