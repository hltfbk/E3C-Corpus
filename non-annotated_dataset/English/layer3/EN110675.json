  "text": "A 55-year-old woman presented to our hospital with an intermittent cramp in the lateral aspect of the right leg. The patient underwent Doppler US examination on bilateral lower extremity arteries and veins to examine potential vascular abnormality. Incidentally, US discovered the duplicated left SFA and CTA of bilateral lower extremities revealed the anatomic orientation, course, length, diameter and distance of the duplicated left SFA. It was revealed to be divided into two trunks with similar luminal diameter and courses parallel. They reunited at distal thigh level. The findings of US and CTA examination did not correspond with the symptom of the patient, and the patient was discharged."
