  "text": "A 69â€‰year-old male had blurred vision and foreign body sensation OD for several weeks. A rapidly-grown corneal mass was presented, showing an appearance of a grayish flesh-colored mass with elastic texture. Large vessels supplying the mass were also found. Anterior HR-OCT was performed, and the results suggested the lesion be benign hyperplasia. Superficial keratectomy was done, and the pathologic report showed mild-appearing epithelial squamous hyperplasia, which confirmed the analysis via anterior HR-OCT."
