  "text": "The patient was a 70-year-old male who presented with a 6-month history of vomiting, epigastric pain and weight loss. A gastroscopy revealed a large submucosal lesion originating in the fundus of the stomach and the biopsies were inconclusive. CT study revealed a 12x10x9 cm partially calcified mass with heterogeneous contrast enhancement on the fundal region and greater curvature of the stomach. The patient underwent a total gastrectomy associated to a distal splenopancreatectomy and segmental transverse colectomy. The final pathologic diagnosis was collision tumor of gastric GIST and pancreatic adenocarcinoma."
