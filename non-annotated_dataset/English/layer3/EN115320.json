  "text": "We describe a case of a 14 year-old-girl with a 3-year history of continuous pain in four rounded areas, all of them with the same size and shape. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were assessed on 21 points over the scalp and over the symptomatic areas. A pressure pain sensitivity map of the head was constructed. The neurological exam was unremarkable, with neither sensory symptoms nor trophic changes within the painful areas. As previously shown, symptomatic points exhibited lower PPTs compared to the surrounding areas. The map reflected 4 restricted areas of mechanical hyperalgesia confined just to the painful areas. Treatment with gabapentin achieved complete remission."
