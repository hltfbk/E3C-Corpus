  "text": "We report the case of an Adams-Stokes attack in an adolescent with acute rheumatic carditis and complete atrio-ventricular block. The attack was the first symptom of carditis.We reviewed the literature and could find 25 cases of complete atrio-ventricular block due to rheumatic fever. Ten of the 25 patients experienced an Adams-Stokes attack. Nineteen of the 25 patients were certainly in the pediatric age group. Seven of the 19 pediatric cases experienced an Adams-Stokes attack. In 16/25 cases, the duration of the atrio-ventricular block was reported: it lasted from a few minutes to ten days. Pacemaker implantation was necessary in 7 cases."
