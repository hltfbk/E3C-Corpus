  "text": "A 36-year-old married female was referred to the emergency department (ED) with severe pain of both lower extremities and gradual decreased mental status. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed acute multiple organ infarctions including the brain, spleen, and bilateral kidneys combined with Leriche syndrome. To evaluate the embolic source, echocardiography was performed and it revealed biatrial myxoma. Because of the risk of progression in systemic embolic events, surgical excision and embolectomy were performed urgently. After the operation, renal function was recovered, and the pain of both limbs was relieved. However, the visual field defect due to the brain infarction remained. She was discharged uneventfully on the fourteenth postoperative day."
