  "text": "A 74 year-old Caucasian woman with complete heart block and remote pacemaker implantation presents with a swollen and erythematous infected pacemaker pocket necessitating device extraction. Chest computerized tomographic imaging revealed a chronically perforating right atrial lead tip approximately 2 cm within the pericardial space. A successful hybrid transvenous and open surgical extraction approach was undertaken without the need for cardiopulmonary bypass; this was made possible due to a successfully positioned \"lead-inverting stitch\"."
