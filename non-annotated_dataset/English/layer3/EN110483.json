  "text": "A 20-year-old single male presented to the emergency department with scrotal rupture, left leg laceration and bleeding following a gunshot accident from a distance of 12-16 cm, which penetrated the scrotum and both testes and came out from the medial aspect of the left leg. The patient experienced severe pain in his scrotum and left lower extremity. Nothing significant was mentioned in his previous medical history. On arrival, he was noted to be conscious, and had no vomiting and no abdominal pain. In physical exam, his vital signs seemed normal (blood pressure: 120/75, pulse rate: 110 beats per minute), his abdomen was soft without tenderness, his scrotum had a big laceration, and both testes were completely ruptured. The exit wound was located in the medial aspect of the left knee. Other external genitalia were normal in inspection. He had no urethral meatus bleeding, but he had a laceration in the left leg. Blood profile tests such as complete blood cell, electrolyte profile, liver function test and coagulation test were normal; there was just a rise in WBC (white blood cell) 14000mg/dl. A focused assessment with ultrasonography for trauma (FAST) did not reveal any free fluid in the abdominal cavity. A plain film of the left leg showed a small fracture in the talus bone. After resuscitation, the patient was transferred to the operation room for urgent scrotal exploration. The patient was informed that an orchiectomy might be required if his testis cannot be repaired. After that, emergency scrotal exploration was done; about 200ml of the hematoma was evacuated, tunica vaginalis and both testes were exposed and completely damaged, and some gunshot fragment was identified and removed. Then, the scrotum was irrigated with 3000ml of normal saline. Debridement of necrotic testicular tissue was subsequently preformed. However, the ruptured testis could not be closed primarily because the extruded seminiferous tubules and the big tissue defect of the tunica albuginea did not allow the apposition of the tunica albugineal edges. Therefore, closure of the tunica albuginea using tunica vaginalis as a graft tissue was done (the free edges of the parietal tunica vaginalis was used to create neocapsulae around the testis parenchymal tissue) by using Vicryl suture bilaterally, and the drain was left in situ. Skin was closed with nylon 3/0. It should be mentioned that vas deference and epididymis were damaged, and we recommended the delayed repair of vas deference and epididymis with microsurgical procedure. Finally, Foley catheter Fr 16 was inserted. The laceration of the left leg was irrigated with 2000ml of normal saline and repaired by an orthoptist. During the same admission, the patient received ceftriaxone 2 gram daily and was under the joint care by the orthopedist. The drain and catheter were removed three-days post-operatively. The patient was discharged one-week later with outpatient follow up. Additionally, a three-week course of cephalexin and ibuprofen was recommended for the patient. Unfortunately, during post-operative period there were some complications in orthopedic and urologic procedures, such as fever and discharge from the site of operation. Additionally, the left testis was not viable and there was a need for orchiectomy during the follow up of one week. Follow-up Doppler ultrasonography at 4 months showed a viable right testis with minimal atrophic change. Four months after the surgery, the patient had normal erection and the anorchide serum hormone concentration such as (serum testosterone level was 6.27ng/ml, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 120.3nl/ml, luteinizing hormone (LH) 63.69nl/ml and the prolactin level was 11.05ng/ml), which show that the patient had borderline normal hormonal profile. The semen analysis showed the total sperm count: 12 million, volume: 2.5cc, motility: nonviable and normal forms: 70% and the patient was happy with the cosmetic results. Ethical consideration: the patient gave their written informed consent for participation in our study."
