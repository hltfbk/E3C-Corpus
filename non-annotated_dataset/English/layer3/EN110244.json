  "text": "1 st case A 60-year-old man, presented with severe chest pain, persistent fever and arthralgia for one month prior to admission. His coronary risk factors were hypertension and current smoking. He had no significant past medical history. Empiric treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanicacidfor2weeks was initiated at another clinic, but his fever had persisted. On admission, his blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, pulse rate was 105 beats/min. Physical examination revealed a systolic regurgitant murmur over the mitral valve area. Initial transthoracic echocardiography showed moderate mitral regurgitation, and an oscillating mass 14×3 mm on mitral valve. The diagnosis ofmitral valve IE was confirmed by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE); there was no annular abscess. The results of laboratory tests are shown as follows: the white blood cell count was 14,500 mm 3, hemoglobin concentration 9.3 g/l, creatinine 92 μmol/l and C-reactive protein 123 mg/dl. Computed topographics can of the head revealed no abnormalities. Initial blood cultures grew staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic treatment with Oxacillin + gentamicin was started. His symptoms improved within 72 hours later. Four days after admission, he felt a sudden onset of substernal chest pain. His ECG showed ST segment elevation in leads V 3 V 4, and emergency echocardiography revealed the disappearance of vegetation on the mitral valve. The coronary angiography noted a complete occlusion of the distal tract of the LAD artery, while the remaining coronary arteries were completely free from any stenosis/atherosclerotic lesion. After aspiration of the thrombus, the distal LAD occlusion resolved with restoration of TIMI flow grade 3. His complaints and ECG changes improved after the procedure, and he was discharged after the completion of 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment. 2 nd case A 72-year-old man, with a history of rheumatic heart disease, presented with a 2-month history of fever and lethargy. His coronary risk factors were age and hypertension.\nLaboratory tests revealed significant inflammatory syndrome (CRP=178 mg/l) and anemia (hemoglobin=10.1 g/dl). Renal function was correct. Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated fromperipheral blood cultures. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large circumferential periaortic abscess, and a doppler revealed moderate aortic regurgitation. TEE confirmed the same data \\(Figure 3). The patientwas diagnosed withIE, and treated with intravenous flucloxacillin and gentamicin. Computed tomographic scan of the head showed no abnormalities, and abdominal computed tomography scan found a mycotic aneurysm of a branch of the superior mesenteric artery measuring 13 mm. Three days after admission, the patient complained of worsening chest pain. The electrocardiogram showed significant anterior ST depression, and troponin I level rose to 5.3 ng/ml. Emergency coronary angiography noted an area of narrowing of the left main and LAD arteries. The patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery for further management. Emergency surgery confirmed a large aortic root abscess compressing the left main and LAD arteries. The patient underwent an obliteration of the abscess cavity, aortic valve replacementwith a bioprosthesis, annulus reconstruction using pericardium, and a single aortocoronary bypass graft using the left internal mammary artery. There was considerable difficulty in weaning the patient of by-pass, and despite intra-aortic balloon pumping, high dose catecholamine support and antibiotics, the patient died after 48h."
