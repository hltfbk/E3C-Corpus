  "text": "Here we report a rare case of partial molar pregnancy in which a normal-appearing male fetus with diploid karyotype was delivered at 31 weeks gestation by a 37-year-old white woman. The pregnancy was characterized by an episode of threatened abortion in the first trimester and an ultrasonographic diagnosis of intrauterine growth restriction. Our patient did not report any suspicious symptoms for trophoblastic disease. Due to impaired umbilical artery velocimetry with an absence of the diastolic phase, she underwent an emergency caesarean section at 31 weeks and delivered an 880 g male baby. The male baby was normal without any complications at 3-month and 12-month follow-up and the mother had no evidence of recurrence after 3 and 12 months of follow-up. Pathological examination of the placenta showed changes of partial hydatidiform mole."
