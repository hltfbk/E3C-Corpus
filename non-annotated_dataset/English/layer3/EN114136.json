  "text": "An 18-year-old man reported sudden vision loss 24 days after SMILE procedure. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 36.3 mmHg (OD) and 36.7 mmHg (OS) by noncontact tonometry. Moderate corneal edema, interface fluid pocket and haze were observed by OCT and confirmed by corneal densitometry values. Discontinuation of steroids and addition of hypotensive medication were offered immediately. The symptoms were cured after the medication. Changes of corneal densitometry were consistent with the clinical course of IFS."
