  "text": "The chief complaints of a 16-year-old girl with EDS were double upper limb weakness for 7 years and double lower limb walking instability for 2 years. Moreover, the imaging results revealed that the degree of kyphosis from cervical vertebra 2 to 4 accompanying with spinal cord compression was 30Â°. An anterior cervical corpectomy involving cervical vertebra 3 and a titanium mesh implant were performed with internal fixation. The results at 3 mo after surgery demonstrated that the anterior fusion was solid, and the kyphosis of the cervical spine was corrected. Additionally, the power of all four extremities was significantly improved."
