  "text": "This report describes the first case of an Italian young girl featuring pPNH and severe hyperphagic obesity. At the time of our first examination at age 3 years of age she was severely obese (body mass index, BMI 45.9 Kg/m(2)) and food-seeking behavior in the free-living situation was reported by the relatives. She showed normal linear growth and cognition, but mildly dysmorphic facial traits including deeply-set eyes, prominent zygomatic bones, downturned mouth corners and low-set ears. Over the years, the patient progressively developed further massive weight gain (at age 9 years, her BMI was 60.4 Kg/m(2)) and hyperphagia was confirmed by an ad libitum test meal. During follow-up, she presented limitations in walking capacity and in physical functioning due to the disabling obesity. On the basis of distinctive neuro-radiological findings pPNH was diagnosed, in absence of history of seizures."
