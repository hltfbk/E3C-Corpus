  "text": "A 27-year old male presented to our emergency ward with a complaint of diffuse abdominal pain started 6 hours before. He was afraid because the day before he has ingested 4 kilogram of hashish. Physical examinations reveal a cardiac rhythm of 92 bpm, a blood pressure of 132/ 78 mmHg and diffuse abdominal tenderness without defense. Blood tests and urine drug screening were normal. A plain abdominal X-ray demonstrated multiple \"body packers\" in the stomach, along the intestinal tract and the rectum. We started oral and rectal laxative treatment and the patient was admitted in intensive care unit. After three days, the patient eliminated spontaneously all the packets and was discharged from hospital."
