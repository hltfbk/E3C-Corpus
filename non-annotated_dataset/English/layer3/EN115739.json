  "text": "A 16-year-old Bangladeshi boy presented with severe respiratory distress and cyanosis with a history of live fish impaction in the throat. To relieve respiratory distress and secure life an emergency tracheostomy was carried out while a tail fin of a fish was seen through tracheostome directed to the right bronchus which was grasped with an artery forceps and pulled out of the trachea. Respiratory distress was relieved immediately. The fish removed from the trachea was locally known as Guchi Baim Fish (Macrognathus pancalus). It was about 16 cm long and about 2 cm wide at its central region."
