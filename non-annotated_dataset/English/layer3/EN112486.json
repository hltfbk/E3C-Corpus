  "text": "A 60-year-old man was admitted for further workup of left shoulder pain. He was assessed by the orthopaedics team and booked for internal fixation of the left clavicle. General anaesthesia with a nerve block was administered. His blood pressure continued to decrease post-operation. Endocrine tests were performed, with the results supporting a diagnosis of hypopituitarism with hypocortisolism and hypothyroidism. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the sella was enlarged and filled with CSF, confirming a diagnosis of empty sella syndrome. The patient was started on endocrine replacement therapy. The patient regained consciousness and spontaneous breath finally."
