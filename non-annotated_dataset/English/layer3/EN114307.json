  "text": "The patient had a history of hypertension, laryngeal cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a cerebral arteriovenous malformation hemorrhage, he underwent surgery to remove the hematoma and began rehabilitation. On day 66 of hospitalization, he suddenly developed a fever, and coarse crackles and wheezes were heard in his right lung. A diagnosis of hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia was made, and initial treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam was started. Teicoplanin was added after S. pneumoniae was isolated from the blood culture, however, the patient died 5Â days later. The S. pneumoniae detected in the sputum smear was serotype 3, showed mucoid colonies and susceptibility to penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, and levofloxacin, but resistance to erythromycin."
