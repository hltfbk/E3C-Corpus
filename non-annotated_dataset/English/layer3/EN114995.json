  "text": "The first case was a 76-year-old Asian female who presented with pharyngeal discomfort and anterior chest ecchymosis. Endoscopic investigation showed submucosal hemorrhage in the pharynx and larynx. The second case was a 62-year-old Asian male who presented with anterior chest ecchymosis and suspected of a ruptured blood vessel. Both cases were diagnosed parathyroid adenoma with extracapsular bleeding by hypercalcemia, high levels of intact parathyroid hormone and presence of a nodule behind the thyroid. Both cases were treated with excision of tumor 7 months after initial presentation. After surgery, serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels had decreased to normal level in both cases."
