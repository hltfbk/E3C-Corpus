  "text": "A 22﻿-year﻿-old gentleman posted for open reduction and internal fixation of both﻿ forearm bones was administered an ultrasound﻿-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block. The intra-operative period was uneventful. However, the block persisted for a very prolonged period of time. All perceivable causes were ruled out. A total of 19 weeks was required for the entire block to regress with no residual neurological deficits thereafter."
