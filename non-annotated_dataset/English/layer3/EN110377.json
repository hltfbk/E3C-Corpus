  "text": "A 28 year old female patient sought medical advice due to a painful tumefaction of the left shoulder which appeared four years ago and slowly increased in volume. The medical examination revealed that the patient did not have an old trauma nor did she have any medical or surgical antecedents. The physical examination showed a visible tumefaction, on the posterior side of the left shoulder. It is 20cm long; it is not well defined; and it is hard, painless, fixed compared to the two other plans. The mobility of the left shoulder is maintained but it is painful. The ganglionic areas are free. The somatic examination did not reveal any particularity. The chondroma evolves in a context of apyrexia and conservation of the general state. The radiography of the shoulder showed an image of calcium tone sitting in the soft parts without attachment to the periosteum. The CT scan individualized the presence of a lesional process of the left sub-scapular fossa; it is well-defined and it developed in the subscapularis muscle. It has a pharu-labile form; it is heterogeneous and hypodense and it contains multiple and sometimes incomplete partitions and calcifications. This process is increases heterogeneously after the injection of the contrast agent and the delimitation of the fluid areas. The MRI revealed a lesional process of the left sub-scapular fossa in isosignal T1, hypersignal T2, heterogeneous, containing multiple incomplete partitions heightened after the injection of gadolinium leaving necrosis spots and hypo-signal T2 foci that corresponded to calcifications. The process is limited by a pseudo-capsule and measures 13/09/10 cm. The surgical excision of the tumor was easy. In preoperative, the tumor was hard, well defined, poly-lobbed, and stuck to the front side of the scapula. The macroscopic examination reveals a mass measuring 12 x 10 x 10cm with slightly irregular contours and a crudely well circumscribed aspect in periphery. At the cut, there is a cartilaginous consistency and aspects in cauliflower of white, pearly color. The histological study of the various extractions shows a cartilaginous tumor proliferation organized in lobules. The cellularity within these lobules is moderate made up of discretely anisocaryotic chondrocytes, sometimes binucleated and whose periphery presents an enchondral ossification. The overgrowth is surrounded by a thick capsule. After a 24 months follow up, the patient is asymptomatic without any sign of recurrence at the MRI examination."
