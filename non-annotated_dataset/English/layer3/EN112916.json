  "text": "A 20-year-old Chinese man was referred for repeated fever, sudden headache, diplopia with a bilateral best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 10/20, ptosis in both eyes and restricted abduction on the right side. VF tests showed bitemporal hemianopsia. Laboratory tests revealed hypothyroidism and were negative for autoimmune markers. Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed pituitary enlargement. The diagnosis was lymphocytic pituitaritis. After intravenous (IV) dexamethasone treatment, full recovery occurred within 2 months. Two years later, the patient was readmitted for headache recurrence. With oral prednisone, the visual acuity in his right eye rapidly decreased to hand motion (HM) within one month. Enhanced MRI showed pituitary enlargement and a new, invasive suprasellar CNS lesion. All infection- and autoimmune-related tests were negative. The visual acuity in his right and left eye decreased to no light perception (NLP) after 6 days and 2 weeks, respectively. The biopsy results suggested GPA. After IV methylprednisolone treatment, complete remission of the symptoms occurred and was confirmed by MRI. The 15-month follow-up showed no signs of recurrence."
