  "text": "The first patient was a 48-year-old-Asian woman who presented with serum growth hormone 6.99 ng/ml and insulin-like growth factor 1 of 476 ng/ml, but no characteristic features of acromegaly. Five years after initial diagnosis, she presented with acromegalic facial appearance. Transsphenoidal surgery achieved gross total removal and endocrinological remission. The second patient was a 40-year-old-Asian woman who presented with serum growth hormone 31.14 ng/ml and insulin-like growth factor 1 of 709.6 ng/ml, but no characteristic features of acromegaly. Three years after initial diagnosis, she presented with acromegalic facial appearance. Transsphenoidal surgery achieved gross total removal and endocrinological remission. The third patient was a 64-year-old-Asian woman who presented with serum growth hormone 6.0 ng/ml and insulin-like growth factor 1 of 341 ng/ml, but no characteristic features of acromegaly. Eight months after initial diagnosis, hand enlargement was detected. Transsphenoidal surgery achieved gross total removal and endocrinological remission."
