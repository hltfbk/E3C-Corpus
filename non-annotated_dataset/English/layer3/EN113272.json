  "text": "Elderly female was operated for seronegative subtalar joint arthritis with fusion plus primary bone grafting. Fusion did not progress in spite of every added efforts such as extended immobilization, calcium supplements, and antibiotic therapy. Revision surgery was undertaken considering the reason of failure being a low-grade infection. At a revision surgery, case was diagnosed as a case of tuberculosis of subtalar joint, a very rare presentation. Fusion succeeded just with addition of antituberculous therapy supported with short-term immobilization."
