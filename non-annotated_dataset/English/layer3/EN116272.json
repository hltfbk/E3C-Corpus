  "text": "A 49-year-old Greek man developed bilateral irreversible blindness after accidental methanol intoxication. He underwent complete ophthalmological examination, including electroretinogram, visual evoked potentials, multifocal-visual evoked potentials, and optical coherence tomography scan of the optic nerve. Complete laboratory evaluation, urine drug testing, neurological examination, and computed tomography scans were also performed. Visual acuity demonstrated no light perception bilaterally, pupils were semi-dilated and unreactive to light, while the retina was normal in both eyes. Electroretinogram was normal, while visual evoked potentials, multifocal-visual evoked potentials recording, and optical coherence tomography scanning of both optic nerve heads were pathological in both eyes. The neurological examination and the computed tomography scans did not reveal any abnormalities. The laboratory evaluation was normal and the urine drug test was negative for benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, salicylates, barbiturates, and phencyclidine."
