  "text": "A 45 years old male, he had uncomplicated type 2 diabetes for at least 7 years treated by insulin. He was admitted in June 2011 in the nephrology department of Hassan II university hospital (Fez, Morocco) for nephritic syndrome with advanced acute kidney injury. The clinical exam has showed a conscious patient, hypertensive at 220/120 mm Hg, the heart rate was at135b/mn, the FR=25c/mn. He was oliguric with lower limbs edema and crackles on pulmonary auscultation. The dipstick test was positive for proteinuria (+) and microscopic hematuria (+ +). The serum creatinine was more than 1000 mmol/l, urea at 38mmol/l, without electrolytes disturbances. Proteinuria was at 2g per day. He has an anemia at 10g/dl without thrombocytopenia or leucopenia. Immunological tests (ANCA and anti-MBG) were negative and the complement C3 was consumed. Viral hepatitis B serology was positive (HBs+ Ag, HBe+Ac, HBe-Ag and HBc+ Ac (IgG+IgM). HBV-DNA was positive by PCR with a viral load of 284ui/ml. liver cytolysis was absent. Others viral serology tests (HVC, HVD, HIV) were negative. The abdominal ultrasound was normal and the fibroscan wasn't showed liver fibrosis. According to international recommendations [2, 3]. The diagnostic of HBV inactive carrier has been retained. Renal biopsy was performed to identify the causes of this nephritic syndrome, which showed a diffuse and global endocapillary proliferation without extra-capillary proliferation or endo-extra membranous deposits. There were global glomeruli deposits of C3 and Ig G on immunofluorescence. In conclusion, the post-infectious glomerulonephritis diagnosis related to Hepatitis B virus was retained because of the presence of HBV replication and the absence of others infectious causes. The patient has received a strong antiviral treatment by Entecavir 0.5 mg per week adapted to renal function. 15 days later, he has received methylprednisolone bolus 10mg/kg/day (three consecutive days) relayed by oral prednisone 0.5mg/kg/day under cover of antiviral treatment. In parallel, the patient required hemodialysis for advanced acute kidney injury. One month later, evolution was marked by the improvement of renal function and negativity of viral load. The patient was weaned off dialysis sessions, and we have increased gradually the dosage of entecavir. Renal function became normal after 3 months. Corticotherapy was stopped at six months while antiviral therapy was continued. There was no relapse of glomerulonephritis and HBV viral load was still negative after one year follow-up."
