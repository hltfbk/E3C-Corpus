  "text": "A 10-year-old child presented with a 7-day history of progressively increasing insidious onset pain in the lower back radiating to the right hip, with an associated limp and restriction of floor level activities and activities of daily living. On examination, the child had tenderness at L3, L4, and L5 vertebral level and normal neurology in both lower limbs. A pseudoflexion deformity 20Â° was also noted in the right hip with normal range of motion in other planes. Keeping a differential of infective etiology of either hip or spine, routine blood investigations, blood culture, and radiological evaluation were done which included X-rays of lumbosacral spine and hip, ultrasound of bilateral hips and abdomen, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lumbosacral spine. The blood investigations showed an increase in white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, with the isolation of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus in blood culture. Ultrasonography of hip showed mild effusion in the right hip and collections in the psoas; MRI confirmed the findings with an enhancement of L4 vertebral body."
