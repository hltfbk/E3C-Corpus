  "text": "A 62 years old male patient presented in the hospital's emergency department with symptoms indicating a subacute cerebrovascular event. Immediate sonographic studies showed a right-sided pulsatile Doppler-signal in the common and internal carotid arteries, suggestive of distal stenoses. In addition, the transcranial examination indicated obliteration of both middle cerebral arteries. Numerous arterial vessels suggestive of leptomeningeal collateral arteries revealed a strong arterial leptomeningeal flow. At this stage of the diagnostic work-up, the collateral circulation network, characteristic of moyamoya disease, was indicated by sonography. Moyamoya syndrome was verified by conventional angiography. The aetiological work remained empty, so the diagnosis of moyamoya disease was established."
