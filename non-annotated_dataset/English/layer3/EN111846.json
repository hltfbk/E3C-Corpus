  "text": "A 3-year-old Caucasian girl presented to the Paediatric ED, with 6 days' history of general malaise, vomiting, and intermittent pyrexia. 5 days before prior to attendance, she also developed a limp, which progressively worsened until she refused to weight bear on the left side with obvious distress and pain. No history of trauma was reported. According to the parents, she had become more irritable each day. The patient had no significant medical history and no family history of congenital or developmental hip disorders. Her vital signs were in keeping with sepsis as she was tachycardiac (154) and pyrexial (38.1°). The referring GP also recorded a high temperature of 38.9°. Physical examination proved difficult, due to pain. No obvious erythema or swelling was noted around either groin or lower limb. When asked to walk, she held the left hip in flexion and refused to weight bear."
