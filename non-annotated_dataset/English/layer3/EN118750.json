  "text": "We report a case of a 73-year-old white male who sought medical help for symptoms of cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. A chest X-ray was done revealing multiple \"cannon ball\" infiltrates involving all segments of the lung parenchyma. Fine-needle aspiration cytology under computed tomography guidance of a subpleural lesion revealed adenocarcinomatous cells. Despite the absence of any detectable osseous lesions and with the presence of multiple hilar, mediastinal, para-aortic, and pelvic lymphadenopathy, the patient had a complete work-up in search for the primary adenocarcinoma. His prostate specific antigen was 146 ng/ml and a prostatic biopsy done, revealing an acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma. A tru-cut biopsy of a lung lesion under computed tomography guidance showed a metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma positive for prostate specific antigen stain."
