  "text": "We report a rare case of transverse colon volvulus in a 42-year-old Arabic man, with no particular history, who presented to our emergency department with a 5-day history of constipation, progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. His last bowel movement had been 3 days ago. Abdominal radiography showed a large bowel obstruction with a \"U-shaped\" loop in the left upper abdomen. Abdominal computed tomography was not performed because of impaired renal function. He was operated on urgently after conditioning and the diagnosis of a transverse colon volvulus was done intraoperatively. Rotated in a 360° clockwise direction on its mesentery, the bowel was intact without signs of ischemia. An extended right hemicolectomy was carried out with end-to-side ileocolic anastomosis. Through this case, we will try to discuss its physiopathology, etiologies, diagnosis, and management in emergencies."
