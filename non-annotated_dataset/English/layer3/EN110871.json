  "text": "Here, we describe the case of a 50-year-old man with cervical myelopathy and OALL that resulted in difficult endotracheal intubation after induction of anesthesia. Radiography and magnetic resonance imaging findings showed OALL, with prominent osteophytes involving four cervical vertebrae, a bulge in the posterior pharyngeal wall, and a narrow pharyngeal space. AirtraqÂ® laryngoscope-assisted intubation was accomplished with rapid induction under sevoflurane-inhaled anesthesia."
