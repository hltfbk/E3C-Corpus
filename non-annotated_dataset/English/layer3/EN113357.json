  "text": "A 31-year-old Cameroonian (black African) housewife with a JADELLE® implant for 13 months, consulted at our hospital for a 1-month history of pelvic pain, prolonged menstrual bleeding, and spotting. She had a last normal menstrual period 8 weeks 1 day prior to presentation. On examination, there was suprapubic tenderness and blood trickling from her cervix. Despite a negative qualitative urine pregnancy test, an empty intrauterine gestational sac with mean sac diameter of 28 mm was visualized on pelvic ultrasound. Dilation and curettage with suction was done and she had complete relief from symptoms."
