  "text": "Case 1: we report the case of a 58-year-old smoker and alcoholic man bearer of chronic hepatitis B who was referred with sensorimotor deficit of right upper limb with epigastric pain. The radiograph of the right humerus was normal. Ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography (CT) had concluded that the presence of hyper-vascularized hepatic lesions. The spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the presence of bone metastases in thoracolumbar spine and spinal cord compression in relation to the seventh dorsal vertebra. Biopsy of liver nodules under coelioscopy confirmed the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on cirrhotic liver. The patient had Child Pugh A. He had received a decompressive radiotherapy of bone metastases of the thoracic spine from D5 to D9 at a dose of 30Gy and was treated with steroids. A month later, the patient consulted for two masses in the right supraclavicular and the left base of the thorax with persistence of the sensorimotor deficit of right upper limb. Standard radiograph of the right humerus showed an osteolytic lesion with cortical break of the upper third of the right humerus. A new spinal MRI showed a large right supraclavicular mass with dorsal extension at C7-D1, secondary spinal and rib lesions and posterior epiduritis at C7. The patient had an osteosynthesis of the right humerus with right cervico humeral radiotherapy at dose of 30Gy with improvement of symptoms. The patient is currently proposed for a targeted therapy with sorafenib and bisphosphonate. Case 2: we report the case of a 62-year-old smoker and nonalcoholic man bearer of chronic hepatitis B with cirrhosis who had consulted for chronic diarrhea with weight loss. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a chronic liver disease with hyperechoic lesion of the segment V. Abdominal computed tomography showed hypodense lesions in the liver dome, segment V and VI. Hepatic MRI showed 3 hepatic lesions which evoked hepatocellular carcinoma. Biopsy of liver nodules confirmed the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma on active cirrhotic liver. The patient had Child Pugh A. One month later, he consulted for spinal pain with motor deficit from a week ago. The spinal MRI showed the presence of bone metastases in thoracolumbar spine and spinal cord compression in relation to the twelfth dorsal vertebra. Bone scan showed increased uptake at the right trochonter and D5-7-12. Our patient had received a decompressive radiotherapy of bone metastases of the thoracic spine from D10 to L1 at a dose of 30Gy and was treated with steroids with mobility improvement. He is currently proposed for a targeted therapy with sorafenib and bisphosphonate."
