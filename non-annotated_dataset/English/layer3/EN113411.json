  "text": "To underline the importance of including this pathology in the differential diagnosis of IDA and abdominal pain, we present the case of a 14Â year-old girl with a huge trichobezoar which completely filled the stomach and extended into the small bowel. Since trichobezoar has an extension to the small bowel, it is classified as Rapunzel syndrome. As the bezoar couldn't be removed by endoscopy, the girl underwent surgical intervention. The patient passed through a gradual re-feeding, with iron and vitamins supplementation, and through a psychiatric counselling."
