  "text": "A 64-year-old woman admitted to our hospital with a 1 month history of dyspnea. Her medical history also revealed that she received antibiotic and anticoagulant therapy for diagnosis of PTE and pneumonia in the past 2 weeks but had no clinical improvement. Physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory test showed elevated D-dimer level (1990 ng/ml) and C-reactive protein (16.6 mg/dl). Levels of tumor markers were normal. Transthoracic echocardiography showed high pulmonary artery pressure (65 mmHg). She underwent CTPA with suspicion of pulmonary emboli. Thrombus at the lower extremities was not detected on venous Doppler ultrasound. CTPA demonstrated intraluminal filling defect at the pulmonary trunk extending right and left pulmonary arteries. Expansion of the involved pulmonary arteries and extension to segmental-subsegmental branches were also noted. In addition, increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake was detected at the level of the filling defects by subsequent positron emission tomography (PET) - computed tomography (CT) scan. The patient underwent tru-cut lung biopsy and histopathologic examination revealed pulmonary artery sarcoma. Chemotherapy was started but she died two months after initial presentation."
