  "text": "A 57-year-old man with acute inferior wall ST elevation myocardial infarction underwent a primary coronary intervention of the acutely occluded right coronary artery. Six hours after the intervention, the patient had a severe UGIB, followed by vomiting. His hemoglobin level dropped from 15.3 g/dL to 9.7 g/dL. In addition to blood transfusion and a gastric acid inhibition treatment, early endoscopy was employed and MWS was diagnosed. Bleeding was stopped by endoscopic placement of titanium clips."
