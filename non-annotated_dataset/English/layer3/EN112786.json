  "text": "We report a patient with congenital tibiofibular diastasis, who was initially treated with series of casts and later with ankle arthrodesis, but the deformity and LLDleg length discrepancy remained. We applied an Ilizarov frame and initially corrected the varus and equinus deformity of the foot. Then, we corrected the LLD leg length discrepancy with limb lengthening with distraction osteogenesis. We achieved a plantigrade stable limb, with a small amount of length inequality."
