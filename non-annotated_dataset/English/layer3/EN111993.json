  "text": "A seven-month-old female Kooikerhondje dog was treated with Bravecto® at the recommended dose. About 24 h after administration, the dog exhibited signs of neurological toxicity, including generalized ataxia, myoclonic jerks, tremor of head and body, muscle twitching and oral dysphagia. All symptoms were transient and the dog fully recovered without any treatment after 10 h."
