  "text": "A 72-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of hypoglycemia and a large pelvic tumor. His blood glucose level was 52 mg/dl; serum insulin level, 1.0 μIU/ml; C-peptide level, 0.2 ng/ml; and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) level, 31 ng/ml. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a 13-cm mass in the pelvic cavity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lobulated tumor with iso- and high-intensity areas combined in T2-weighted images. No clear invasion to any adjacent organs was identified. The tumor was resected, and hypoglycemic symptoms disappeared immediately. Pathological diagnosis was an SFT with malignant potential that secreted IGF-II and caused hypoglycemia. There has been no tumor recurrence during the 1 year of follow-up."
