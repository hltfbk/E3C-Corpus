  "text": "A 21-year-old woman with a silent medical history was admitted to the Emergency Department of our hospital complaining of fever of 38-39 °C (mainly in the evening) for the past 10 days and left flank abdominal pain, accompanied by sweating and fatigue. An abdominal computed tomography showed multiple splenic nodules of unknown origin. Because of the absence of clinical improvement after several antibiotic therapiesand a positron emission tomography (PET) with hypercaptation strictly localized to spleen, she underwent splenectomy, in suspicion of lymphoma. For persistence of symptoms after splenectomy, she underwent many instrumental examination, including a colonoscopy with bowel and intestinal biopsies that poses diagnosis of Crohn's disease. A second PET confirmed this diagnosis showing this time also the gastrointestinal involvement."
