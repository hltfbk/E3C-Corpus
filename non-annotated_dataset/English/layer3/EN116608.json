  "text": "Four years ago (2005), a 19-year-old Chinese woman was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and provided prednisone treatment. A combination of prednisone and cyclophosphamide did not have any effect and was discontinued after six months. Although she was steroid-resistant, over the next subsequent three years, she maintained normal renal function without anemia and thrombocytopenia. In February 2009, she had a severe headache and blurry vision and presented at a local hospital with severe hypertension. Blood pressure was 220/160 mmHg. Laboratory data showed hemoglobin 3.8 g/dL; platelet counts 29 × 10(9)/L; urinary protein 7.90 g/d; total bilirubin 29.9 umol/L; indirect bilirubin 28.2 umol/L; LDH 1172 U/L; ALB 2.66 g/dL; urea nitrogen 52 mg/dL; serum creatinine 3.2 mg/dL; triglyceride 25  mg/dL; total cholesterol 273 mg/dL. ANA, ds-DNA, ANCA, anti-GBM antibody and anticardiolipin were all negative. A renal biopsy revealed LPG with TMA. Genetic evaluation showed the patient carried the APOE Kyoto mutation. Adequate control of blood pressure improved microangiopathic anemia and thrombocytopenia, however, renal function did not improve and she eventually developed uremia and became hemodialysis dependent."
