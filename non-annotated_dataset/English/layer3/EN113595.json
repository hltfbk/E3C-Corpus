  "text": "A 73-year-old woman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma on treatment with pazopanib presented with progressive inability to ambulate. The initial concern was for metastasis to the spine. However, MRI of the spine revealed diffuse muscle edema with no metastatic deposits or lytic lesions. Upon further evaluation, creatine kinase was significantly elevated and the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis was made. With aggressive hydration and discontinuation of both pazopanib and rosuvastatin, the patient made a full recovery."
