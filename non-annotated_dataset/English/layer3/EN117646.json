  "text": "A 44-year-old Middle Eastern man with a previously implanted prosthetic mitral valve presented with exertional dyspnea and orthopnea. Investigations revealed a thrombosed prosthetic mitral valve. Successful thrombolysis was achieved using tenecteplase which lead to the complete restoration of valve function with no risk to the patient."
