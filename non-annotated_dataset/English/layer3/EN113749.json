  "text": "A 30-year-old man presented to the ED after \"falling into a hole\" with his back and had direct blunt abdominal trauma by a heavy bag of cement. In physical examination, there was a mild abdominal tenderness on right upper quadrant. On bedside ultrasonography, there was small free fluid in his Morison's pouch without hypotension. So abdominal CT scan was performed which revealed free fluid in pelvic, perihepatic, and perisplenic spaces. Mural hematoma of proximal part of jejunum with mural wall hypodensity in mid jejunal loop were also revealed. The patient underwent surgery, and there was damage to the colon serosa and jejunal perforation which was primarily repaired."
