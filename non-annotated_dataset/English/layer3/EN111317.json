  "text": "A 6-year-old boy presented with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) involving left arm after fever and respiratory symptoms for 6 days. Computed Tomography (CT) revealed inflammation in both lungs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine showed swelling in the left frontal lobe and brain stem. The patient was diagnosed with meningomyelitis. EV-D68 was detected from pharyngeal samples 36 days after the onset of the disease."
