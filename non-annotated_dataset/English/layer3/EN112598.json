  "text": "We present herewith a 26-year-old male patient with symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea. He was diagnosed with aneurysmal dilatation of the right coronary artery in its entire course which terminated as a fistulous communication into the left atrium. The closure of the fistula was done using autologous pericardial patch under cardiopulmonary bypass. Currently, the patient is being followed up after surgery and receiving anticoagulants."
