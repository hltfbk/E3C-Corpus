  "text": "A 51-year-old male was referred to our hospital with abdominal pain and hypotension. We made a preoperative diagnosis of peritonitis with septic shock and performed an emergency operation. Intraoperative findings indicated no marked origin of the peritonitis. Preoperative blood culture showed the presence of group A hemolytic streptococcus. The patient required intensive care involving artificial respiration, abdominal drainage and cytokine absorption therapy, and was discharged on postoperative day 25."
