  "text": "A 40-year-old man was referred to our hospital chiefly for a fever and right upper abdominal pain with dark urine. Enhanced computed tomography showed thickening of the gallbladder wall and a mass in the gallbladder neck with involvement of the hepatic bile ducts, which was suspected to be malignant. Gallbladder malignancy with bile duct invasion was ruled out by subsequent endoscopic examinations, including endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography, intraductal ultrasound, and SpyGlass. Endoscopic examinations showed a homogeneous hyperechoic lesion with smooth margins of benign bile duct stricture suggestive of inflammatory stenosis of the bile duct. The patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. GAM was postoperatively diagnosed and confirmed based on the histopathology results, which are consistent with the preoperative diagnosis. Notably, no malignant event occurred in the patient during a 12-mo follow-up period."
