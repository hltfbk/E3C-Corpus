  "text": "A 27 year old female presented with a partially absorbed cataractous lens that was dislocated into the anterior chamber of her left eye. There was mild anterior chamber reaction. She reported no history of ocular trauma; but associated findings and further investigations were in favour of a post-traumatic aetiology."
