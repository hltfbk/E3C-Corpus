  "text": "A 33-year-old Turkey hunter was attacked by a bobcat and his injuries included a ruptured globe with corneal laceration, two iris sphincter tears, and a ruptured anterior capsule with a traumatic cataract. Rabies vaccination was started, primary closure of the corneal laceration, an anterior chamber washout and one week later cataract surgery were performed. Three months postoperatively he achieved an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/50 and a best corrected visual acuity of 20/20."
