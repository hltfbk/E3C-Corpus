  "text": "A 78-year-old woman was referred to our department for the examination of a tumor in the pancreatic head. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a low-density tumor of 40Â mm in diameter located in the pancreatic head. The involvement of the common hepatic artery (CHA), the root of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA), and portal vein was noted. Although such cases would usually require PD with arterial reconstruction of the CHA, it was thought that the hepatic arterial flow would be preserved by the anastomotic site between the root of the CHA and the PHA, even if the CHA was dissected without arterial reconstruction. PD with dissection of the CHA and PHA was safely completed without arterial reconstruction, and sufficient hepatic arterial flow was preserved through the anastomotic site between the CHA and PHA."
