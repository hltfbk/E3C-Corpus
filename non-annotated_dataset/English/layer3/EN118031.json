  "text": "A 45-years-old Greek man with intra-articular calcaneal fracture was treated with closed reduction and balloon assisted augmentation with calcium phosphate cement. Follow-up was performed using the Maryland foot score, plain radiographs and multidirectional computerized tomography. Early full weight-bearing was performed at the end of the first week postoperatively. There was no need for secondary reconstructive procedures at the 2 year follow-up. The patient had minimal problems regarding the pain, subtalar motion and peroneal impingement. There was no significant further collapse of the subtalar calcaneal articular surface radiologically."
