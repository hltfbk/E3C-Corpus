  "text": "A 25-year-old African American female presented to the Emergency Department complaining of diffuse abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting for 2 days. Her past medical history was significant for seasonal allergies and family history was pertinent for discoid lupus in her father and SLE in a cousin. The patient's vital signs on presentation were normal. Her physical exam was remarkable for significant lower abdominal tenderness without guarding or rigidity. A computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed marked circumferential wall thickening and edema of the proximal and mid small bowel predominantly involving the submucosa. Our main differential diagnoses were intestinal angioedema and mesenteric vein thrombosis. However, mesenteric vessels were patent, and laboratory testing for hereditary angioedema showed a normal C1 Esterase Inhibitor level and low C3 and C4 levels. Infectious work-up was negative. Autoimmune tests showed elevated anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) (13.6), anti-Smith antibody, and anti-ribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP) antibody. The patient was diagnosed with SLE enteritis. She was maintained on bowel rest, given intravenous hydration, and started on methylprednisolone 60 mg IV daily. She had significant improvement in her abdominal pain, diarrhea, and emesis after 2 days of treatment. Steroids were tapered and maintained on Hydroxychloroquine with no relapses one year after presentation."
