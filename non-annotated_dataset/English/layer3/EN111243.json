  "text": "Here we present a case of a 84-year-old woman with anorexia, dysphagia and unintentional weight loss initially diagnosed as achalasia. Upon further investigation a rare cause of pseudoachalasia due to vascular compression of the esophagus was found. It could have been overlooked due to the fact that the initial work-out with a barium swallow, manometry and endoscopy was suggestive for primary achalasia."
