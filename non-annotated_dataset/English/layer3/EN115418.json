  "text": "Here, we described the clinical presentations, muscle biopsy studies and laboratory results of two siblings with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) who were affected with lumbar lordosis. Computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrated marked paraspinal muscle atrophy in both patients. Immunohistochemical studies of biopsy tissue obtained from one of the patients revealed inflammatory change of the muscle. Upon oral prednisolone therapy, the patient showed improvement in muscle strength and serum creatine kinase (CK) level."
