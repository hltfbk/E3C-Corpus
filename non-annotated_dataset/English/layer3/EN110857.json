  "text": "We present a rare case of primary ECSCSs in the left ovary. A 39-year-old female patient had persistent dull pain in the lower abdomen for more than 1 mo, and she was initially diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease at a hospital. The patient received transabdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection at our hospital and finally diagnosed with ECSCSs. After the operation, the patient received eight courses of cisplatinum + etoposide + bleomycin chemotherapy treatment and no evidence of tumor recurrence or metastasis was found in a 2-year follow-up period."
