  "text": "A male 8-year-old child presented with pain in his left knee and difficulties to walk after a combined injury of falling and contact trauma. Radiographic studies with conventional X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan depicted a fracture of the intercondylar eminence. In this Type II fracture according to the classification of Meyers and McKeever, an operative treatment with knee arthroscopy was established to remove the loose bone. Post-operative, the knee was immobilized in extension for 4 weeks. Physiotherapy was initiated immediately after surgery. The follow-up CT scan 6weeks after injury showed a starting consolidation and the magnetic resonance imaging scan 8 weeks after injury a complete consolidation of the fracture."
