  "text": "An 18-year-old woman presented with severe vision loss in both eyes. A fundus examination revealed a foveal grayish-white lesion, and optical coherence tomography revealed outer retinal damage. She was diagnosed with serpiginous choroiditis and treated with steroid pulse therapy, but the disease progressed continuously. The addition of sub-Tenon's injection of triamcinolone and oral cyclosporine did not change the disease course. We also administered subcutaneous injections of adalimumab, but even with the intensive treatment, the retinal lesions and subsequent atrophy progressed. Her right and left visual acuity declined from 20/22 to 20/66 and 20/200, respectively, during the 9â€‰months of follow-up."
