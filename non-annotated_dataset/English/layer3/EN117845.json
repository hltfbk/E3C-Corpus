  "text": "We report the case of a 59 year-old woman with a medical history of hyperaldosteronism due to a right adrenal adenoma. During follow up, she showed symptoms of hypercortisolism and hyperandrogenemia and a rapid growth of the adrenal mass. She underwent right adrenalectomy and the histology revealed the presence of an adrenocortical carcinoma. Six months post-operatively being on treatment with mitotane, she was diagnosed of metastatic disease to the liver. She underwent right hepatectomy and was started on systemic chemotherapy, with no signs of tumour recurrence during the following six months."
