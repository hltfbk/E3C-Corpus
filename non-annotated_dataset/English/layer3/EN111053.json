  "text": "A 19-year-old male was diagnosed with KC due to a rapid decline in visual acuity within a short period of time. Ocular examination revealed the presence of ring-shaped, dense, brown sediment at the Descemet membrane of the bilateral limbus cornea, exhibiting characteristics similar to those of KF ring. Then, the patient was referred to the Department of Neurology and diagnosed with asymptomatic WD. During the next 5 years of follow-up, the patient has worn RGP lenses, routinely taken drugs that inhibit copper absorption and promote copper excretion, and maintained a low-copper diet. He has never exhibited obvious systemic symptoms associated with WD, such as neurological, mental, or hepatic dysfunction, and the color of the KF ring has grown obviously lighter. Moreover, the morphology of the cornea has stabilized."
