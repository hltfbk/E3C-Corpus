  "text": "We present a case of Ekbom syndrome associated with recurrent depressive disorder in an elderly patient. The patient presented with tactile hallucinations of insects crawling just under her skin. These hallucinations resolved with Mirtazepine and electroconvulsive therapy treatment in the absence of an antipsychotic pharmacological agent."
