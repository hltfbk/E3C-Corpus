  "text": "The subject of this case report is a 6-month-old boy who presented with what appeared to be severe bilateral congenital hallux valgus. However, an MRI was suggestive of preaxial polydactyly without a supernumerary digit. At 26 months of age, clinical follow-up demonstrated that the deformity had improved and the patient was doing well clinically without intervention."
