  "text": "We present the case of a 39-year-old Greek woman, with no significant medical history, who was diagnosed incidentally with an enormous splenic hamartoma on computed tomography, finally confirmed by surgery and histopathology. Hamartomas are benign lesions, and it is important to differentiate them from malignancy."
