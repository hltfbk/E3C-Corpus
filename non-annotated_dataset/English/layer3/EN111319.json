  "text": "In this article, we present four patients with thyroglossal duct cyst and papillary thyroid cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer was located into the thyroglossal duct cyst (thyroglossal duct carcinoma) in two patients and two patients had thyroglossal duct cyst with thyroid carcinoma in thyroid tissue. Cervical lymph nodes were involved in one of the three patients. Sistrunk procedure and total thyroidectomy were performed for all. The thyroid lobes were not involved in patients with thyroid duct cyst carcinoma. Tumor or thyroglossal duct cyst recurrence did not occur in any of the patients in follow-up."
