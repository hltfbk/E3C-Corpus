  "text": "We report a patient of Yemenite descent who developed West Nile virus-encephalitis and poliomyelitis two weeks following treatment with rituximab for B cell lymphoma, and delayed encephalitis with ascending demyelinating polyneuropathy 6Â months later. Diagnosis of the first episode was based on a high West Nile virus copy number in the blood polymerase chain reaction. During the second episode the patient developed encephalitis and flaccid asymmetric quadriparesis, accompanied by high IgM anti-West Nile virus titers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid."
