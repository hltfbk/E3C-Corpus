  "text": "A 48-year-old man was admitted with the complaints of worsening back pain, palpitation, headache and sweating. He denied any trauma or weakness in his extremities. On physical examination he had point tenderness in his thoracic vertebrae and blood pressure 185/84 mm Hg. The patient had a history of a retroperitoneal paraganglioma that was discovered by chance at the age of 43 as an abdominal mass. No family history of paraganglioma was detected. The lesion was completely resected through laparotomy and the patient was found to be disease-free at follow-ups. When admitted to our hospital, laboratory tests revealed elevated serum normetanephrine and norepinephrine. CT scan revealed a lytic lesion involving the T4 vertebral body. On MRI, a compression fracture of the vertebral body with small epidural component was depicted. The supposed spinal metastatic functional paraganglioma was confirmed by computed tomography guided needle biopsy. The histologic and immunohistochemical assays revealed a paraganglioma. The patient displayed significant improvement in pain after radiosurgical treatment. Also, the patient underwent somatostatin analogs therapy and showed symptomatic and biochemical improvement as well. However, MRI revealed small new lesions in lumbar spine 6 months later. Treatment with combination chemotherapy for the management of the disease is now under discussion by a multidisciplinary team."
