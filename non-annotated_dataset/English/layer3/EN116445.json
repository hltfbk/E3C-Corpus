  "text": "A 38-year-old man, who had undergone surgery for glaucoma 2Â years ago previously, presented with redness, discomfort, and mucopurulent discharge in the right eye. A 9-0 silk suture had been left on the conjunctiva. A strain of P. aeruginosa was isolated from a culture obtained from the suture, and the patient was therefore diagnosed with suture-related conjunctivitis caused by P. aeruginosa. The conjunctivitis was cured by the application of an antimicrobial ophthalmic solution and removal of the suture. We used PFGE to survey of the indoor and outdoor environments around the patient's house and office in order to elucidate the route of transmission of the infection. Three strains of P. aeruginosa were isolated from the patient's indoor environment, and the isolate obtained from the patient's bathroom was identical to that from the suture."
