  "text": "A 73 year old male Caucasian patient presented with clinical signs indicative of bacterial meningitis. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures yielded beta-hemolytic, catalase-negative cocci. The strain was identified as Streptococcus zooepidemicus. The patient was likely infected by contact with a sick horse. Under antibiotic treatment, his general condition improved rapidly. Early after hospital admission, however, he began seeing a black spot in his left eye's central visual field. An ophthalmological examination revealed signs of endogenous endophthalmitis and so the patient underwent vitrectomy. Despite treatment, the visual acuity of his left eye remained severely impaired. He showed no further neurological deficits at hospital discharge."
