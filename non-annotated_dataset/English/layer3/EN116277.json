  "text": "A 30-year-old female was admitted to the general medicine ward with 1 month history of gradual onset swelling and pain in the left leg. The left calf diameter was 5 cm greater than the right. Doppler of the lower limbs revealed thrombosis in the left popliteal vein. Patient's coagulation profile revealed a normal prothrombin time of 12 sec, activated partial thromboplastin time of 30 sec, positive D-dimer, negative protein C and protein S and normal titres of antinuclear antibodies. Echocardiography showed an ejection fraction of 52 percent. Endocrinology consultation was sought in view of clinical suspicion of hypothyroidism. Endocrinology review revealed a significant past history of primary postpartum hemorrhage, lactation failure and secondary amenorrhea since the delivery of the last child 6 years back. She had clinical features of growth hormone, thyroid hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency. Hormonal analysis showed features of central hypothyroidism, secondary adrenal insufficiency and growth hormone deficiency which was subsequently confirmed by insulin tolerance test."
