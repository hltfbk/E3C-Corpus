  "text": "The patient was a 25-year-old Chinese woman with a missed miscarriage in a cesarean scar pregnancy. Curettage was performed under ultrasound monitoring. A uterine artery pseudoaneurysm measuring 71 × 44 × 39 mm was detected the next day by Doppler ultrasonography. While waiting for admittance to an advanced institution to undergo embolization treatment, the pseudoaneurysm ruptured spontaneously. The subsequent severe hemorrhage necessitated hysterectomy."
