  "text": "She was a 47 year old woman. She had no particular pathological history. She consulted for a parotid swelling evolving for 2 years, gradually increasing in size. A rapid increase in size of the swelling has been noted for 3 months. Physical examination found a left parotid mass of 15cm long axis, firm, with a bumpy surface and peeling off the ear lobule. However, the skin next to the swelling was healthy. There was no facial asymmetry, no lockjaw and no palpable cervical lymphadenopathies. The ostium of the Stenon duct were free with an issue of clear saliva. The parotid MRI objectified a left parotid mass, with heterogeneous signal (hyposignal T1 and hypersignal T2 and in diffusion sequences).This mass measured 15cm in large diameter and it was located in the superficial lobe of the parotid. It remained distant from the vascular axis. No cervical lymphadenopathy was identified in this exam. A FNAC was carried out concluding with a pleomorphic adenoma. The patient had a total parotidectomy with a pleomorphic adenoma on extemporaneous examination. Intraoperatively, the skin was intact. The tumor was located in the superficial lobe of the parotid. A simple skin suture was performed without using a flap. Histological examination revealed a sarcomatoid carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. Indeed the malignant componant was made of tubes and nests of tumors cells. The tubes were lined with an outer rim of myoepithelial cells and inner, dark ductal cells with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and round, bland nuclei. On some areas, the tumor was formed by spindle cells which showed mild to marked nuclear atypia with frequent mitosis. Immunohistochemically, epithelial cells were positive with AE1/AE3, cytokeratin7 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Myoepithelial cells expressed myoepithelial markers (PS100 and P63). Spindle cells were negative with PS100, smooth muscle actin, p63 and were focally positive with AE1/AE3. The patient had a surgery for the second time. We performed selective lymph node dissection carrying out the sectors I, II and III. The lymphadenopathies were non-metastatic and the radiological examinations didn't reveal any metastases. Then, the patient had a radiotherapy. The patient evolved well after treatment. We didn't notice any recurrence after 7 months of surveillance."
