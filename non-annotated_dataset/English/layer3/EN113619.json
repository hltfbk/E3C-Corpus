  "text": "We report the case of a 67-year-old male who fell while skiing and suffered a bilateral anterior shoulder dislocation associated with a four-part proximal humerus fracture on the left side and an osseous avulsion of the rotator cuff, a Pulley lesion, and a Hill-Sachs lesion on the right side. In addition, we searched the PubMed database using the terms \"bilateral shoulder dislocation\" and also \"bilateral glenohumeral dislocation\". All retrieved matches were browsed for reports of bilateral anterior shoulder dislocations in patients aged 40 years or older. We identified and analyzed 35 case reports, including our own, regarding 20 male and 15 female patients with an average age of 58.9 years (female: 59.2 years, male: 58.6 years)."
