  "text": "A 43-year-old man with colonic lymphangioma presented with a 7-month history of abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Computed tomography showed a cystic mass lesion at the distal descending colon. Colonoscopy revealed a smooth, polypoid mass, initially thought as an inverting diverticulum. He underwent laparoscopic high anterior resection. The pathological analysis revealed the descending colon mass to be a lymphangioma with no evidence of diverticulosis."
