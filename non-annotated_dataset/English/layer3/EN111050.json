  "text": "A 7-month-old girl, diagnosed with dextrocardia, congenitally corrected transposition of the great artery [situs solitus, L-loop, and L-transposition], ventricular septal defect, infundibular and pulmonary valvular stenosis, and straddling of the tricuspid valve, was considered as a candidate for the Fontan procedure. She had undergone Blalock-Taussig shunt, and epicardial univentricular pacemaker implantation for persistent complete atrioventricular block. She underwent a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt concomitant with ventricular lead translocation from the morphological left ventricle to the morphological right ventricle. After discharge, ventricular dyssynchrony was noted and cardiac failure persisted. She was converted to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) at 13 months of age. Two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging was used by cardiologists to determine the most suitable pacing site. CRT rapidly corrected the heart failure; thus, she underwent the Fontan procedure after 1.5 years. Five years have passed since the cardiac resynchronization therapy; her interventricular synchrony is maintained well and the level of brain natriuretic peptide remains within normal range."
