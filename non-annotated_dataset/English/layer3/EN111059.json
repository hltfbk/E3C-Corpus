  "text": "A 51-year-old man underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy for pT3(AD)N3M0 adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. One year after surgery, he presented with a rapidly growing tumor on the right thoracic wall. Contrast computed tomography demonstrated an enhancing tumor with uptake on positron emission tomography. We performed resection of the thoracic wall, including the skin and subcutis. The pathologic diagnosis was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, consistent with metastasis of esophageal origin."
