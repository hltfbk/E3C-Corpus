  "text": "A 30-year-old laborer suffered an injury resulting in necrosis of the distal phalanx and soft-tissue defect of the proximal phalanx. After amputation, the proximal phalanx was covered with a reverse EDB flap. PPP analysis involved a 4-m-long platform system (P-Walk) and was conducted 3- and 12-month post-surgery. Walking velocity and the single-support phase on the affected limb had increased markedly after 12 months. After 12 months, the PPP of the first metatarsal head was greater than on the unaffected side, and the cadence and single-leg support rate were equal to the unaffected side."
