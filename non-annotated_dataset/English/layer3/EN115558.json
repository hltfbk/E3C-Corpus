  "text": "A 56-year-old man presented after a left orchiectomy for an undescended left testicle. Pathologic examination identified a monodermal teratoma composed of thyroid parenchyma and associated with a 1.7-cm papillary thyroid carcinoma. Further evaluation showed a pulmonary mass on a chest CT scan. Total thyroidectomy revealed a 0.5-mm focus of papillary thyroid cancer, and removal of the lung mass confirmed metastatic papillary thyroid cancer. Array-comparative genomic hybridization of both tumors showed trisomy 17 in the struma testes and the lung metastasis. The patient responded well to radioactive iodine ablation and has no evidence of cancer 3 years later."
