  "text": "A 69-year-old man with pre-known situs inversus totalis and a long history of coronary artery\ndisease with multiple interventions and stent-implantations presented to our department suffering from episodes of\nchest pain under exercise. A coronary angiogram showed a completely occluded right coronary artery in the area of a\ndrug-eluting stent which had been implanted eight years before. We found collaterals from the left coronary artery\nsystem and signs of calcification, so the lesion was classified as chronic total occlusion and the recanalization using an antegrade wire escalation technique successfully performed."
