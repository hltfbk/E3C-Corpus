  "text": "A 20-year-old woman with bilateral high myopia (-6D) and a documented normal prior retinal examination presented with visual loss in the right eye 2 months following confirmed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive mononucleosis. Ophthalmoscopic examination showed completely unilateral placoid lesions of variable age. The left eye was unaffected. Fluorescein angiography revealed active leakage, especially in the parafovea. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) demonstrated sub-retinal pigment epithelial nodular deposits, some of which were confluent with overlying intra-retinal fluid and indistinct margins. Upon treatment with the immunosuppressant azathioprine there was significant resolution of the lesions in her right eye along with improvement in vision."
