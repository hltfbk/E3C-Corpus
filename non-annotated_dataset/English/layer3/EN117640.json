  "text": "We present the case of a 54-year-old Italian Caucasian woman in surgical menopause with a history of ovarian endometriosis, who underwent voluntary hormone replacement therapy for seven years. She developed postrenal renal failure due to bilateral compression of the pelvic ureteral tract caused by two large, deeply infiltrating endometriotic nodules with no pelvic pain. She underwent operative laparoscopy with adhesiolysis of enteroenteric adhesions and excision of the endometriotic nodules encompassing the juxtavesical tract of the ureters, without obtaining improvement of renal failure."
