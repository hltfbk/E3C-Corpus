  "text": "A 53-year-old woman of African descent was referred to a tertiary care endocrinology clinic for treatment of severe insulin resistance, treatment-resistant hypertension and dyslipidemia. After all known lipodystrophy-causing mutations were excluded by DNA sequencing, the patient was found to have triple X syndrome after an initial investigation into copy number variation using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray. The patient also had a previously unobserved duplication of 415 kilobases of chromosome 5q33.2. This is the first case report of a patient with lipodystrophy who also had triple X syndrome."
