  "text": "A 27-year-old Javanese man presented borderline intellectual functioning and striking dysmorphisms. A clinical diagnosis of Apert syndrome was previously made based on these clinical features. Furthermore, POSSUM software was used before molecular analysis and the result showed suspected Apert syndrome with a cut-off point of 14. Molecular genetic analysis of FGFR2, targeting exon 7, was performed by direct sequencing. In this patient, a missense mutation c.755C>G was detected, changing a serine into a tryptophan (p.Ser252Trp)."
