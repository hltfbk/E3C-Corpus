  "text": "A 56 year old Caucasian male was evaluated for abdominal and pelvic pain for 4 weeks complicated by acute urinary retention. Radiological evaluation showed him to have recto-sigmoid and cecal mass. Endoscopic examination and biopsies did not reveal a definite diagnosis. Computerized tomography guided biopsy of the mass showed fungal elements consistent with gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis. He was treated with Itraconazole for 12 months with very good clinical and radiological response."
