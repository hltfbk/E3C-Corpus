  "text": "An 84-year-old man presented with an ulcerated firm tumour on the dorsum of his right hand. A diagnostic biopsy confirmed the diagnosis SCC. Imaging suggested an involvement of the tendons of digits 3 and 4. A diagnostic ultrasound suggested a loco-regional axillary lymph node metastasis. After discussion in the interdisciplinary tumour board, amputation of the affected digits followed by lymph node excision was recommended."
