  "text": "Herein, we present three cases (two female; 1 male; and age range 65-years) of combined fractures involving the odontoid and unilateral superior articular processes of the axis, with a mean follow-up period of 17 months. Two patients were treated surgically, while one patient was treated non-surgically. In the present cases, two new findings were obtained regarding the mechanism of injury. First, both clockwise and counterclockwise rotated positions result in such fractures. Second, a comminuted-type fracture of the superior articular process of the axis was observed. Neck pain, limitations in the range of motion of the neck, and torticollis remained after treatment in non-surgical cases, while there were no such symptoms in surgical cases."
