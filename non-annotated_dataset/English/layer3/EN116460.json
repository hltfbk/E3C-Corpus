  "text": "A 2 year old Tunisian child presented with chronic thrombopenic purpura which failed to respond to corticosteroids. Hemolytic anemia with schistocytes, occurred ten months later, with no previous history of diarrhea or any neurological abnormality. Renal function and coagulation screening tests were normal. The count of platelet improved after fresh frozen infusion (FFP). Extensive investigations revealed a severe deficiency of ADAMTS 13 activity (level< 5%). Gene sequencing identified mutation in exon 18 of ADAMTS 13 gene. Prophylactic regimen with regular infusions of FFP was associated to favorable outcome."
