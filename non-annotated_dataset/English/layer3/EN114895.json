  "text": "Four black African children, between the ages of 4 and 8 years presenting between 1 and 20 months post-efavirenz initiation, are described. Cerebellar dysfunction, generalised seizures and absence seizures were the range of presenting abnormalities. Plasma efavirenz levels ranged from 20-60 mg/L, 5-15 times the upper limit of the suggested reference range. All abnormal central nervous system manifestations abated after efavirenz discontinuation."
