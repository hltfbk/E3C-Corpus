  "text": "A 21-year-old female reporting intermittent pain at the upper left side, multiple restorations, no trauma history, and having received orthodontic treatment was studied. Localized erythematous swelling was noted at the buccal interdental papilla between the left maxillary first molar and second premolar. The diseased pulp and tissue in resorption were removed and the root canal system including the defect were sealed using gutta percha/AH Plus and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). At the one-year recall, the tooth showed no symptoms and responded normally to percussion and palpation. The surrounding periodontium exhibited a normal color and the probing depth was normal. Radiographic examination showed a restoration of crestal alveolar bone and good adaption to MTA."
