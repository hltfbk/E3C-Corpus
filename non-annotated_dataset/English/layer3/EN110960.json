  "text": "A 50-year-old man, with a history of hypertension, presented to the Orthopedic Department of our hospital for non-traumatic acute left knee pain and swelling associated with a warmth sensation 14 mo after total knee arthroplasty. Investigations (ultrasound, aspiration, and arthroscopy) and managements (non-surgical, arthroscopy and open exploration) were performed, and the clinical effects of these interventions were analyzed separately. Clinical evidence indicates that the cause of this case was rupture of a pseudoaneurysm of the medial superior genicular artery."
