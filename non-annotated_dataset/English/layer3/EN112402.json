  "text": "We are presenting a 42-year-old patient with two timed removals of enlarged inguinal lymph nodes within one year, as the subsequent histological examination identified histopathological data for metastasis of melanoma. BRAF testing was positive for BRAF mutation. Within the anamnesis, it was further clear that the patient had an irritated melanocytic lesion in the lateral right thigh area, which over the time disappeared and shortly after that, the enlargement of locoregional lymph nodes has been noted."
