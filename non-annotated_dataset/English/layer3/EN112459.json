  "text": "We report a case of a 59-year-old Lebanese woman with metastatic pancreatic cancer who received FOLFIRINOX therapy and developed severe 5-fluorouracil toxicity after a single cycle. The entire DPYD gene was sequenced, and the patient was found to be heterozygous for three different polymorphisms that have reportedly been associated with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency."
