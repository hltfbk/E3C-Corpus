  "text": "We report the case of a 20-year-old African man who presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of diffuse abdominal pain, which began in his left iliac region and hypogastrium. After examination, we initiated a surgical exploration for peritonitis. We discovered a situs inversus at the left side of his liver, and his appendix was perforated in its middle third. A complementary post-operative thoracic and abdominal tomodensitometry revealed a situs inversus totalis."
