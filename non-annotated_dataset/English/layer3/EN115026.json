  "text": "Our patient was a 41-year-old Japanese woman who complained of stiffness of her right nipple with abnormal discharge. Local resection of the tumor was performed. The pathological diagnosis was syringomatous adenoma of the nipple, and the resection margin was found to be positive. Accordingly, additional resection was recommended, but our patient did not allow another operation. After 1.5 years of careful follow-up, no local recurrence or distant metastasis has been observed."
