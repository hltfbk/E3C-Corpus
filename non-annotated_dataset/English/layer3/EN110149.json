  "text": "A 30-year-old African man with sickle cell trait (AS) developed ischaemic priapism in 1981. He had cavernoso-spongiosal shunt with complete detumescence. However, he developed urethro-cutaneous fistula in the early post-operative period which was repaired after six months with Devine-Horton urethroplasty technique. He was subsequently lost to follow-up. Thirty-one years later, he was referred back to the same hospital where he previously had his shunt created by his family physician. The referral followed the finding of a bladder stone in a Pelvic X-ray done when he complained of recurrent pelvic and perineal pains. On further evaluation, he described three decades-long history of bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and he also had erectile dysfunction \\(ED) often improvising with digital support for successful vaginal penetration. This resulted in a recurrent acrimonious relationship with his spouse due to unsatisfying sexual intercourse. He was however able to father eight children during this period despite the ED. His International prostate symptom score (IPSS) was 18 and International index of erectile function-5 (IIEF-5) score was 12. Physical examination revealed meatal stenosis, a 5cm ventral midline distal penile scar of prior penile surgery and distal penile urethral induration. Prostate examination revealed no enlargement. A diagnosis of Postpriapism erectile dysfunction and shunt-related urethral stricture was made. He had abdominopelvic ultrasound done which showed no upper urinary tract abnormality, prostate volume of 30 mLs and a 3.5cm echogenic oval structure in the bladder casting an acoustic shadow. Retrograde urethrogram revealed irregularity and some narrowing in the distal-penile urethra. His Prostate specific antigen was 1.8ng/mL and serum electrolytes were within normal limits. He had urethrocystoscopy done after meatal dilatation and findings were narrowing, scarring and fibrosis in the distal-penile urethra at the site of the previous cavernoso-spongiosal shunt. Urethrocystoscopy also revealed a non-obstructing prostate, two bladder stones, the larger of which was approximately 3.5cm. The distal urethral stricture was easily dilated and cystolapaxy carried out. He declined shunt reversal. He was discharged on the third day and later commenced on oral Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors for the ED (Tabs Tadalafil 10mg on-demand). At one-year follow-up the LUTS had improved significantly (IPSS = 7), erectile function also improved to mild (IEFF Score of 20) and he was having more satisfying sexual intercourse than he had in the previous three decades."
