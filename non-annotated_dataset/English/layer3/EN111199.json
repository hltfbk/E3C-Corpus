  "text": "We recently experienced a very rare case of a 69-year-old man who had recurrent early and late ScTs with somewhat differing pathomechanisms as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). For the late ScT, OCT identified a scaffold dismantling in the same place that a peri-strut low intensity area (PLIA) was observed in the previous OCT finding."
