  "text": "Patient 1, a 38-year-old man with a history of congenital hepatitis B infection and hypospadias, was brought to our emergency department with complaints of cyanosis, cough, and edema of his limbs. He was clinically diagnosed as hyposplenic with overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and was administered antibiotics and catecholaminergic therapy but died 2 h after admission. Patient 2, a 63-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes, was brought to our emergency department one month after admission of Patient 1. She was diagnosed as asplenic with overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis. History-taking revealed that she was the mother of Patient 1 and the two had lived in the same household. She was admitted to the intensive care unit and was rapidly provided antibiotics and catecholaminergic intervention but died one day after admission."
