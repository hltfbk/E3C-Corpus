  "text": "We present a case of TTE accompanied by persistent MÃ¼llerian duct structures (PMDS) that had been discovered incidentally during inguinal exploration of a 26-day-old boy who presented with an incarcerated congenital inguinal hernia on the right side and left cryptochidism on the left side. The pathogenesis, approach and proposed management of TTE are discussed."
