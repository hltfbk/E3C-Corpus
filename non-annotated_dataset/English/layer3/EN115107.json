  "text": "A case of a nonimmunocompromised female patient with Mycobacterium gordonae-induced humidifier lung is described. She spontaneously recovered after discontinuing ultrasonic humidifier use. When subjected to a provocation test, she demonstrated acute respiratory distress with signs and symptoms, consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Before and after the provocation test, water in the humidifier reservoir revealed only Mycobacterium gordonae by the microbiologic analyses."
