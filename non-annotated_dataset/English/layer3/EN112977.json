  "text": "Our patient was a 15-year-old Han Chinese boy presenting with fever, edema, and gradually increasing abdominal girth. A physical examination revealed obvious hypoevolutism and hepatomegaly, and laboratory tests and imaging examinations showed severe pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, infection, and moderate anemia. A final diagnosis of Gaucher disease was confirmed after examining the splenic pathological section derived from a splenectomy performed 6 years ago. His recovery improved after receiving anti-infection, diuresis, blood transfusion, and hepatoprotection and so on. However, enzyme replacement therapy was not adopted by our patient because his family could not afford it."
