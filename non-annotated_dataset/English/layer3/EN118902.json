  "text": "We present the case of an 88-year-old man with dysphagia and weight loss. Initial investigation with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was inconclusive. A diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis as a cause for dysphagia was eventually made using video fluoroscopy. This showed a bony prominence impeding swallow at the level of C3. The patient was unfit for surgical management so a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was inserted for feeding."
