  "text": "A 66-year-old Japanese man with end-stage renal disease was admitted to our hospital for an operation for cervical canal stenosis. After the operation under general anesthesia, during which tracheal intubation and nasogastric tube insertion were performed, he developed low back pain. During a second hospitalization, computed tomography revealed osteolysis of the lumbar endplates of L2 and L3, swelling of the intervertebral disk of L2/L3, and swelling of the left psoas major muscle. Percutaneous drainage of the intervertebral disc was performed, and the culture of the aspirate grew Actinomyces israelii. Based on the susceptibility, ampicillin was administered but his condition did not improve. We changed the antibiotics to ampicillin-sulbactam for coverage of unidentified oral commensals, and his symptoms and signs finally improved."
