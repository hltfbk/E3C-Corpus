  "text": "The patient was a 62-year-old man who had been receiving immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus since undergoing a liver transplant 15 years prior. He reported that he had experienced abdominal discomfort and anorexia 1 month prior to the current admission. Abdominal pelvic computed tomography (CT) revealed peritoneal and omental mass-like lesions without bowel obstruction. Ultrasonography-guided biopsy was performed, and he was histologically diagnosed with EBV-negative DLBCL. Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT depicted peritoneum and omentum involvement only, without any lymphadenopathy or organ masses, including in the gastrointestinal tract. Six cycles of chemotherapy with a \"R-CHOP\" regimen (rituximab-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) were administered, and PET-CT performed thereafter indicated complete remission."
