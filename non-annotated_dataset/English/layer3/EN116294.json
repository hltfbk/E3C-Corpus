  "text": "In this case report we describe a 55-year-old Caucasian man with a right hemispheric ischemic syndrome who presented in time but who had multiple contraindications against systemic thrombolysis. He was then treated with mechanical recanalization and recovered. On discharge from the hospital he had only a slight left-sided facial paresis and discrete impairment of motion smoothness in his left hand."
