  "text": "The patient was a 53-year-old Japanese woman that we previously reported as having severe hepatobiliary adverse effects related to ceritinib therapy. Laboratory data, CT and MRI were obtained at each time point. IL-18 was evaluated by ELISA method at each time point. Immunochemical staining of liver tissue was performed as a standard protocol using antibodies against IL-18. Our records showed that the levels of serum IL-18 increased from the early stage of hepatobiliary adverse effects related to the treatment with ceritinib and were became worse with an increase in hepatobiliary enzymes and the progression of imaging abnormalities in the bile duct. Furthermore, IL-18 positive cells were detected in the inflammatory sites around the interlobular bile duct of the liver tissue."
