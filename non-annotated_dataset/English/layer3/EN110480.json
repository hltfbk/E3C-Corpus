  "text": "An eleven year old boy from rural South India was referred to our centre by an ophthalmologist for sudden onset diplopia. The diplopia was particularly complained when looking towards the left side. He also complained blurring of vision and frequent eye blinking in both eyes. There was no headache, vomiting, speech disturbance, seizures or weakness of limbs. There was history of trivial trauma to head while playing in the school, three weeks ago. There was no external injury. He developed some restriction of neck movements following the incident which improved subsequently. His birth history and developmental history were unremarkable. His immunization was appropriate for age. On examination, he weighed 32.6 kilograms. His height was 139cm, head circumference, 52cm and body mass index was 17.1kg/m 2. His vital signs were normal. Central nervous system examination revealed normal higher mental functions, grade 3 papilledema bilaterally, left lateral rectus palsy, nystagmus on left lateral gaze and neck stiffness. Other cranial nerves, motor and sensory system were normal. There were no cerebellar signs and the gait was normal. He was admitted in the intensive care unit for further evaluation and monitoring. An initial diagnosis of benign intracranial hypertension was considered and he was started on anti-cerebral edema measures pending neuroimaging. His complete blood count, electrolytes, renal and hepatic function tests were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a well-defined lesion measuring 1.6cm x 1.5cm x 1.6cm in the pineal region. The pineal gland was not visualized separately. The lesion was hyper intense on T1 and T2 weighted images with no post-contrast enhancement. It also showed intense diffusion restriction. The lesion was causing compression of superior colliculus on its antero-inferior aspect and posteromedial portions of both thalami on either side with obstruction to the third ventricular outflow leading to mild obstructive hydrocephalus. Radiologists opined the possibilities of pineal cyst with hemorrhage or pineal epidermoid cyst. He underwent excision biopsy through Krause's approach. The postoperative MRI showed complete removal of cyst. Histopathology examination confirmed pineal epidermoid cyst. In the postoperative period, he had ataxia and upgaze palsy, which resolved in due course. The left lateral rectus palsy had improved. He recovered completely and discharged from the hospital on post-operative day 7 without any neurological deficits. Follow up at the end of one month and three months, he was symptom free and his neurological examination was normal."
