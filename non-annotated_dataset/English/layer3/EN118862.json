  "text": "A 62-year old male, ex smoker, with a history of chronic cough was examined with helical CT tomography and an air filled lesion was demonstrated at the right paratracheal region at the thoracic inlet. A narrow connection to trachea lumen was also visible, a critical element to establish the diagnosis of ttracheal diverticulosis."
