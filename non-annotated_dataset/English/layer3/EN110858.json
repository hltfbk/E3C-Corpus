  "text": "A 32-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with complaints of cognitive decline, diplopia, and walking instability during the previous 6 mo. He developed dysarthria, difficulty swallowing, and involuntary shaking of his head, neck, and limbs during the month prior to presentation. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed symmetrical abnormal signals in the pons, midbrain, and bilateral basal ganglia, and inflammatory demyelination was considered. The diagnosis of syphilis was confirmed based on the syphilis diagnosis test and the syphilis rapid test. He was given anti-syphilis treatment, but the above symptoms gradually worsened. Anti-NMDAR antibody was positive in cerebrospinal fluid but was negative in serum. Due to the cerebrospinal fluid findings, anti-NMDAR encephalitis was a consideration. According to the patient's weight, he was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g QD for 5 d, with the dose gradually decreased for 6 mo, and immunoglobulin 25 g QD for 5 d; his symptoms improved after treatment."
