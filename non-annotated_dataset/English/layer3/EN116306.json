  "text": "A 5-year-old girl was admitted to the emergency room with abdominal pain and vomit for two days. Ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a giant solid-cystic abdominal mass, preferring diagnosis of teratoma. A large neoplasm in the mesentery of the small bowel was found in the surgical exploration, which was then resected with the partial bowel. A brown honeycomb mass in size 16 cm×8 cm×5 cm was observed to adhere to the small bowel, and diagnosed as hemangioma of cavernous and venous mixed type in final pathology."
