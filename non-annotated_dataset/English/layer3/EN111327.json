  "text": "We report a patient who developed diabetes with a 1.58-Mb Chr17q12 microdeletion and BLK gene c.211G > A mutation using the cytoscan high-density array and whole-exome sequencing analysis. The patient received the surgery at five days after birth for the duodenal atresia and had normal growth postoperatively. Mild elevated liver enzymes were found along with the normal renal function. Quantitative analysis of β-cell function markers, including fasting insulin (< 0.2 mIU/L), fasting C-peptide (0.02 μg/L), postprandial-2 h insulin (< 0.2 mIU/L), and postprandial-2 h C-peptide (0.03 μg/L) suggested a severe loss of insulin secreting capacity. Meanwhile, islet autoantibodies (GADA, IA-2, ICA, and IAA) in the patient's blood appeared negative. Neither dysplasia in other tissues nor abnormality in development and behavior was found."
