  "text": "A 12-year-old boy presented with unicameral bone cyst in the body of talus, with fracture of the subchondral bone. Radiological evaluation suggested a simple bone cyst (SBC). Thereafter, posterior ankle arthroscopy was performed and the cyst was approached through posteriortalar process. Debridement of the cystic lesion was done along with curettage, sparing a thin rim of surrounding subchondral bone. The articular cartilage was found intact on both superior and inferior aspects. Subsequently, the defect was filled arthroscopically with cancellous bone graft harvested from the ipsilateral calcaneum through osteochondral autograft transfer system."
