  "text": "We describe the case of a 27-year-old white woman who had experienced an emergency caesarean delivery at 39 weeks for fetal distress with no postpartum complications. This is a report of the successful expectant management of a heterotopic scar pregnancy. The gestational sac implanted into the scar area was non-viable. The woman was treated expectantly and had a normal vaginal delivery at 37 weeks of gestation."
