  "text": "A 10-year-old boy complained of right lower quadrant abdominal pain and underwent an appendectomy under a diagnosis of acute appendicitis in previous hospital. The final diagnosis was appendiceal NET, so he was referred to our department for additional resection. The tumor was found in the base of the appendix and invasively reached the subserosal layer with obvious vascular invasion. His Ki-67 index was 1 to 2%, so we classified it as appendiceal NET G1 according to the WHO 2015 classification. We considered the possibility of a tumor remnant or lymph node metastasis, so we performed single-incision laparoscopy with D3 lymph node dissection. The pathological diagnosis revealed no tumor remnant but metastasis to one lymph node. He was discharged on the 9th postoperative day. There has been no recurrence at 3 years and 7 months after surgery."
