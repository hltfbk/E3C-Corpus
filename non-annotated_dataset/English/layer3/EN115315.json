  "text": "A 50-year-old man presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of dysuria. Histological examination revealed prostate cancer, which was classified as cT4 N0 M0, stage IV adenocarcinoma. Since the patient was at high risk, endocrine and radiation therapies were started. One year after starting radiation therapy, the patient developed bloody sputum. Chest radiography revealed a nodular shadow in his left lung (S5). Although 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed abnormal accumulation in the lesion, the cytological diagnosis was class IIIa, which did not yield a definitive diagnosis. Given that prostate specific antigen (PSA) was not elevated, a primary lung tumor was suspected, and thoracoscopic segmental resection of the lung was performed with lymph node dissection. The final pathological diagnosis was solitary lung metastasis from prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation and mediastinal lymph node metastasis. The specimen showed a mixed pattern of conventional prostatic and neuroendocrine carcinomas."
