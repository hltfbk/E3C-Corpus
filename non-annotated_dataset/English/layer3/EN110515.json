  "text": "A 57-year-old female patient underwent total thyroidectomy. Histopathology revealed a follicular thyroid carcinoma (pT1bNxMx). Four weeks later she received, with thyroid hormone withdrawal, 3.7 GBq of 131I as a treatment. At this time, the serum thyroglobulin level was 2.7 ng/mL, TSH was 73 ÂµIU/ml and antithyroglobulin antibody level was less than 20 IU/mL.\nFive days after the treatment, WBS showed mild uptake in the neck, representing thyroid remnants, and a large and a high heterogeneous radioiodine accumulation in the median lower abdomen and pelvis confirmed by Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT).\nAn ultrasound showed a right adnexal mass measuring 126 mm with a double tissue and cystic components with heterogeneous vascularization on color Doppler.\nThe patient underwent a hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy. Pathological examination found a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the right ovary."
