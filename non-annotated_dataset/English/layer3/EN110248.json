  "text": "A 60 year old female patient was admitted to Centre Hospitalier universite Ibn Rochd, Casablanca, Maroc, with two months of a localized left upper quadrant abdominal pain, dull aching nature and associated with occasional bouts of vomiting and a history of non-documented weight loss. She had past surgical history of transvaginal resection of uterine fibroid trans-vaginally “hysteroscopy resection of uterine fibroid” (no document). Abdominal examination revealed a palpable and tender intraabdominal mass in the left upper abdominal quadrant; it was about 11cm x 6 cm in its greatest diameter. The laboratory investigations including hematocrit, leukocytes, platelets, kidney function tests, electrolytes and liver function tests were within normal range. Abdominal-pelvic computer tomography imaging shows a retroperitoneal and well-defined cystic mass (11 x 10 x 8cm), with peripheral uptake of the contrast and anteriorly located in relation to the left kidney. The mass had no partitioning and forced back to the contra lateral side the intestinal loops in. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with the presumptive diagnosis of intra-abdominal hydatid cyst. The intraoperative findings revealed a large bulging cystic tumor arising from the retroperitoneal space posterolateral to the descending colon, inferior to the spleen and anterior to the left kidney and attached to the splenic flexure by a highly vascularized tissue band, giving the impression of a retroperitoneal sarcoma as shown in. Externally, it was grayish red and smooth with a row of adipose and fibrous tissue tags along one surface. The mass was dissected free and excised. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative recovery course and she was free of disease four months later. Grossly, the mass was grayish brown in color, soft and cystic with hemorrhagic area measuring 11cm x 6 cm. Cut section revealed solid homogenous grayish tumor with multiple small cystic areas and area of hemorrhage. Microscopic finding, showed small round to oval neoplastic cells with diffuse and trabecular patterns. The cells showed scanty cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei with nuclear grooves and Call-exner bodies. With this typical histopathological feature, a diagnosis of extrovarian GCT was made. The tumor was positive for inhibin and negative for EMA, confirming the diagnosis extraovarian GCT. Post-operative course was unremarkable and patient discharged on 6 th day. The histopathological studies with Immunohistochemistry analysis showed a diffuse adult type of a tumor of the granulosa with effraction of its capsule. The patient was called again for a planned second operation which consist hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy with hysterectomy, but she refused the operation and any other adjuvant treatment."
