  "text": "We present an unusual case of parkinsonism secondary to multiple brain metastases. A 57-year-old Caucasian man had recently been diagnosed with primary carcinoma of the colon and had multiple metastases in the lungs and liver. He subsequently developed bilateral symmetrical parkinsonism, and multiple brain tumors were detected by computed tomography scanning. The condition of our patient deteriorated rapidly, and he became akinetic and dependent for all activities of daily living. He was followed up and treated at home by our palliative care unit team and died two weeks after the onset of his neurologic symptoms."
