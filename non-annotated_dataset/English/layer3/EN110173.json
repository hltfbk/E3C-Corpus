  "text": "A 37-year-old male patient admitted to the emergency department with swelling of elbow, limitation of movement and pain after falling onto palm with elbow in extension. Patient's radiographs revealed displaced and angled radial neck fracture. The angle between radial neck and long axis was measured as 52 degrees. MRI was performed in order to evaluate possible accompanying ligament and soft tissue damage at elbow and its surrounding and chondral damage. No bony, soft tissue and chondral damage were detected on MRI. Only radial neck fracture was present in the patient. There upon surgery was planned. Closed reduction under general anesthesia was planned first. Reduction could not be achieved with twice closed reduction attempts; so closed reduction with intramedullary pinning was decided.\nOne K-wire, which can be used as a joystick, was inserted into radial head under fluoroscopic controlin the transverse plane to achieve reduction indirectly. Then cortex was reached following 1 cm skin incision over lateral radial distal metaphysis with great care taken not to injure the sensory branch of the radial nerve; a 3.2 drill is introduced to cortex to open a window. A T-handle was placed to approximately 30 ° angled, 1 cm distal end of a 2-millimeters thick, 25 cm long K-wire. K-wire was introduced over the entrance point under fluoroscopic control with concavity facing outside and elbow in extension and traction. K-wire was advanced into the proximal metaphyseal-diaphyseal region. Meantime joystick K-wire that was inserted to radial head in the transverse plane was removed. K-wire was advanced upwards, attached to metaphyseal residues of radial head and the wire was rotated 180 ° untilreduction was achieved. Mean while, the radial head was checked not to be drilled and cause chondral damage. Thus radial head at the end of the wire was allowed to return to the interior by being dragged. K-wire was stopped by lateral humeral condyle, which serves as a tampon, while advancing toward radial head. In this way, excessive correction was prevented. As the patient was adult, a second intramedullary 1.8-mm K-wire was inserted to achieve a more stable fixation.\nAbove elbow circular cast was applied for two weeks to complete elbow recovery. Then active movements were started. No strenuous exercise was given to patients. Radiological control was performed at intervals of three weeks. Bone healing could be visualized radiographically at third month. Intramedullary pin was removed from the patient under local anesthesia in the outpatient clinic after 4 weeks.Range of motion of the elbowjoint was 145 degrees for flexion, 90 degrees for supination and 90 degrees for pronation. Elbow joint was pain-free."
