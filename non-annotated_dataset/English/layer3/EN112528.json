  "text": "Our patient was a 40-year-old Caucasian woman with borderline personality disorder and active suicidal thoughts who was found unconscious after a massive drug consumption of slow-release clomipramine, lorazepam, and domperidone. On her arrival in the emergency room, endotracheal intubation was preformed to protect her airway, and a chest x-ray revealed multiple coffee grain-sized opaque masses in the stomach. She was treated with activated charcoal followed by two endoscopic gastric decontaminations 12 h apart in order to extract a massive gastric pharmacobezoar by manual removal of the tablets."
