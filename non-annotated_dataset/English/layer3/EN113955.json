  "text": "A 72-year-old Saudi Arabian woman presented with a solid, bone-containing breast mass that was diagnosed as primary osteosarcoma of the breast on biopsy. She had a history of untreated intraductal papilloma. Treatment was completed with a modified mastectomy after excluding extramammary metastases. However, she subsequently developed multiple recurrent lesions at the same site."
