  "text": "A 59-year-old woman had recurrence of serous ovarian adenocarcinoma in the vaginal stump, near the site of anastomosis from a rectal resection 18 months previously. We used a hybrid approach comprising conventional open laparotomy and TEA to accomplish sphincter preservation. In addition to sphincter preservation, TEA allowed for the creation of a \"terminal\" space, which was made by anterior dissection between the rectum and the vagina. We employed TEA to create an opening in the scar tissue along the sacrum, which was used as a \"guide\" for pelvic dissection to prevent nerve injury. After exteriorization of the tumor, bowel continuity was achieved by hand-sewn coloanal anastomosis with a protective diverting ileostomy. Pathological examination revealed no involvement of the surgical margins. The diverting ileostomy was taken down 8 months postoperatively."
