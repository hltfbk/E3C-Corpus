  "text": "We report the case of a 75-year-old Caucasian woman who had a high level of carcinoembryonic antigen, and who underwent computed tomography colonography. Our patient accidentally fell from a chair in the radiology department just before the examination, experiencing a right hip trauma. The examination was negative for colonic lesions but revealed the presence of some air bubbles in her right colon. Our patient remained asymptomatic throughout the procedure and afterwards; no intervention or treatment was necessary."
