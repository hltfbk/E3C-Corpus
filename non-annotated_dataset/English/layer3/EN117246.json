  "text": "A 49-year-old Thai man with underlying limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis presented with acute low-grade fever, progressive dyspnea and right pleuritic chest pain for five days. Our patient had pulmonary fibrosis with bronchiectasis of both lower lungs related to this underlying disease. He received only low-dose steroid therapy, without any immunosuppressant. A chest radiograph revealed right lung pneumothorax with cloudy yellow color pleural fluid. Cryptococcal pneumonia was diagnosed by positive identification of the cryptococcal antigen in the serum and pleural fluid. His symptoms improved after intercostal drainage and fluconazole therapy."
