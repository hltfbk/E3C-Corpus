  "text": "We report a six-week-old male infant who received a 5 ml intravenous infusion of breast milk. Within five minutes of administration the child developed tachycardia and tachypnea, accompanied by a sudden decrease in oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry to 69%. The infant received supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered for 48 hours. Vital signs returned to normal within a few hours. Neurological follow-up through 3 years did not reveal any neurodevelopmental abnormalities."
