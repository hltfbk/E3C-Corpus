  "text": "A 29-year-old Caucasian man complained of extreme fatigue, daytime sleepiness, shortness of breath on exertion, light-headedness and general weakness on standing. These symptoms began shortly after the surgical correction of an aortic coarctation and became progressively more debilitating, impairing any daily activity. An extensive work-up revealed postural tachycardia syndrome and a coexisting sleep-related breathing disorder, characterized as upper airway resistance syndrome."
