  "text": "A 15-month-old girl presented with persistent mild fever with a duration of 1 month, hepatomegaly, and low-density lesions in the right hepatic lobe on abdominal ultrasound and computer tomography. Pathological examination and serum antibody detection were performed to verify HP. The diagnosis of HP was established based on findings of Charcot-Leyden crystals on liver lesion biopsy and antibodies against paragonimus westermani detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After initiation of praziquantel (75 mg/kg/day for 3 days), all clinical findings promptly improved and the patient was discharged."
