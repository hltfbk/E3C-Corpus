  "text": "We report the case of a 5-year-old boy with a presumptive diagnosis of Crohn's disease with extraintestinal manifestations. Chronic granulomatous disease was suspected in this case after Serratia marcescens was isolated from a skin ulcer culture. Granulomas were confirmed on histology and chronic granulomatous disease was diagnosed."
