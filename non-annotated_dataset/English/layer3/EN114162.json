  "text": "A 43-year-old man with progressive dysphagia and diarrhea was referred to the teaching hospital. He had a history of recurrent duodenojejunal perforations despite the anti-secretory medication. Blood examinations revealed elevated serum gastrin, calcium, and parathyroid hormone. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy demonstrated a severe esophageal stricture, multiple gastroduodenal ulcer scars, and a duodenal submucosal tumor. Enhanced computed tomography showed multiple hypervascular tumors within the pancreas and duodenum, suggestive of MEN1. Genetic examination demonstrated a pathogenic MEN1 mutation. Repetitive endoscopic esophageal dilatation with intralesional corticosteroid injection, coupled with pancreatoduodenectomy were performed to improve the patient's symptoms and to treat pancreatic tumors. The histology of multiple tumors in the duodenum and pancreas were all consistent with neuroendocrine tumors. His hypergastrinemia subsided and he remained asymptomatic in his gastrointestinal tract after these treatments."
