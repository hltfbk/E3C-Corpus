  "text": "In this article, we describe a case of a 54-year-old female patient with large hepatic artery aneurysm which was incidentally founded. From symptoms, she had abdominal discomfort slightly worsening after meals, frequent pain in mesogastrium and reported some unexplained weight loss in the last few months. The lesion was detected by CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis."
