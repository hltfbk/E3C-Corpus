  "text": "A 65-year-old woman underwent right hepatectomy, extrahepatic duct resection, and portal vein resection, for gallbladder cancer. Although the patient had an uneventful postoperative course, computed tomography on postoperative day 6 showed a 6-mm pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery. Angiography revealed the pseudoaneurysm located on the bifurcation of the left hepatic artery to the segment 2 artery plus the segment 3 artery and 4 artery. Stent placement in the left hepatic artery was not feasible because the artery was too narrow, and coiling of the pseudoaneurysm was associated with a risk of occluding the left hepatic artery and inducing critical liver failure. Therefore, portal vein arterialization constructed by anastomosing the ileocecal artery and vein was performed prior to embolization of the pseudoaneurysm to maintain the oxygen level of the remnant liver, even if the left hepatic artery was accidentally occluded. The pseudoaneurysm was selectively embolized without occlusion of the left hepatic artery, and the postoperative laboratory data were within normal limits. Although uncontrollable ascites due to portal hypertension occurred, embolization of the ileocolic shunt rapidly resolved it. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 45."
