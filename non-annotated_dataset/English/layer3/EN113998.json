  "text": "A 73-year-old woman with a diagnosis of limb-girdle MD visited our department for recurrence of a huge tumor in her left thigh. She had undergone resection of a lipoma at the same site more than 20 years earlier. Imaging studies revealed a lipomatous tumor in her left thigh. We performed marginal resection including the adjacent muscles. Histological diagnosis was atypical lipomatous tumor. The postoperative course was uneventful, with no recurrence at 36 months of follow-up."
