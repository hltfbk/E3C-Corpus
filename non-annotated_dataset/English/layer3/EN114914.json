  "text": "This patient was a 37-year-old woman. She was admitted to our hospital for hypertension and bilateral limb weakness. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a mass in right renal sinus. It was initially considered a tumor of the renal pelvis. Further computed tomographic angiography (CTA) showed the mass to be located outside the renal pelvis. After adequate preoperative preparation (blood pressure control and serum potassium supplement), the patient underwent laparoscopic resection of retroperitoneal tumor. During the procedure, a soft tissue tumor 3.4*3.0Â cm(2) in size with a golden color was found in the right renal sinus. The final immunohistochemistry examination showed an ectopic adreocortical adenoma."
