  "text": "We report an 80Â year old female patient who developed a DLBCL with chronic inflammation in association to a metallic implant in the left knee. This lymphoma in contrast to the usually described DLBCL in the peri-prosthetic membrane was EBV negative by EBER in situ hybridization as well as by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)."
