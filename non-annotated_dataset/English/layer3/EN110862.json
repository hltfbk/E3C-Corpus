  "text": "We present a case of a 36-year-old man diagnosed in 2012 with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), then he was hospitalized in 2019 due to progressive symptoms of heart failure and significant weight loss over the previous four months. Based on clinical and laboratory findings a diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma was suspected and confirmed by bone marrow flow cytometry. There was no improvement in the results of laboratory tests and the patient's condition after immediate implementation of chemotherapy. Patient died on the fifth day of treatment."
