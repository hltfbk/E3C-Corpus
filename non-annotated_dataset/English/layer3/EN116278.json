  "text": "A 55 year old smoker male presented to the our outpatient clinic in 2004 with complaints of gradual onset increase in the size of hands and feet, bilateral knee pain, increased sweating and blurring of vision. Investigations uncovered diabetes mellitus by a casual blood glucose of 243 mg/dl and HbA1c of 8.5%. Growth hormone suppression test using 75 gram oral glucose showed a 60 minute growth hormone of 105 ng/ml. Magnetic resonance imaging of the sellar region showed a 12.0 mm Ã— 10.0 mm pituitary adenoma. The patient was planned for transsphenoidal tumor decompression. However, the patient was lost to follow up. Eight-years later, he presented in the emergency department of our institute with sudden onset headache, vomiting and decreased level of consciousness of one day duration. CT scan of the head with focus on the sella was suggestive of apoplexy which was later confirmed by the MRI of the sellar region."
