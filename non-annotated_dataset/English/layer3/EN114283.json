  "text": "A 54-year-old male presented with a gastric submucosal mass detected by endoscopic examination. Laparoscopic wedge resection was performed. Macroscopically, the 2.7 cm yellowish mass was located in the submucosa of the stomach. Microscopically, the tumor was well circumscribed and had a homogeneous acinar architecture. The tumor cells were small and had a minimal amount of cytoplasm. The nuclei of the tumor cells were round to oval with finely dispersed chromatin. The tumor cells were strongly positive for α1-antitrypsin, chymotrypsin, and α1-antichymotrypsin immunostaining, consistent with pancreatic exocrine differentiation. There was no clinical or radiologic evidence of primary pancreatic or head and neck tumors. After surgical resection of the tumor, there was no recurrence or metastasis during 33 months follow-up."
