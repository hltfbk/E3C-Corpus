  "text": "The present report describes the case of a 38-year-old patient whose radius was fractured in a car accident. A first surgery involved stabilizing the reduced fracture with a plate, but an infection developed, and the bone did not heal. 3 months later, a second surgery followed, involving placing an antibiotic-filled spacer. This did not cure the infection, so the spacer was replaced 3 months later, and a second antibiotic was added. The patient also began taking oral antibiotics. 6 months later, the patient underwent vascularized fibular grafting. However, the graft did not integrate, and a non-union developed. A year later, the non-union was treated by grafting autogenous bone from the iliac crest, equine bone substitute, and equine DBM, in conjunction with autologous BMC and platelet-rich plasma. At the 6-month follow-up, the bone structure appeared to be successfully reconstructed."
