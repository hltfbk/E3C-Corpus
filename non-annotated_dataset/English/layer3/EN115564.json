  "text": "Two cases of cutaneous TBC are reported. The first patient was 52-year-old woman with facial erythematous papulo-nodular lesions which had been developing for 4 months, and had previously been treated as acne rosacea, with partial response. Histopathological studies showed chronic granulomatous inflammation. TBC was suspected, so PCR was performed, which showed positive for M. tuberculosis. The second case was a 43-year-old woman with a facial rosaceiform plaque which began 6 months previously, and was treated as rosacea without any change for 5 months. Skin biopsy and PCR were positive for TBC. Both cases were treated using primary schedule for TBC, and both presented a favorable response."
