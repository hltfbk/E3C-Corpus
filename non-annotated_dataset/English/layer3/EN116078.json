  "text": "We reported a symptomatic, 83-year-old woman who presented with dynamic, high resting left ventricle (LV) mid-wall gradient without obvious septal hypertrophy or systolic anterior motion (SAM). Subsequent real-time (RT) three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated large, hypertrophic accessory papillary muscles squeezing mid-cavity of left ventricle producing dynamic pressure gradient during systole in the absence of left ventricular wall anomalies."
