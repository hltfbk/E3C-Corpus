  "text": "The patient was a 48-year-old woman who presented to our hospital with a one-month history of dysphagia. Upper endoscopy revealed an esophageal submucosal lesion that was completely removed by endoscopic submucosal dissection. Pathologic examination of the resected specimen secured the diagnosis of lymphangioma. A review of the PUBMED indexed literature in English with the key words of esophagus and lymphangioma was carried out and the results were discussed."
