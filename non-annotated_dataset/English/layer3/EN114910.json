  "text": "Here, we report the case of a 27-year-old woman diagnosed with Hashimoto's encephalitis (HE) who attempted suicide and infanticide by defenestration. As she presented risk factors for postpartum psychosis, she was treated principally with antipsychotics. Despite adequate treatment for psychosis, symptoms worsened and she developed catatonia. Complementary investigations showed elevated titres of anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (200 and 10 times, respectively, as compared to normal levels) and electroencephalography were suggestive of encephalopathy. In the presence of an otherwise unexplained neuropsychiatric condition, HE was suspected and oral prednisolone was introduced. Psychiatric symptoms improved dramatically within 72 h and the patient was still free of any symptom 3 years later."
