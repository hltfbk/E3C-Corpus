  "text": "A 21-year-old woman was admitted to our department for a giant hepatic tumor measuring 22 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm that completely replaced the left hepatic lobe. Her laboratory data only suggested mildly elevated liver function parameters and C-reactive protein levels. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed mixed density in the tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the tumor revealed a heterogeneous hypointensity on T1-weighed MR images and heterogeneous hyperintensity on T2-weighed MR images. On dynamic contrast CT and MRI scans, the tumor presented marked enhancement and the subcapsular feeding arteries were clearly visible in the arterial phase, with persistent enhancement in the portal and delayed phases. Moreover, the tumor capsule was especially prominent on T1-weighted MR images and showed marked enhancement in the delayed phase. Based on these imaging manifestations, the tumor was initially considered to be an HCA. Subsequently, the tumor was completely resected and pathologically diagnosed as an HCA."
