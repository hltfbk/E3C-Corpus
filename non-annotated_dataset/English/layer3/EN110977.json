  "text": "An 88-year-old woman underwent small bowel bypass surgery for postoperative ileus following rectal cancer resection. She developed a fever during total parenteral nutrition and was diagnosed with gram-positive cocci bacteremia of central venous catheter origin. The patient was referred to our department with chief complaints of ocular pain, hyperemia and decreased vision in the right eye, which had manifested during the febrile period. The initial examination revealed the visual acuity in her right eye to be finger counting and that in her left eye 0.2. The right eye showed a severe inflammatory reaction in the anterior chamber, fibrin deposition, and hypopyon. The fundus was difficult to visualize. Endogenous endophthalmitis due to bacteria was diagnosed. Surgical treatment was judged to be difficult based on the patient's poor general condition and mental status, and intravitreal injection of 0.1 ml of 1.25% povidone-iodine was performed on the same day. The inflammation rapidly diminished, and the hypopyon had disappeared 4 days after treatment. The fundus became visible 7 days after treatment and there was no recurrence of endophthalmitis findings. The visual acuity in her right eye recovered to that in the left eye (0.2)."
