  "text": "We describe the case of a 34-year old man presenting with hypercalcemia and symptomatic osteolytic bone lesions of vertebrae and ribs who was initially suspected as having a solid malignancy. Diagnostic work-up including peripheral blood examination, radiographic and nuclear studies could, however, not detect a primary tumor. Because of a mild thrombocytopenia and the lack of a primary focus, a bone marrow biopsy was performed leading to the diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome positive precursor B-ALL. After correction of the hypercalcemia with intravenous fluid administration, corticoids and bisphosphonates, the patient was treated according to the HOVON 100 protocol achieving complete molecular remission after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy."
