  "text": "We report a 24-year-old Chinese man with multiple gastric angiolipomas, with a positive stool occult blood examination. Endoscopic biopsy only showed nonspecific inflammation. Histological examination of the specimen by endoscopic snare resection showed that the tumor consisted of adipose tissues and blood vessels. We also performed a literature review. After the use of proton pump inhibitor, the fecal occult blood test was negative. Due to the difficulty of resecting multiple lesions in the stomach completely and the benign characteristics of angiolipoma, we chose to have regular upper gastrointestinal endoscopy evaluation of the lesion. No evidence of significant change in lesion size was detected after 3-years follow-up."
