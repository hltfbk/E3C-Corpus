  "text": "We present the case of a Caucasian woman who was 46-year-old when she first noted a mass in her right breast in 2015; she was initially diagnosed as having metaplastic breast carcinoma. Mastectomy and systemic chemotherapy were planned; however, after review of pathology at a referral center, the diagnosis was changed to dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. She was treated with 4â€‰months of neoadjuvant imatinib with adequate tumor shrinkage to perform breast conservation."
