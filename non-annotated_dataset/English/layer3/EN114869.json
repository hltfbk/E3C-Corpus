  "text": "A 37-year-old male sustained a right subdural hematoma after a mechanical fall while intoxicated. He presented initially with a Glasgow Coma Scale 15. Three days later, he exhibited acute neurological deterioration to Glasgow Coma Scale 4, requiring intubation and mannitol. Repeat scan demonstrated enlarging right subdural hematoma with worsening shift; brain stem hemorrhage was noted at pontomesencephalic junction. Patient was immediately taken for subdural hematoma evacuation. The following day, patient was able to sluggishly follow commands in all four extremities. He had a short stay for inpatient rehabilitation and underwent autologous cranioplasty at 3 months. On examination, he was awake, alert, and oriented to self, time, and location; he exhibited dysarthric speech, right ptosis, but followed commands in all four extremities with no focal motor weakness."
