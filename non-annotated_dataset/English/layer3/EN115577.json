  "text": "A 47-year-old Chinese man presented to our Department of Ophthalmology with a 26-month history of painless swelling and redness left upper eyelid. Surgical excisions of the left lacrimal gland were performed. A histopathology examination showed follicular hyperplasia with reactive germinal centres and eosinophilic infiltration involving the interfollicular areas as well as proliferation of post capillary venules, all signs of Kimura disease. Immunohistochemical analysis of the cells demonstrated positive staining for CK, Vimentin, CD3, CD4, CD20, CD21, CD117, CD5, CD8, CD23, IgG and IgG4 (30 per high-power field) and negative staining for CD10 and CD34. Some ophthalmologists in our department questioned whether the histological and immunohistochemical findings were also compatible with features of IgG4-related diseases. There was no sign of recurrence during the twelve months of regular follow-up."
