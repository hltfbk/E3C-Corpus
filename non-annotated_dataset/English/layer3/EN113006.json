  "text": "In this paper, we focus on the transactional nature of health value generation networks. First, we analyze the transactions in the networks. We then propose a design structure-the Community Health Experience Model-for effective person-centered health value generation networks. In the second phase of the work, we describe how the system design of the complete transaction network was tested in a real-life pilot environment focusing on fall prevention in individuals with osteoporosis.As a result of the network-based collaborative service approach, fall risk decreased by 11.8% and the number of falls decreased by 4.5% within 3 months. Regarding the major health experience outcomes, self-evaluated condition-specific health literacy improved from 7.85 to 8.26 (an improvement of 0.41), while self-evaluated condition-specific self-management capability changed from 7.25 to 8.06 (0.81 improvement)."
