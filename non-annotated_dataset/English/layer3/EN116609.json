  "text": "We present the case of a 67-year-old Caucasian woman of high economic status and educational level with no psychopathological symptoms and no history of mental disorders who developed dissociative paraplegia after epidural anesthesia. The neurological examination revealed incongruous features, and repeated spine magnetic resonance imaging was normal. Three years earlier the patient had transient paralysis of her left lower limb without detectable cause."
