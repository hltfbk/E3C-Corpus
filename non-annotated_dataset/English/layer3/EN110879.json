  "text": "A 38-year-old male patient was diagnosed with HH for 7 years. The initial presentation of the mass was progressive abdominal distention causing early satiety, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, vomiting, dysphagia and weight loss. Later, the patient developed bilateral lower extremity edema. Imaging with computed tomography (CT scan) showed a large mass measuring 32.4*26*3.1 cm which was considered unresectable. The patient underwent a deceased donor liver transplantation. The excised mass was 9 kg. After nine days of hospitalization the patient was discharged in good condition. Three months later, the patient was admitted due to fever and cytomegalovirus infection for which he received intravenous ganciclovir and was discharged. In the latest follow-up the patient had no liver or kidney dysfunction eight months after the transplantation."
