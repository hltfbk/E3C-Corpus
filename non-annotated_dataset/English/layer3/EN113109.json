  "text": "A 66-year-old woman with a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in her left eye underwent pars plana vitrectomy. During the intraocular photocoagulation for a retinal tear after fluid-air exchange, a vitreous hemorrhage and suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) developed. The surgical incisions were closed after filling the vitreous cavity with silicone oil. Two weeks later, the hemolyzed hemorrhage was removed, and new silicone oil was injected. After the surgery, a low reflective region was detected near the macula in the swept-source optical coherence tomographic (SS-OCT) images. The low reflective region was caused by the residual hemorrhage. The size of the reflective region gradually decreased and was not present at 3Â months. We conclude that SS-OCT can be used to follow the resolution of a suprachoroidal hemorrhage."
