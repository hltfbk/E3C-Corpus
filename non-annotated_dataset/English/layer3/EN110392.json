  "text": "The patient A.B. is 37 years old, known for having a moderate asthma treated with on demand bronchodilator therapy. It is a first spontaneous pregnancy. Pregnancy wasn't followed and had an apparently normal course. Patient was referred to our unit for having uterine leiomyoma at 37 weeks of pregnancy. The obstetrical examination found an exaggerated uterine height at 38cm and an empty pelvic excavation. Ultrasound screening showed a praevia isthmic leiomyoma measuring 16cm; fetal biometry measurements were eutrophic and placental insertion was fundic. Patient was immediately hospitalized in our unit; received corticosteroids for lung fetal maturation and a Caesarean delivery was scheduled 24 hours later. Skin incision was median with the per operative discovery of a large interstitial isthmic uterine myoma measuring 40cm. Hysterectomy was corporeal. The post-operative and puerperium course was normal with a home return at the fifth day."
