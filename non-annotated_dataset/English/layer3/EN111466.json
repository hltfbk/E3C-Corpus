  "text": "Three patients presented with abdominal pain (chronic pain in cases 1 and 2, and acute pain in Case 3), hematochezia (Case 2), and intestinal obstruction (Case 3). All patients had a history of abdominal surgery and intraoperative use of NBCA MG. Abdominal computed tomography and gastroenterological endoscopy revealed foreign bodies (solidified MG in cases 1 and 2) and intestinal obstruction related to a mass of residual non-absorbed MG causing an internal hernia from a dense adhesion (Case 3). All patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed duodenal perforation, colonic erosion, and an internal hernia, all of which was related to MG use. We undertook removal of the foreign bodies (cases 1 and 2), surgical closure of the site of duodenal erosion (Case 1), partial colectomy (Case 2), and partial enterectomy (Case 3)."
