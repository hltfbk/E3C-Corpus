  "text": "After a frozen-thawed cycle of ICSI, the beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) level at 4 weeks 0 days of gestation was 3.4 IU/L. Subsequent dysfunctional uterine bleeding was mistaken for menstruation; however, an AEP of 9 weeks with a fetal heart beat was observed by ultrasound. After the AEP was observed by ultrasound, it was extracted laparoscopically."
