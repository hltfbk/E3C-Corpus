  "text": "We report a case of a plantar intramuscular hemangioma in 25-year-old patient with a history of percutaneous therapy. Patient had undergone intralesional sclerotherapy 3 years prior to his admission with persistent pain on weight bearing activities.MRI demonstrated a multi lobulated lesion of the 1st IMS with a peripheral enhancement on gadolinium injection. The patient underwent elective surgery with complete excision and no functional impairment at the last follow-up 3 years after surgery."
