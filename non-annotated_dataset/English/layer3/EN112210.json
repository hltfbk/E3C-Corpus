  "text": "A 52-year-old woman presented with a 10-day history of nausea and vomiting accompanied by yellowing of the skin and mucosa. Further, her free T3 (FT3) and FT4 levels were significantly elevated, whereas her thyrotropin level was reduced. After admission, her condition continued to deteriorate, and she presented with continued high fever, vomiting, palpitation, and shortness of breath. After being diagnosed with thyroid storm, the patient was immediately treated with PE combined with DPMAS. Her symptoms improved immediately. After three PE + DPMAS treatments, and she was discharged from the hospital. She was treated with methylprednisolone and methylthimidazole. After six months, the patient spontaneously discontinued methylthimidazole treatment. Her previous clinical manifestations and liver dysfunction reoccurred.
