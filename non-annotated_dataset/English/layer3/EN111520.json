  "text": "The patient was a 43-year-old man with MALS identified at the onset of SMA dissection. After treatment for the SMA dissection, he underwent laparoscopic MAL release. Using the technique of laparoscopic gastrectomy within the surgical field, we performed laparoscopic MAL release and ganglionectomy safely with a good view. Immediate symptomatic improvement was acquired, and no recurrence was observed at the 20-month follow-up."
