  "text": "A 74-year-old female believed to have an adnexal mass on prior imaging presented with small bowel obstruction, which failed to resolve with non-operative management. Given her suspected adnexal mass, multidisciplinary operative intervention was arranged. She was found to have a large, extraluminal mass on her small intestines; serving as the lead point for her midgut volvulus and resultant small bowel obstruction."
