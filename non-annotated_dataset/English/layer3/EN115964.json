  "text": "A 24-year-old woman who had undergone bilateral FLEx with the VisuMax femtosecond laser treatment for myopic astigmatism complained of double vision in her left eye after the operation. The manifest refraction was -0.50/-1.25 × 180°. The corneal topography showed a central-inferior steepened zone. The ocular wavefront measurements displayed a high value of total aberrations as well as coma. She was scheduled for an enhancement procedure and it was performed by relifting the primary FLEx flap in the left eye four months later. Ablation was made with the Mel-80 excimer laser. After retreatment, the corresponding aberrations were diminished and the corneal topography turned flattened. Her symptom resolved completely with good visual outcomes."
