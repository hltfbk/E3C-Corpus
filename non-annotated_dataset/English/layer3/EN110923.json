  "text": "A 59-year-old male patient presented with a 3-year history of swelling of the left knee, with occasional pain. There was no history of trauma or any constitutional symptoms. There was an apparent swelling (10 cm Ã—5 cm in size) around the anterolateral aspect of the knee joint. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a multilobular, complex cystic lesion of the lateral HFP. Surgical excision of the cyst was done, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of the ganglion cyst."
