  "text": "A 67- year-old woman with no medical history, nulligravida, post-menopausal since the age of 52, consulted for vaginal bleeding for about 2 weeks. Clinical examination revealed an endocervical bleeding without any suspicious vaginal or cervical lesions. Transvaginal Ultrasound showed an endometrial hypertrophy and an endometrial curettage biopsy performed afterwards revealed a poorly differentiated cancerous process. The patient had an RMI that objectified a complete septate uterus with a 40 mm tumor process limited to the right side. A total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral-salpingo-oopho-rectomy and staging (bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection and pelvic washings) were performed. Pathological examination of the surgical specimen showed a macroscopically uterus 9x7, 5x2cm with normal external configuration. The coronal examination confirmed the presence of a total septum reaching the cervical canal with a 4.9 cm long axis whith a whitish tumor process in the right cavity. The microscopic study revealed the presence of a tumor lesion corresponding to an endometrioid adenocarcinoma grade I of the WHO classification that infiltrated more than the one half of the myometrium without any peritumoral vascular embolus. In the left side, an atrophic endometrium was found. The bilateral adnexae, parametia and pelvic lymph nodes were all free of tumor."
