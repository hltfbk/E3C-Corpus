  "text": "We describe a case of meningitis treated with fosfomycin, which showed partial effectiveness in an 80-year-old patient. After a lethal myocardial infarction, M. caprae (MC) was identified in cerebrospinal fluid culture. This isolated acid-fast organism was first identified as MTBC by MTBC-specific PCR (16S rDNA-PCR). Furthermore, species-specific identification of the isolate was done by gyrB PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of a part of gyrB DNA. Colony morphology of the isolated MC strain showed dysgonic growth on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. The strain was susceptible to pyrazinamide (PZA)."
