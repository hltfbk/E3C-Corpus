  "text": "A 32-year male information technology employee experienced a road traffic accident and developed pain, localized swelling over dorsum of the left hand. He exhibited an inability to form a complete fist with the index finger lagging behind, giving a pointing index finger like appearance. Plain radiographs showed isolated disruption of second metacarpal-trapezoid articulation. The computed tomography (CT) scans were used to confirm the absence of associated carpal injuries. The patient was managed successfully by closed reduction and Kirschner wiring. All the deformities resolved and regained normal hand functions in the follow-up period of 13 months with no recurrent episodes or evidence of arthritis."
