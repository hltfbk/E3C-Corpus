  "text": "We report a case of a 9-month-old female presenting with a 2-month history of abdominal distension. Ultrasonographic and computed tomographic assessments demonstrated features consistent with bilateral, diffuse, hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis (DHPLNB) for which she underwent chemotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging 6Â weeks following commencement of chemotherapy revealed a mass concerning for unilateral Wilms tumor for which she underwent partial nephrectomy. Pathology confirmed DHPLNB with a unilateral Wilms tumor."
