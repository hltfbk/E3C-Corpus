  "text": "We evaluated renal disease in two 47-year-old Japanese men with liver cirrhosis and chronic alcoholism for 34 years and 27 years, respectively. Renal biopsy demonstrated massive wire loop-like deposits in the subendothelial space of the glomerular basement membrane and in the mesangium. However, immunofluorescence was only positive for IgA and C3, and electron microscopy did not reveal any organized structures in the electron-dense deposits. IgA nephropathy was diagnosed, although the features were different from primary IgA nephropathy. Both patients had portosystemic shunts associated with liver cirrhosis. Their renal deposits and proteinuria resolved completely after 1 year of steroid therapy."
