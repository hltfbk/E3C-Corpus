  "text": "In this report, we describe a case of a 61-year-old Caucasian woman with a symptomatic retroperitoneal mass. The specimen obtained from her resection contained a protuberant encapsulated mass, exhibiting microscopic features consistent with localized, unicentric Castleman's disease. These characteristics included architectural features and immunohistochemical findings consistent with the hyaline vascular variant of Castleman's disease."
