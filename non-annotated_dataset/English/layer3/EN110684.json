  "text": "A patient was referred from the emergency department to a tertiary ophthalmology centre with bilateral exquisite eye pain, inability to open the eyes, photosensitivity and reduced vision. She underwent cosmetic plasma fibroblast skin tightening treatment at her local salon four hours earlier. She was found to have bilateral alkali chemical eye injuries with significant diffuse corneal epithelial loss. The injury was thought to be caused by inadvertent ocular exposure to EMLA cream, which was used in preparation for the plasma fibroblast skin tightening treatment. She was treated with topical antibiotics and achieved satisfactory recovery."
