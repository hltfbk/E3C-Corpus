An ophthalmology examination showed visual acuity of the right eye 1/60, mild dilatation of the pupil and posterior synechiae, vitreous was hazy, and fundus examination showed optic nerve head not well demarcated and hyperaemic with the good retina and macula reflex. Laboratory examination showed reactive anti-Toxoplasma immunoglobulin G.
