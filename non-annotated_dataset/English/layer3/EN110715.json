  "text": "A 60-year-old male was admitted due to progressive abdominal pain and poor appetite. He was diagnosed with multiple recurrent CE with abdominal aortic involvement according to preoperative evaluation. During surgical resection, major aortic bleeding accidentally occurred while dissecting the cyst, which was firmly attached to the abdominal aortic wall. Hemostasis attempts were conducted to deal with this emergency situation and maintain circulation. Post-interventional recovery was uneventful, and 2-year follow-up showed no sign of recurrence or any other complications."
