  "text": "A 30-year-old man with diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage and rapid progressive renal function caused by anti-glomerular basement membrane disease presented atypical symptoms without hemoptysis, accompanied by life-threatening hypoxemia. Plasmapheresis was performed, and glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide were administered. The patient started to show signs of improvement. Percutaneous renal biopsy is an appropriate diagnostic measure that is commonly safe, but this patient experienced hemorrhage after operation, thus necessitating embolization of the renal artery to stop the bleeding. The patient's condition was improved, and the serum anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody level was 106 AU/mL (normal range: < 24 AU/mL) and slowly decreased. His discharge medications were oral daily prednisone (30 mg) and continued maintenance hemodialysis."
