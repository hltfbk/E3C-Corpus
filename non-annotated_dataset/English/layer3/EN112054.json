  "text": "An 80-year-old man presented with decreased hearing on the right side accompanied by a disturbance of balance 10 months prior to admission. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an 8 × 7 cm osteolytic mass in the right posterior fossa related to the petrous bone, with extension to the cervical region. During surgery, the tumor was found to be located extradurally, with no invasion of the dura. The tumor was removed entirely, apart from a small portion around the jugular foramen to avoid lower cranial nerve injury."
