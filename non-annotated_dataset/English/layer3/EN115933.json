  "text": "We present the case of a 27-year-old woman of Arabic ethnicity, who complained of a short history of severe abdominal pain with the background of recurrent abdominal pain and vomiting. An abdominal computerized tomography scan revealed a torted wandering spleen. This required a splenectomy due to splenic infarction."
