  "text": "A 59-year-old postmenopausal woman was referred to the gynecologist because of abnormal vaginal bleeding. The radiological assessment revealed an intrapelvic multicystic mass, which was interpreted as an early right ovarian cancer and then removed by radical surgery. Histologically, the cancer cells were found in the bilateral ovaries and para-aortic lymph nodes. The cancer cells showed high-grade nuclear atypia and various morphologies, including the solid, pseudo-endometrioid, transitional cell-like (SET) pattern, and mucin-producing patterns. Benign and/or borderline mucin-producing epithelium, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, and endometriosis-related lesions were not observed. In immunohistochemistry analyses, the cancer cells were diffuse positive for p53; block positive for p16; partial positive for WT1, ER, PgR, CDX2 and PAX8; and negative for p40, p63, GATA3, Napsin A, and vimentin. The Ki-67 labeling index of the cancer cells was 60-80%. Direct sequencing revealed that the cancer cells contained a missense mutation (c.730G>A) in the TP53 gene."
