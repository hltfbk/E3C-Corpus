  "text": "Highly refractile, crystal-like lesions were found in the macula of a 62 year old male patient with chronically uncontrolled gout. The lesions appeared at the termination of retinal arterioles and were located at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium. The lesions did not stain with fluorescein and were associated with larger areas geographic atrophy. Review of the patient's blood tests revealed well-controlled vasculopathic risk factors. Fundus appearance and best-corrected visual acuity remained stable over 12 months of follow-up during which the uric acid levels were well controlled."
