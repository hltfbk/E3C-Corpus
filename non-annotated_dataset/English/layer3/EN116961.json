  "text": "We present the case of a patient with a retroperitoneal malignant triton tumor. A 32-year-old male was referred with epigastric pain and an abdominal mass. Computed tomography revealed a huge soft tissue retroperitoneal mass that involved adjacent organs and vessels. Complete resection was undertaken. Pathological examination confirmed the presence of a malignant triton tumor. The patient died two and a half months after surgery, as a result of local recurrence."
