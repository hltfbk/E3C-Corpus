  "text": "A 44-year-old uniocular housewife sustained a large corneoscleral laceration following a fall. She underwent primary suturing and was subsequently referred for repair of retinal detachment. She underwent resuturing of her gaping wound, pars plana vitrectomy and scleral buckle. Postoperative visual acuity was 6/120 due to a large macular hole. Visual acuity dropped to hand motion 5 times in a recurrent fashion due to diffuse intraocular hemorrhage. Vascularized fibrous downgrowth was the identifiable source of bleeding into the anterior and posterior chambers. This was controlled by 21 intracorneal and subconjunctival bevacizumab injections over 2.5 years of therapy."
