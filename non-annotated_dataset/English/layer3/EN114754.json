  "text": "A 73-year-old Japanese woman with RA was admitted with shortness of breath. Five weeks previously, she had been started on etanercept in addition to methotrexate (MTX). Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated diffuse ground glass opacities distributed throughout the bilateral middle to lower lung fields, and serum Î²-D-glucan was elevated. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed no P. jirovecii, but the organism was detected by polymerase chain reaction method. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was administered with methylprednisolone pulse therapy. However, the follow-up chest X-ray and chest CT demonstrated aggravation of the pneumonia with architectural distortions. Additional direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin B-immobilized fibers and intravenous cyclophosphamide therapy were insufficiently effective, and the patient died on day 25."
