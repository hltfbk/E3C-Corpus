  "text": "We present a rare case of bilateral ossification of the auricles in a 75-years old man with profound progressive rigidity of both auricles. His main complaint was a mild discomfort during resting making sleeping unpleasant without any other serious symptoms. His medical history was significant for predisposing factors for this condition such as, Addison's disease and diabetes mellitus. Excisional biopsy was performed confirming the ossified nature of the auricles. Further treatment deemed unnecessary in our case due to his mild clinical picture."
