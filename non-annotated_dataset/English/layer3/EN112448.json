  "text": "This case report presents on a patient with a well-functioning revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) who suffered a periprosthetic tibia fracture. Initial treatment with plating failed and the fracture had to be revised due to an infectious non-union with a multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and its eradication was complicated by septic loosening of the patient's knee arthroplasty. After multiple revisions of the nonunion, a two-stage exchange arthroplasty with a partial replacement of the distal femur due to a bone defect was necessary to obtain an acceptable result."
