  "text": "A 39-year-old Namibian male was referred to Intermediate Hospital Oshakati from his local community hospital for evaluation of progressive swelling of his right thigh. The patient, with a known history of alcoholic liver disease, had been fairly well until 2 weeks prior to presentation to his local hospital, when he gradually developed jaundice which was followed by acute onset right thigh pain and swelling. He described the pain as burning in nature which radiated downwards into his right foot. The pain was exacerbated by movement and alleviated with rest. The pain gradually worsened with inability to use the right lower limb. There was associated bluish discolouration of the overlying skin. The patient denied a history of previous trauma or penetrating injury, fever, warmth to touch of the limb, loss of weight or bleeding from other orifices. Neither did the patient consume any anticoagulation therapy, NSAIDS and aspirin, nor did the patient have a previous background of a bleeding disorder or family history of a bleeding disorder. This was the 2 nd episode with a similar episode 4 years ago in 2015 which resolved gradually, the same year he was diagnosed with alcoholic liver disease. The rest of the medical and surgical history was unremarkable. The patient had a significant history of alcohol, drinking approximately 1 to 2 bottles of Whiskey a day during the 9 months prior to this presentation. This followed a period of alcohol cessation after the prior presentation in 2015. At presentation, he had normal blood pressure of 121/68mmHg with a tachycardic of 121beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/ min. He was apyrexial with a temperature of 36.5Â°C. He was awake and oriented without signs of hepatic encephalopathy and had scleral icterus and leukonychia. Other peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease were absent. His right thigh had pitting oedema extending from the right foot to his gluteus. A circumferential difference of 11 cm measured around the mid-thigh, and 3 cm measured around the calf, compared to the left limb was present. Ecchymosis was present on the posterior thigh, which extended from the gluteal fold to the popliteal fossa. The thigh was severely tender on palpation with decreased range of motion on both active and passive movement. All distal pulses were present. The abdomen was distended with evidence of ascites, liver span of 4cm and no splenomegaly. The examination findings of other systems were normal. The Investigations performed included a complete blood count which showed severe Macrocytic normochromic anaemia with a haemoglobin of 3.60g/L, in addition to thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 37 x 10 9 /L and a reticulocyte production index of 1.1%. The international normalised ratio (INR) was 2,68, a prothrombin time (PT) of 31.30 seconds and the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was 35.2 seconds. His liver panel showed total protein of 65g/L with hypoalbuminemia of 17g/L. The Total Bilirubin was elevated at 149 umol/L and Direct Bilirubin 48 umol/L. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 19 IU/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 90 IU/L with AST to ALT ratio 4.7suggestive of Alcoholic hepatitis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was elevated at 506 IU/L gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 57 IU/L, C-reactive protein 7.8 mg/l and total white cell count of 10.39x10 9 /L. The patient had a normal urea and creatinine with a hyponatraemia of 128mmol/L. His Iron studies performed revealed Ferritin at 2321.03 ng/ml with serum iron of 6.9 umol/L. His viral screen for hepatitis B and C was negative. A doppler ultrasound illustrated extensive tissue oedema with complex mass extending from the upper thigh to the lower thigh suggestive of a right gastrocnemius haematoma, no thrombus noted in the venous system. The ultrasound of the abdomen showed ascites with an echogenic small liver. The computer tomography angiogram (CT-angio) showed normal non-aneurysmal common iliac, femoral and popliteal arterial vessels. Unfortunately, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was not performed due to local resource constraints. The patient was managed with tranexamic acid 1g eight hourly for a period of 7 days, red cell concentrate (RCC) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions which were repeated over 3 separate days during hospitalization as well vitamin k 10mg titrated against his serial INR measurements. He was given adequate pain relief and thiamine. He was hospitalized for 17 days, during this period the swelling gradually reduced and then maintained a constant size. Health education on his condition and prognosis was explained at which he requested to be transferred to his local hospital for better family support. He was advised to stop alcohol consumption and follow up with a local social worker for long-term alcohol support."
