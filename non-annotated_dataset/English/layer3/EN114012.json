  "text": "The patient, a 75-year-old Asian woman with a history of osteoporosis, underwent cementless TKA. Knee radiography at 5 weeks postoperatively showed radiolucent lines outlined beneath the tibial tray and around the stem. The tibial component was considered unstable due to loosening. A 56.5 Âµg weekly dose of teriparatide (rh [1-34] parathyroid hormone) was administered. After 2 months of treatment, knee pain and knee swelling had disappeared. Tomosynthesis taken after 6 months of treatment confirmed complete ingrowth of the component to the bone."
