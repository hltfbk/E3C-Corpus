  "text": "We present a case of a 51-year-old man with a small (0.9Â cm) hyperechoic lesion of the left testicle mimicking testicular cancer on multiparametric ultrasound. The lesion was localized in the peripheral zone, confirming vascularization and increased stiffness on contrast-enhanced ultrasound and real-time elastography. Preoperative tumor markers and hormone levels were within normal ranges. Staging computed tomography was negative. Organ-sparing surgery with tumor enucleation and frozen section analysis was performed, confirming testicular adenomatoid tumor."
