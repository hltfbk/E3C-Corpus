  "text": "A 28-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital due to unstable gait caused by pain in the right hallux, for which she was unable to stretch for over three months. The patient had undergone \"resection of ameloblastoma at the right mandible, mandibulectomy, and autogenous right fibula grafting\". The patient's hallux toe, as well as the second and third toes of the right foot could not be stretched, with pain in all the toes during walking. Based on the medical records of the patient, as well as the results of physical and auxiliary examinations, the main diagnosis was checkrein deformity in the right foot. Since the patient refused surgical treatment, rehabilitation was the only treatment option. At discharge, the patient reported evident improvement in the pain in the toes, gait stability, as well as increased ability to climb up and downstairs."
