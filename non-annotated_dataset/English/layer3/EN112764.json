  "text": "We present the case of a male athlete who complained of pain in the left buttock and difficulty walking after a 3months old reported trauma with pain and hematoma in his left thigh, during a kick with his contralateral leg. Due to a radiographic finding of a suspicious lesion near his left ischial tuberosity, an extensive investigation that included computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, bone scintigraphic scan, and blood analysis followed the diagnosis of apophysitis of the ischial tuberosity was determined and the proposed non-surgical treatment had satisfactory results."
