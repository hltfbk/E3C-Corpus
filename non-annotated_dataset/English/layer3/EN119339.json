  "text": "The authors report a clinical case of a 62 year old woman, admitted to hospital with left flank pain. Plain radiographs of the abdomen, ultrasound, CT and MRI scans were performed and the presence of a 3-cm lesion of the left adrenal gland was demonstrated. A diagnosis of hydatid cyst was made. The patient underwent transabdominal laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of a hydatid cyst in the left adrenal gland."
