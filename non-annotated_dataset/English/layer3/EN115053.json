  "text": "We present the case of a 49-year-old woman who suffered from a radioulnar synostosis of the forearm due to malpositioned K wires after TBW treatment. The patient was treated by heterotopic bone resection supported by ossification prophylaxis (radiotherapy and Indomethacin). At follow-up of 12 months after revision surgery, elbow motion was unrestricted with a strength grade 5/5. The patient was free of pain and reported no restrictions in daily as well as sporting activities. Radiologic assessment showed no recurrence of heterotopic bone tissue."
