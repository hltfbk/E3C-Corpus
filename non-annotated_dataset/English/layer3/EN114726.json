  "text": "A 38-year-old female was transported to our department with persistent cough and chest pain. The operation of mitral valve replacement was scheduled after a provisional diagnosis of serious mitral stenosis. During the operation, we found that a large polypoid mass infiltrating mainly the mitral valve and part of the left atria. We removed the tumor as completely as possible and replaced the mitral valve. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of undifferentiated sarcoma after operation. The patient was asymptomatic with no recurrence at 3-month follow-up."
