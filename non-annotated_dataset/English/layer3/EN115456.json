  "text": "A 65 year old woman presented with anterior knee pain and inability to flex her knee more than 90Â° since 1 year. Clinical examination and imaging studies revealed a nodular calcific mass in the anterior portion of the knee i.e. patella. Following excision, histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of extra-osseous osteochondroma-like soft tissue mass, with no recurrence in 36 weeks."
