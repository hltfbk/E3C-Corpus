  "text": "A 83-year-old hypertensive man presented for dizziness and hypotension. The patient had oliguria and mottled skin. Transthoracic echocardiography disclosed a circumferential pericardial effusion with a compressed right atrium, confirmed by contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scan. A pig-tail catheter allowed to withdraw 500 mL of blood, resulting in a transient improvement of hemodynamics. Rapidly, recurrent hypotension prompted a reoperation. An active bleeding was identified at the level of the retroventricular coronary artery. The pericardium was thickened with several \"sharping\" calcified plaques in the vicinity of the bleeding areas. On day 2, vasopressors were stopped and the patient was successfully extubated. Final diagnosis was a spontaneous cardiac tamponade secondary to a coronary artery injury attributed to a \"sharping\"calcified pericardial plaque."
