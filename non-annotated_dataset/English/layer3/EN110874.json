  "text": "In 2011, a 66-year-old Japanese woman underwent computed tomography (CT) that revealed a cystic lesion in the tail of the pancreas measuring 9 mm. She did not have any symptoms. She underwent a CT scan every year thereafter. The cystic lesion gradually increased and was 40 mm in 2019; endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) was then performed. Cytological examination demonstrated class IIIb adenocarcinoma, and we conducted laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Pathological examination showed PNET."
