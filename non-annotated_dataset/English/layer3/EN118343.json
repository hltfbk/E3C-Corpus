  "text": "A two-month-old Saudi baby girl presented with fever, respiratory distress due to bronchiolitis, exfoliative erythroderma and a family history of childhood death within the first few months of life in two of her sisters who had had a similar clinical presentation to her own. Immunological work-up revealed an absence of circulating B lymphocytes, whereas various numbers of activated T lymphocytes were present in the peripheral blood and in the skin."
