  "text": "We report the case of a 36-year-old Greek woman experiencing chronic constipation due to a benign presacral teratoma. Imaging examinations showed a pelvic mass without evidence of malignancy. An ovoid tumour with a maximum dimension of 6 cm was surgically removed. A histologic examination revealed a mature cystic teratoma. Two years after surgery, the patient is well, with no evidence of recurrence and no constipation."
