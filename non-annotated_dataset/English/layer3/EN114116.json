  "text": "A 39-year-old otherwise healthy female presented with an acute febrile illness complicated by severe small joint and large joint arthritis, jaundice, acute kidney injury and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) mimicking palindromic rheumatism or severe sepsis. She later developed a widespread fern-leaf pattern necrotic skin rash with evidence of vasculitis on the palms and soles, aiding the clinical diagnosis of SFGR. She had very high antibody titres against R. conorii antigen confirming the diagnosis and recovered completely with anti-rickettsial therapy."
