  "text": "We present here a rare case of floating shoulder with axillary artery injury in a 34-year-old woman. The patient complained of pain and numbness of her left upper limb after losing control of her motorcycle on a highway and falling from the vehicle 2 h ago. No blood pressure reading could be obtained from her left upper limb and no blood oxygen readings could be obtained from any of her left fingers. Computed tomography angiography and duplex ultrasonography revealed interruption of blood flow through the axillary artery, with distal flow being maintained through collateral arteries. The clinical diagnosis including fracture of the left proximal humerus, the left clavicle, and the left scapula, left axillary artery rupture, and left brachial plexus injury. We successfully performed open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture and vascular repair. The patient showed satisfactory recovery that was observed during 4-mo follow-up."
