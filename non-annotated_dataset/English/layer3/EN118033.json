  "text": "A previously healthy 23-year-old male, presented with blurred vision to the Emergency Department of our Hospital. After initial clinical and serological examination, he was admitted to our clinic for further investigation. Neurological examination showed left homonymous hemianopsia. Brain MRI revealed edema of the right parietal lobe, compressing the posterior region of the right ventricle. Serum viral, immunological and paraneoplasmatic testing were negative. Spectroscopic MRI described the lesions as tumefactive demyelinated plaques. After treating the patient with intravenous corticosteroids, his symptoms rapidly improved and the extensive lesion of the parietal lobe decreased."
