  "text": "Herein, we report a 15-year-old male with bullous HSP who presented with severe abdominal pain and hemorrhagic bullous lesions over his lower extremities. He was treated with corticosteroid, after which the symptoms improved dramatically. No recurrence was noted after follow-up, though scarring was present. We also reviewed the literature related to bullous HSP and identified 39 cases, most of whom were treated with corticosteroids."
