  "text": "A 22-year-old woman complained of painful erythema, papules and pustules on the face. She had fever and malaise during the sixth week of her first pregnancy and a history of the mild eruption and seborrhea before her pregnancy with flaring over the preceding 4 weeks. Dermatologic examination revealed red erythema of all involved facial areas; the lesions consisted of papules, pustules and nodules. The case was diagnosed as rosacea fulminans (pyoderma faciale) by these findings. In the literature, there are some effective therapeutic options such as retinoids, tetracyclines, antiandrogenic contraceptives, and dapsone and these were not used because they are contraindicated in pregnancy. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1 gr/day, wet compresses, and a fusidic acid cream were started. After the activity of the disease had been suppressed for 10 days, antibiotic was stopped, and the other treatment options were applied topically for the next month. One month after cessation of treatment, the lesions had disappeared with only mild erythema remaining. There was minimally flushing on the face and no telangiectasia."
