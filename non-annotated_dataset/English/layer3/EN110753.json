  "text": "A 64-year-old male presented with HUS following bloody diarrhea. Nephrotic-range proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia were present at the acute stage and renal histology revealed common TMA features. Neurological involvement presented as confusion and impaired cognitive function. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bilateral T2 hyperintensities in the brainstem and insula. The patient received plasma exchange and supportive care. Both the renal and neurological impairments were completely recovered 3 months after the onset."
