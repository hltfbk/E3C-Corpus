On examination; the child was febrile (39°C) with neck stiffness and distended abdomen. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was positive for Salmonella Typhi. In addition on urine sediments microscopy, Schistosoma haematobium eggs were seen. The child improved clinically on ceftriaxone and praziquantel, and was discharged 3 weeks after admission."
