  "text": "We present the case of a 34-year-old Hispanic male with a history of cigarette smoking. He was admitted to our Institution in 2002 with a 1-year evolution of odynophagia, initially to solids and then to liquids. The patient was referred to our Institution for an undifferentiated carcinoma of the epiglottis treated one week earlier with laser surgery and positive surgical margins. Upon admittance, the patient did not demonstrate any tumor activity. A review of the slides confirmed undifferentiated carcinoma. Chemo-radiotherapy was proposed to the patient, but he accepted only radiotherapy and received a total dose of 70 Gy. The patient was followed-up every 3 months. Two years later, follow-up nasofibrolaryngoscopy demonstrated clear evidence of tumor activity at the site of the primary tumor (supraglottis). No cervical adenopathies were found either clinically or radiologically. Biopsy of the lesion was inconclusive; hence, the patient was scheduled for a suspension microlaryngoscopy with transoperative study, performing afterwards a supraglottic horizontal laryngectomy. Histological diagnosis reported ulcerated, high-grade supraglottic mucoepidermoid carcinoma with lymphatic permeation and invasion to the striate muscle and adipose tissue. The borders and surgical bed were free of neoplasm. The patient evolved satisfactorily. At 4 years following treatment, the patient is disease free."
