  "text": "In this report, we present the case of a 52-year-old woman with successful regression of pleomorphic carcinoma of the lung following nivolumab therapy. She developed purpura fulminans (PF) ultimately resulting in amputation of both lower extremities. Blood tests revealed thrombocytopenia with increased serum soluble IL-2 receptor, ferritin, and triglyceride levels suggesting hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). In addition, serum A disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 13 activity was decreased, suggesting thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Further detailed analysis revealed severe hypercytokinemia including increased levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IFNγ, and G-CSF."
