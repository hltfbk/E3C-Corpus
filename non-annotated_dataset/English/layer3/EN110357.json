  "text": "The patient is 2-year-old male, first born child of non-consanguineous Moroccan healthy parents with an ordinary family history, after uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. After birth, the infant had been suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections and frequently admitted to the hospital. Subsequent examinations revealed multiple malformations such as unique facial features, Tetralogy of Fallot, bilateral ear anomalies, and micropenis. Based on the above observations, he was suspected to have CHARGE syndrome."
