  "text": "We present a case wherein a 62-year-old Japanese rheumatoid arthritis woman, with HSV uveitis, presented with hemorrhagic hypopyon in the anterior chamber and a fever with photophobia. Patient was treated with antiviral drugs which improved the hyphema and corneal lesions, but lesions recurred 3 months later. This rare presentation of HSV induced uveitis, and its subsequent recurrence, aroused suspicion of an additional hypopyon-inducing pathology. On account of previous history of lung opacities and elevated LDH, intravascular lymphoma was eventually diagnosed via lung biopsy. She was treated for the lymphoma which also completely resolved all ocular symptoms without any recurrence as of 1.5 years later."
