  "text": "A 62-year-old man with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma presented with fatigue, a palpable tender abdominal mass and clinical signs of progressing intestinal obstruction. The preoperative evaluation failed to prove recurrence of the lymphoma or any other definite diagnosis. A laparotomy was performed through a midline incision. The mesentery resembled a tumour-like thickened and fibrotic mass. Abundant, rigid intestinal loop adhesions were observed. Diffuse fibrotic infiltration of the ileum and of the sigmoid colon, which obviously affected the intestinal vascular supply, were identified. A right colectomy and partial sigmoidectomy were performed. Pathological evaluation revealed extensive myofibroblastic reaction of the mesentery with accompanying loci of fat necrosis and areas of inflammation. A diffuse fibrotic infiltration that focally showed a ground-glass appearance was observed. The post-operative course was complicated by respiratory insufficiency and infections and the patient died 2 months after the operation."
