  "text": "A 13-year-old boy presented with pain, swelling and deformity of the left knee since 4 days. X-Ray revealed a foreign body in the left knee joint. The glass foreign body remained in the subcutaneous tissue for few days and later migrated into the knee joint. Arthroscopy revealed partial tear in the ACL at the femoral attachment with about 10-20 % of fibres being involved. The glass piece was removed arthroscopically and the ACL fibres were trimmed."
