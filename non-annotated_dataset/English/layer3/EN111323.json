Three years after the operation, echocardiography revealed dysfunction of the prosthetic valve thus reoperation was decided. In the second operation, the patient underwent a bioprosthesis valve and AV complete block developed in the postoperative period. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 45% was found on echocardiography. Pacemaker dependence of the patient, it was aimed to place two electrodes into the left ventricle. Electrodes were placed the target two branches in coronary sinus (CS) and right atrium. Univentricular bifocal pacing was enabled to work."
