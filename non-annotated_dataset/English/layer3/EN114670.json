  "text": "A 16 years old female case of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia had bilateral Shepherd's crook deformity of the proximal femur with bilateral non - union of pathological fracture of neck femur. We managed each side in one stage with two osteotomies. On the right side, first oblique osteotomy was done from just distal to the greater trochanter up to the level of the neck and the second; lateral closing wedge abduction osteotomy was done at the subtrochanteric level. 2 months later on the left side double lateral closing wedge abduction osteotomies were performed both at the subtrochanteric level. Fixation of both the sides was done using a 135° Dynamic Richard's screw with a long side plate to span the osteotomy sites and the lesion. Post - operatively we achieved a neck shaft angle of 135° on right side and 133° on the left side. Follow up imaging showed union at both the osteotomy sites bilaterally and also at the site of the pathological fracture of neck femur. Presently, at 18 months post - operatively, patient is walking full weight bearing without support and there are no signs of recurrence of lesions of fibrous dysplasia or the deformity."
