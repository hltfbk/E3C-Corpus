  "text": "A 63-year-old man underwent open drainage and ileostomy for the perforation of ileocecal tumor. After 3 months, he underwent right hemicolectomy and ileostomy closure. Pathological examination revealed no malignancy, and the ileocecal tumor showed the presence of abscess. He noticed a palpable mass in the left abdomen. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a large abdominal incisional hernia and an enhanced mass of 40 mm in the left rectus muscle. Needle biopsy was performed and the diagnosis was desmoid tumor. He underwent resection of the desmoid tumor and repair of hernia. We performed wide local resection, with a 2-cm surgical margin. The hernia was repaired by simple closure, and the defect in the left abdomen was repaired with reconstruction using the fascia lata patch through plastic surgery."
