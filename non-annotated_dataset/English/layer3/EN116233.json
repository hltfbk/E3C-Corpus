  "text": "A 46-year-old normotensive Chinese man developed a large hematoma in the left basal ganglia after he was diagnosed with CADASIL 2 months ago, the patient did not take any antithrombotics. Susceptibility weighted imaging at pre-ICH showed multiple cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in the bilateral basal ganglia. He experienced migraine at about 10 months post-ICH. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ICH in CADASIL patients with Arg90Cys mutation in exon 3."
