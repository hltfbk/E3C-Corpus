  "text": "In the current paper, we present the case of a 67 year-old patient with recurrent left lumbar pain, increased fatigability and intermittent macroscopic hematuria. He underwent a surgical resection of the left kidney and left hemicolon.The pathological diagnosis was primary extraskeletal renal mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Overall survival was 9 months, with pulmonary metastasis and local recurrence at 6 months. The management of the patient is described, from the initial differential diagnosis, after the first clinical examination to the surgical resection, with a special emphasis on the surgical procedures that were carried out."
