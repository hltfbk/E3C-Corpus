  "text": "A 57 years old man, left-handed, admitted to department of orthopedics at Chambéry Hospital, France, for distal biceps rupture of the left arm after lifting a heavy object. We observed deformed and amyotrophic right upper limb due to radial nerve palsy complicating humeral communitive fracture. The clinical exam revealed \"Popeye's sign\" and palpable mass in the mid-upper arm after flexion of the elbow. The hook test and squeeze test revealed complete rupture. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the elbow didn't show bicipital tuberosity avulsion. Ultrasonography of the elbow showed intra-tendinous distal biceps defect with hematoma around the humeral trochlea. The patient was operated using single anterior approach and three trans-osseous anchoring in correct tension. A splint has been used to immobilize the left upper limb and protect the tendon repair for 6 weeks.Passive and progressive rehabilitation, ranged from 30° to 90° of flexion-extension, was encouraged during this period.Excellent clinical and radiological results were obtained after 4 months."
