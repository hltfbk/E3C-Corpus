  "text": "We present the case of a 24-year-old patient with Goodpasture syndrome. Because of rapid aggravation of kidney function and alveolar hemorrhage-the latter requiring an urgent initiation of mechanical ventilation-therapy with steroids, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide was immediately required. Knowledge of the negative impact on fertility brought up the question about sperm cryopreservation. According to the substituted judgment standard, together with the mother of the patient and based on interdisciplinary evaluation of the situation with specialists from the reproductive endocrinology and urology department, the decision for a testicular sperm extraction in the absence of the possibility to obtain the patient's informed consent was made. Immediate chemotherapy was initiated and continued after the procedure. The patient recovered from the acute illness and was informed retrospectively about the testicular sperm extraction, which he received extremely positively."
