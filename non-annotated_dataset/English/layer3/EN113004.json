  "text": "Here we report a 66-year-old man with treated Castleman disease developing with sequential presence of endocrinopathy polyneuropathy, skin changes, organomegaly and extravascular volume overload within 18Â years, which was finally confirmed as POEMS syndrome by positive monoclonal protein. He was thereafter successfully treated with prednisone and azathioprine as primary therapy and thalidomide as maintenance therapy."
