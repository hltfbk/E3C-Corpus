  "text": "A 28Â year otherwise healthy male presented with primary subfertility with a healthy female counterpart. He was found to have non obstructive azoospermia with low seminal fluid volume. He had normal external genitalia and potency with increased libido. Further evaluation revealed an isolated deficiency of follicle stimulating hormone with elevated testosterone levels. His luteinizing hormone and prolactin levels were normal. Contrast enhanced CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis and MRI scan of the pituitary fossa were normal too."
