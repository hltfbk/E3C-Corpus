  "text": "We report here three cases of recurrent incisional hernias which were dealt by a relatively new method to laparoscopy: the enhanced view totally extraperitoneal repair (e-TEP) retromuscular technique. There were three patients: one after an open onlay repair of lower midline incision, another after an onlay mesh repair of a subcostal incision for open cholecystectomy followed by an intraperitoneal onlay mesh hernioplasty (IPOM) repair, and another after IPOM repair of epigastric hernia. They were treated with the abovementioned technique with satisfying short-term results."
