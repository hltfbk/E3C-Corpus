  "text": "A 60-year-old female patient, presented to the outpatient department of our institute with pain on walking, with no history of trauma. X-ray showed an incidental finding of avulsion of LT of femur. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large intramedullary tumour in the metaphysis though she had no symptoms or signs of malignancy. On further evaluation, she was diagnosed with primary lung carcinoma with widespread metastasis. Biopsy from the proximal femur also revealed a metastatic lesion. She was given palliative treatment in the form of a proximal femoral nail after which she was started on chemoradiation."
