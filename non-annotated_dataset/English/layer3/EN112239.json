  "text": "A 28-year-old female presented with a painful nodule in the right tibia. Radiological examination revealed an oval eccentric osteolytic lesion in the proximal tibia. Histologically, the circumscribed but unencapsulated lesion demonstrated biphasic cellular differentiation. Bland, small epithelioid cells arranged in clusters in the myxoid or collagenous stroma and inconspicuous spindle cells scattered in the hypercellular areas were suggested to originate from Schwann cells according to the detection of S100. Both the elongated spindle cells with thin, wavy nuclei and the spindle cells in fascicular or storiform pattern in hypercellular areas showed a positive immunoreaction for epithelial membrane antigen, indicating perineurial differentiation. Based on histological and immunochemical examinations, the patient was diagnosed with hybrid epithelioid schwannoma/perineurioma. The lesion was resected and has not recurred for 8â€‰months since resection."
