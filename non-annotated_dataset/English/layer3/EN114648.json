  "text": "We report a 48 year male patient with a history of fracture lateral femoral condyle of right knee due to road traffic accident 10 years back, for which he got operated with open reduction and internal fixation with cancellous screws, which subsequently got infected. Primary procedure undertaken was removal of implants, debridement, placement of antibiotic-cement spacer followed by prophylactic medial gastrocnemius flap and a temporary joint spanning external fixator. Definitive procedure undertaken, after clearance of infection in 12 weeks was conversion to a rotating hinge TKR using a lateral para-patellar arthrotomy & tibial tubercle osteotomy to address the challenges of fixed patella in the lateral gutter and contracted ligamentum patellae. At one year follow up, the knee was painless, stable, with satisfactory range of motion and improved function without any infection or aseptic lysis."
