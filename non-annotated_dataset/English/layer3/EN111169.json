  "text": "Three Chinese PA patients were diagnosed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry(GC-MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and molecular diagnostic methods. All patients had onset in the neonatal period. One patient died of infection and metabolic decompensation, and the other two had mild to moderate developmental delay/mental retardation. Mutation analysis of the PCCA gene identified that patient 1 carried the compound heterozygous c.1288C > T(p.R430X) and c.2002G > A(p.G668R), and patient 2 was homozygous for the c.1426C > T(p.R476X) mutation. Mutation analysis of the PCCB gene identified that patient 3 harbored the compound heterozygous mutations c.359_360del AT(p.Y120Cfs*40) and c.1398 + 1G > A. Among these mutations, three (c.1288C > T, c.359_360del AT and c.1398 + 1G > A) are novel."
