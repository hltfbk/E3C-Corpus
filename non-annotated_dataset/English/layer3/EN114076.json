  "text": "We report a case of 48 -year -old male who presented to us with a history of recurrent dislocations of the left shoulder. He had frequent episodes of tonic-clonic seizures 5 years back. He was diagnosed to be suffering from neurocysticercosis of the brain for which he was successfully treated. He did not have any episode of seizure later, but he continued to have repeated episodes of dislocation on his left side only. On examination of his left shoulder, he had normal range of motion. He was found to be very apprehensive, even in the midrange. This made us to suspect glenoid bone loss and hence both magnetic resonance imaging and three -dimensional computed tomography (CT) scan of the left shoulder were ordered. The CT scan revealed bilateral coracoid fractures along with glenoid bone loss. An open bony procedure including iliac crest bone graft was planned after a diagnostic arthroscopy keeping in mind that the latarjet procedure may not be possible due to the coracoid fracture. During the operation, we found that the coracoid fragment was large enough to perform a latarjet procedure rather than doing an iliac crest bone graft. This itself provided stability of the shoulder on abduction and external rotation by providing a bony block not requiring any further procedure for the Hill -Sachs lesion."
