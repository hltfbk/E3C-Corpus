  "text": "An 83 years Welsh lady presented with clinical and radiological features consistent with spinal cord compression. Further investigations confirmed the diagnosis of IgM multiple myeloma. Following localized radiotherapy and five courses of melphalan and prednisolone, the patient achieved partial remission of her myeloma. Later on, the patient had disease progression in the form of rising serum IgM level and the development of multiple plasmacytomas. She was treated with thalidomide, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone and radiotherapy, which resulted in the control of her disease for one year. To our knowledge, this is the second case of IgM myeloma presenting with a plasmacytoma and the first case of IgM myeloma presenting with cord compression caused by plasmacytomas."
