  "text": "We report a rare case of a nonobstructive big urinary bladder diverticulum developed after a long-term urethral catheterization in a 62-year old male diabetic patient with normal subvesical urinary tract. The diverticulum was demonstrated by ultrasonography. Its formation was associated with the decubital changes of the bladder wall when the Foley catheter stayed for a longer period."
