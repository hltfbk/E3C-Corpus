  "text": "We report two cases of isolated scapular tuberculosis. One patient underwent aspiration and was started on antituberculous drugs (ATT) and the other underwent debridement, drainage of abscess and then was started on ATT. Both had excellent outcomes at the end of one year follow up. We reviewed previous published literature of isolated scapular tuberculosis. The most common presentation of scapular tuberculosis is as follows: age less than 30 years and there is no difference with respect to gender. Swelling and pain are the commonest symptoms. Lytic areas with surrounding sclerosis is the commonest radiological finding. Body of the scapula is affected most commonly. Prognosis is excellent with adequate treatment."
