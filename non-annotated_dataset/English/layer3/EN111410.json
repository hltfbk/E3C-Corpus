  "text": "An 85-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with advanced squamous cell lung cancer. The patient was treated with 200 mg pembrolizumab every three weeks as first-line therapy. Routine examination including thyroid function, complete blood count, serum cortisol and sodium levels before each pembrolizumab infusion had shown no significant changes up to the eighth cycle. However, 8 days after the eighth cycle of single-agent pembrolizumab, she presented with rapidly worsening general fatigue and appetite loss over two days. Laboratory data revealed a low serum cortisol level (0.92 μg/dL) with inappropriately low ACTH (8.3 pg/mL), hyponatremia (122 mmol/L) and hypoglycemia (68 mg/dL). Standard-dose short ACTH testing showed an unsatisfactory cortisol response, indicating adrenal insufficiency. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse substantial gadolinium enhancement, T2 hyperintensity, loss of pituitary bright spot, but no pituitary enlargement. Serum cortisol and ACTH levels were low throughout the day, and urinary free cortisol excretion fell below the lower normal limit. There was no ACTH and cortisol response in the corticotropin-releasing hormone test, despite significant responses of other anterior pituitary hormones to their corresponding challenge tests. Thus, isolated ACTH deficiency was diagnosed, and hypophysitis was suspected as the etiology. After administration of 15 mg/day hydrocortisone, the patient's debilitation, hyponatremia, and hypoglycemia swiftly disappeared."
