  "text": "An 81 year old Caucasian female presented with a blocked suprapubic catheter 3 weeks after passage under cystoscopic guidance. The Foley catheter was replaced and attempted aspiration brought up a faeculent fluid. There were no signs to suggest peritonitis. Catheter was kept in situ until computed tomography imaging was obtained; this illustrated the catheter in small bowel with balloon inflated, causing partial small bowel obstruction. Patient underwent exploratory laparotomy with bowel resection, with an uneventful post-operative recovery."
