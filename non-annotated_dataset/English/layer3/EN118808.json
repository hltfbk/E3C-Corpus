  "text": "We presented here a case of a young, 30 year old, Caucasian woman who presented to Emergency Ward with severe chest pain, ECG and enzyme profile typical for acute myocardial infarction. Chest X-ray displayed high intensity shades in the left lung field, which after additional laboratory tests were shown to be due to active pulmonary tuberculosis."
