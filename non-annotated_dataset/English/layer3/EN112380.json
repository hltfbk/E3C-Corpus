  "text": "A 24-year-old nulligravid patient recently diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma [CRC] underwent ovarian transposition prior to radiation. After radiation and chemotherapy, she began in vitro fertilization [IVF] by reproductive endocrinology and infertility physicians. Right ovary demonstrated nonviability due to failed transposition and radiation. Left ovarian oocytes were not able to be harvested due to risk of left kidney puncture via transvaginal ultrasound [TVUS]. Interventional Radiology [IR] was involved and performed a transabdominal ultrasound guided egg retrieval which led to successful IVF."
