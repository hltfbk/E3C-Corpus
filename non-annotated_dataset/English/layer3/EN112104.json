  "text": "We report a case of an ectopic pancreas located in a giant mediastinal cyst in a 2-year old girl who presented with severe dyspnoea due to external compression of the intra-thoracic structures, mainly the right main bronchus. Surgical resection was carried out with complete relief of symptoms. The cyst was confirmed histopathologically to contain pancreatic tissue. Literature review showed that this is an uncommon presentation hence the need to report the case."
