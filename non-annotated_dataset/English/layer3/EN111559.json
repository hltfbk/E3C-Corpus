  "text": "A 29â€‰year-old female complained of a slowly-growing superfacial neck mass for 6 months. MRI revealed a high possibility of schwannoma. Although the patient underwent successfully surgical removal of the tumor, ipsilateral numbness of both auricle and peripheral skin developed due to traction of the nerve. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed the diagnosis of schwannoma. And the patient has been followed regularly."
