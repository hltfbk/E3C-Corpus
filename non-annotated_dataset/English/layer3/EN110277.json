  "text": "A 40-years-old female presented with 3-months history of right breast pain.\nHer past and family histories were unremarkable.\nPhysical examination revealed an overlapping mass on the lateral quadrants of the right breast at 9 O'clock, firm and well defined, mobile, with no modification of the skin above and no axillary lymph nodes.\nMammography showed a voluminous, well-delineated, multilobular and radiolucent mass, with thin peripheral capsule, overlapping the lateral quadrants of the right breast consistent with lipoma.\nWithin, we noticed a central mass-like area showing irregular ill-defined margins with coarse, stippled and curvilinear calcifications creating the aspect of lucent \"bubbles\"or \"eggshell calcifications\" in the breast parenchyma, which corresponds to central fat necrosis.\nUltrasonography (USG) showed a hypoechoic mass with well-defined lobulated margins and posterior shadowing consistent with central calcifications.\nLipoma with central fat necrosis is considered; surgical excision of the mass and pathology examination confirmed the diagnosis."
