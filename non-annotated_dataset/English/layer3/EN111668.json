  "text": "A 28-years-old woman in the 26th week of gestation diagnosed with FLT3/ITD-mutated AML, complete remission was induced by Daunorubicin and Cytarabine, and subsequently with 5-azacytidine (75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days) with no fetal hematological or toxicity issues. Fetal ultrasound showed no aberrant morphology. Fetal size below the 5th percentile with normal umbilical artery dopplers, normal middle cerebral artery dopplers and ductus venosus doppler. Three weeks post 5-azacytidine, the team determined the most appropriate time for delivery after balancing the risks of prematurity and prevention of disease relapse since patient in hematological remission. The patient underwent elective lower segment caesarian section and had a baby girl delivered at 35 weeks of gestation weighing 1670 g without apparent anomalies."
