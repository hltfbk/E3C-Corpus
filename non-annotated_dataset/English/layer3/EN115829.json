  "text": "The proband was a 17 year-old girl. She presented diabetes mellitus, optic neuropathy, intestinal ulcers, sensorineural hearing loss, and defective platelet aggregation to ADP. Genetic testing showed a novel homozygous intragenic deletion of CISD2 in the proband. Her brother and parents carried the heterozygous mutation and were apparently healthy, although they showed subclinical defective platelet aggregation. Long runs of homozygosity analysis from SNP-array data did not show any degree of parental relationship, but the microsatellite analysis confirmed the hypothesis of a common ancestor."
