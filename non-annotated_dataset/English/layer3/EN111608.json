  "text": "A 37-year-old man with a history of hypertension presented to our department on an emergency basis because of a sudden dizziness and left limb weakness. Cerebral computed tomography (CT) suggested ICH in the occipital and parietal lobes, and the chosen emergency treatment was hematoma evacuation. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction occurred after the next 48 h and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. CCS was suspected first in the context of ICH due to the negative result of the coronary CT angiogram."
