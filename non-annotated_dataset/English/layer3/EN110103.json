  "text": "A 23years old male patient presented to the gastroenterologist with complaints of off and on pain in his abdomen since last 6 months. Pain was not localized to one site. It varied to different sites at different times like epigastrium, midabdomen and pelvis and was mild to moderate in severity. He was diagnosed as a case of peritoneal disease on ultrasonography at some local hospital. He had past history of road side accident and splenic injury and underwent splenectomy for that. Now he was admitted with the above complaints and was referred to our department for further work-up.\nOn ultrasonography, multiple well defined, round to oval, solid, homogenous lesions of different sizes were found in left lumbar region, in omental fat anteriorly and in the pelvis in rectovesical pouch. No calcification was seen in the lesions. No other positive finding was there in the abdomen. Further contrast enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) was done, which revealed homogenous significant enhancement in these lesions. Additional lesion was found in the root of mesentery on CT, (not shown). A provisional diagnosis of abdominal splenosis was considered in view of previous history of splenic trauma and surgery. 99m Tc-labeled heat-denatured erythrocyte scintigraphy was done which confirmed the diagnosis by showing uptake in these lesions."
