  "text": "We report on a 52-year-old patient diagnosed as non small cell lung cancer harboring echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion gene. His performance status was 4 because of severe respiratory failure. We treated this patient with alectinib as the first line therapy. Dramatic response was obtained and his performance status improved from 4 to 1 without severe adverse events."
