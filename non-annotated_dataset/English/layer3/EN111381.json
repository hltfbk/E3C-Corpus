  "text": "A 56-year-old male with a history of intermittent claudication was admitted for evaluating the sudden onset of chest pain. Elevated serum troponin level, sustained high D-dimer level, ST-T wave changes on electrocardiogram, and segmental wall motion abnormality of the left ventricle on transthoracic echocardiography were noted. Pulmonary Computed Tomography Angiogram revealed multiple acute emboli. Aortic Computed Tomography Angiogram spotted complete obstructions of the subrenal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries with collateral circulation, maintaining the vascularization of internal and external iliac arteries. We stated the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism and Leriche syndrome and initiated oral anticoagulation. However, Q waves on electrocardiogram and wall motion abnormality on echocardiography persisted after embolus dissolved successfully. Coronary computed tomography angiogram found coronary arterial plaques while myocardial Positron Emission Tomography detected decreased viable myocardium of the left ventricle. We subsequently ratified the diagnosis of concurrent acute pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, and Leriche syndrome. The patient was discharged and has been followed up at our center."
