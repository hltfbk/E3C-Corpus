  "text": "A 41-year-old white male presented with decreased vision in his right eye. Fundus evaluation showed findings consistent with circumscribed choroidal hemangioma. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography revealed a large serous retinal detachment overlying the tumor with an intact photoreceptor layer. The patient underwent photodynamic therapy and a repeat tomography scan confirmed the resolution of serous detachment with return of normal foveal contour."
