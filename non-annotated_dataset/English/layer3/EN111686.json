  "text": "A 52-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a history of intermittent cough for 27 months and recurrent wheezing for 17 months. He had been diagnosed with asthma prior to admission and was responsive to oral prednisone (30 mg/day, with gradual tapering). Bronchoscopy performed 2 years prior to admission showed tracheal and bronchial mucosal hyperemia, edema, and miliary nodules. Pathological tests showed chronic inflammation with focal lymphocytic infiltration in the bronchial mucosa. The patient had recurrent cough and wheezing after prednisone was stopped or the dose reduced. At the time of admission to our hospital, his serum immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) level had increased to 7.35 g/L. Following bronchoscopy, the IgG4 expression in the bronchial mucosa was compared with that observed during the last two bronchoscopies. Bronchoscopy performed 7 months prior to admission revealed IgG4+ plasma cell infiltration in the bronchial tissue, with > 10 IgG4+ plasma cells per high power field and an IgG4+/IgG+ cell ratio of > 40%. The current bronchoscopy revealed a decrease in IgG4 expression in the bronchial tissue, probably because of the intermittent prednisone treatment. The case fulfilled the comprehensive clinical diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD. He received prednisone and azathioprine, and he has never developed recurrence."
