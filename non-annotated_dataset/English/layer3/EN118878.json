  "text": "An 82-year old woman presented with acute retrosternal pain indicative of cardiac etiology. Physical examination and biochemical tests, as well as 12-lead electrocardiogram, were normal. A two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram was performed and revealed a structure that was considered to represent a left atrial mass. A subsequent computed tomography scan visualized a hiatus hernia in the posterior mediastinum, impinging on the posterior left atrial wall. The intrathoracic displacement of a large part of the stomach was further confirmed by an upper gastrointestinal barium examination."
