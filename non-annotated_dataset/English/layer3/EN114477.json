  "text": "We report the case of a 43 year-old latin female, with a 2-year history of chronic anemia requiring blood transfusion. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit count were low, therefore further studies were required to rule out bleeding sources or other causes of anemia. Enteroscopy findings showed a 35 mm lesion taking up 50 % of the circumference in the distal duodenum, with raised whitish edges secondary to confluent lymphangiectasia, a center with a vascular appearance and active bleeding spots. Biopsy samples dyed with India ink confirmed the diagnosis of hemangiolymphangioma."
