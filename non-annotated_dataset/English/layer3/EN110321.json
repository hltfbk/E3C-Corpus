  "text": "A 59-year-old man suffering for 9 months of epigastric pain, retro-sternal burns and vomiting. This symptomatology is relieved by proton pump inhibitors. The patient had similar episodes in the past that were treated with Cimetidine for a suspected duodenal ulcer without endoscopic control. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with mild tenderness in the epigastrium. Biological examinations reveal leukocytosis (12500 cells / mm 3) with 80% neutrophils without cholestasis and hepatic cytolysis. The abdominal ultrasound showed pneumobilia (the presence of air in the biliary tree) in the absence of dilation of the biliary tract. There were no stones in the gallbladder. Oeso-gastroduodenal endoscopy revealed a duodenal bulb ulcer with erythematous lesions all around. X-barium meal confirmed the existence of a CDF by objectifying a simultaneous opacification of the biliary tract. The diagnosis of CDF due to a bulb peptic ulcer was retained. The decision was to manage the patient conservatively. We opted for an anti-ulcer medical treatment. The evolution was eventful with a clear improvement of the initial symptomatology. An oeso-gastroduodenal endoscopy performed after two months of medical treatment confirm the disappearance of the duodenal ulcer and the choledochoduodenal fistula. The patient remains asymptomatic after 1-year follow-up."
