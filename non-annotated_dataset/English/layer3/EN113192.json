  "text": "At the age of 44 years, the patient developed acute kidney injury and purpura on the lower extremities with type II cryoglobulinemia after interferon therapy for hepatitis C virus. Cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis was suspected; however, despite immunosuppressive therapy combined with plasmapheresis, she eventually needed hemodialysis treatment. She was referred to us at the age of 49 years for renal transplantation. Cryocrit was 14% and the organ manifestations persisted, including the lower extremity purpura and neurologic symptoms. After monitoring and confirming sufficient suppression of cryoglobulin concentration by immunosuppressive treatment with prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab combined with plasmapheresis, the operation was performed. After transplantation, the cryoglobulin concentration was continuously monitored, and plasmapheresis and rituximab infusion were performed as appropriate. Her graft function has remained stable for 2 years and 6 months."
