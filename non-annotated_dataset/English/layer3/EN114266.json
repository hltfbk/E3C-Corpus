  "text": "A 40-year-old female patient came in Ortho. OPD with complaints of pain, cold algesia, and point tenderness on the radial side of base of the nailbed of left little finger for the last 6 months. Diagnosis was delayed despite the patient having sought the advice from different clinicians a number of times before coming to us. Pain used to occur on accidental touching of tender spot, cold water immersion; excruciating at times, making the patient faint. On physical examination clinical diagnosis of glomus tumor was made, which was confirmed on MRI as the plain X-ray was non-contributory."
