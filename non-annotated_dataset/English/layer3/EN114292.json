  "text": "A 65-year-old man with HCM complained of palpitations. Twelve-lead electrocardiogram showed narrow QRS tachycardia with 2:1 atrioventricular conduction. Two sessions of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were required to eliminate all left ATs. In the first session, 3-dimensional electroanatomical mapping fused with the image constructed by multi-detector computed tomography showed a clockwise macroreentrant AT (AT1) associated with a low-voltage or dense scar area located along the aorta-LA contiguous area. AT1 was eliminated by RFA to the narrow isthmus with slow conduction velocity within the scar. Additional ATs (AT2-AT4) occurred 1 month after the first ablation. In the second session, AT2 and AT3 were identified as focal ATs with centrifugal propagation and few accompanying fragmentations, and AT4 as a macroreentrant AT with features similar to AT1. AT2 and AT3 were successfully eliminated by performing RFA to the earliest activation site, and AT4 was terminated by performing RFA to the narrow isthmus with slow conduction velocity. No ATs have recurred for 11 months after these RFAs. Interestingly, the substrate for all left ATs was associated with the aorta-LA contiguous area."
