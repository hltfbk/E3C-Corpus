  "text": "A 42-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital due to chest pain and syncope. Coronary angiography showed acute LM occlusion. Following thrombus aspiration, a LM bifurcation lesion remained. Coronary angiography was repeated one week later, and at the same time, 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) was carried out to better show the geometry of the bifurcation, which confirmed that the stenosis in the ostial left circumflex artery was caused by a long carina. After assessment of the plaque characteristics and the minimum lumen area, the cross-over strategy, kissing balloon inflation and proximal optimization technique were chosen to treat the bifurcation lesion. A \"moving\" carina was found twice during the intervention. Good stent apposition and expansion were confirmed by OCT after proximal optimization technique. The three-month follow-up showed good recovery and normal cardiac function."
