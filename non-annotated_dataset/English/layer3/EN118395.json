  "text": "We present a non-smoking, elderly, diabetic man who presented with nonspecific symptoms of generalized weakness without any symptom pertaining to respiratory system. Examination of chest revealed findings suggestive of right lower lobe mass. On evaluation, he was found to have a well circumscribed lung mass on chest radiograph. Computerized tomography of chest with contrast showed a large mass involving right lung and multiple nodules in both lungs. For diagnosis, biopsy from right lung mass was done under image guidance. Histopathology revealed diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Evaluation for primary malignancy leading to lung metastases was inconclusive. Patient was advised chemotherapy."
