  "text": "A 39-year-old male was transferred to our hospital from another hospital complaints of progressive abdominal distension and severe weakness. In the previous hospital, he was diagnosed with \"adult megacolon\" and was recommended for surgical treatment. In our hospital, he was diagnosed with delayed bowel obstruction due to seat belt injury and underwent surgical intervention. Following laparoscopic adhesiolysis and resection of the narrow small intestine, his symptoms improved rapidly, and he was discharged."
