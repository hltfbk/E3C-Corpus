  "text": "We describe a patient from Sri Lanka that was referred for genetic assessment at 4 years of age due to subtle facial dysmorphism and expressive language impairment. She was diagnosed with Potocki-Lupski syndrome through multiplex ligation probe amplification. She carried two duplications; one in 17p11.2 consistent with Potocki-Lupski, and one in Xq including the region for X-linked intellectual disability."
