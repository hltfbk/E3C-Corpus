  "text": "A 68-year-old male presented with ataxia, and was diagnosed with tumor-like primary angiitis of the central nervous system. The patient underwent Intravenous drip glucocorticoid therapy (10 mg of dexamethasone, daily). After 10 days, the symptoms of the patient were completely relieved. Radiology revealed that the low density lesion in the right cerebellar hemisphere obviously narrowed. Cyclophosphamide therapy was not initiated."
