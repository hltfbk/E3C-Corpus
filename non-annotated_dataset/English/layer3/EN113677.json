  "text": "We present a case of a road traffic accident with right lower limb monoplegia. On careful examination, a thin transverse fracture line was noticed in D5 vertebral body, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed posterior ligamentous disruption extending in line with the transverse fracture line in D5 vertebral body which confirmed the diagnosis of a Chance fracture. Fracture was stabilized by pedicle screw fixation from D4 to D7 level, and decompression was done at D5 level. By the end of 7 months, patient regained Grade 4 power in the right hip and knee joints, with Grade 5 power in the right ankle and great toe."
