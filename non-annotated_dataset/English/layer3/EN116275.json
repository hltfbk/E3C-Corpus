  "text": "A 44-year-old female patient presented to us with acute abdominal pain associated with recurrent vomiting and giddiness. On examination, her blood pressure was 80/50 mm Hg. Systemic examination was normal. Further evaluation revealed hypocortisolemia with elevated plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone indicative of primary adrenal insufficiency. Her abdominal computed tomography scan showed features of evolving bilateral adrenal infarction. Etiological work-up revealed prolonged activated thromboplastin time, which didn't correct with normal plasma, her anti-cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant were also positive. She was diagnosed to have APS with adrenal insufficiency and she was started on intravenous steroids and heparin infusion."
