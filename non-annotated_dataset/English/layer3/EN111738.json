  "text": "The patient is a 26-year-old Chinese woman who has been suffering from knee pain since the age of 8 years, 2-3 episodes a year. Three years ago, due to the practice of advanced yoga poses, the frequency of left knee pain increased, requiring prompt medical treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an absence of both anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments of both knees with abnormal posterior tilting of the tibial plateau. Bilateral subluxation of the knee joint was also found, therefore tibial osteotomy was performed. The patient reported at the 24 mo follow-up that the frequency of pain and instability had been reduced and function restored."
