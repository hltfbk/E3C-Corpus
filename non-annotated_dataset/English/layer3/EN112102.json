  "text": "A 10-year-old boy from consanguineous parents presented with a history of progressive truncal instability, gait difficulty, and frequent falls for 2 months. He had dystonia, rigidity, ataxia, dysarthria, bradykinesia and a plethoric skin. Investigations showed polycythemia, low serum iron and ferritin levels, and increased total iron binding capacity. A brain MRI revealed symmetric hyperintensities in the basal ganglia and dentate nucleuses on TI images that were suggestive of brain metal deposition together with clinical manifestations. Serum calcium and copper levels were normal, while the manganese level was significantly higher than normal values. There was no history of environmental overexposure to manganese. Genetic testing showed a homozygous missense mutation in SLC30A10 (c.C1006T, p.His336Tyr) and Sanger sequencing confirmed a homozygous state in the proband and a heterozygous state in the parents. Regular treatment with monthly infusions of disodium calcium edetate and oral iron compounds resulted in decreased serum manganese and hemoglobin levels to normal values, significant resolution of MRI lesions, and partial improvement of neurological symptoms during 6 months of follow-up."
