  "text": "We present the case of an 80-year-old indigenous Australian man with an unusual presentation of metastatic carcinoma of the lung. The case demonstrated a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung with an intracranial metastatic lesion destroying the parietal bone and extending into the extracranial soft tissue. A visible deformity as a result of the metastasis was evident on physical examination and computed tomography demonstrated extensive bone destruction."
