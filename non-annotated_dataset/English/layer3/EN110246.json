  "text": "The patient was a 67-year-old female with a good life quality, who presented an unstable intertrochanteric fracture of his left femur, Kyle and Gustilo type III following a fall at home. She underwent surgical fixation of his fracture with a short trochanteric Gamma nail, with a cervico diaphyseal angle of 130ยบ and a distal diameter of 11 mm. The cephalic screw was 90 mm long; proximal static locking was performed. Postoperative radiographs showed acceptable reduction of the fracture.\nFour months later, the patient started complaining of permanent pain in his left hip, which became more severe over a few days, resulting in complete disability. He did not recall any trauma or unusual efforts. On physical examination, there was pain on palpation of the left trochanter as well as on mobilisation, particularly in rotation. The surgical wound was unremarkable.\nRadiographs showed breakage of the nail, at the opening for the cervical screw, resulting in an angulation between the nail and the cephalic screw. The fracture showed no signs of healing; the fracture line was still visible, with sclerosis ofthe bone ends, typical for a nonunion.\nThe broken nail was removed and a DCS plate screw was implanted with bone graft levied from the iliac crest. Early weight-bearing was encouraged. All bacteriological samples taken were sterile. Two months later, radiographs showed healing of the fracture. The patient is presently asymptomatic, walking without help."
