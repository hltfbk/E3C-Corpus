  "text": "We report an immunocompromised patient who developed chronic HEV infection despite the presence of high level antibodies. HEV infection was detected using RT-PCR upon diagnostic evaluation due to increased liver enzymes. Upon retrospective analysis of stored serum samples we found that the patient was HEV RNA positive since 7â€‰months. Chronic HEV infection was successfully treated with ribavirin."
