  "text": "A previously disease-free five-year-old boy presented with a three-week history of redness, swelling, and ulceration of the left earlobe. An ulcer had developed at the helix and lobule of the ear a few days after symptom onset. The patient was treated using topical corticosteroids, and the size of the ulcer improved; however, the redness and pain persisted. After three months, lesions started to appear on his right ear, exhibiting the same painful redness and ulceration. Once again, topical steroids were prescribed, but the response was minimal and slow for both ears. As the lesions persisted and no improvement followed the use of oral and topical antibiotics or topical steroids, the patient was seen by a dermatologist and then referred to a pediatric rheumatologist. The patient had no history of fever, skin rash, preceding infection, trauma, or food or drug allergies. He had no respiratory or musculoskeletal symptoms and, upon other systemic reviews, was found to be medically unremarkable. His family and social history were negative for any genetic or autoimmune disease. The clinical findings at the time of evaluation by the pediatric rheumatologist indicated that the patient was looking well, an alert child with a good body build, afebrile with normal vital signs. Upon local examination of his ear, nose, and throat (ENT), significant redness and erosive wounds were found in both ears, though more on the left side. The ears were tender, and the rest of the ENT examination was normal. Cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and central nervous system examinations were clinically normal. Laboratory examinations revealed a white blood cell count of 8.95 × 109/L (normal), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 32 (slightly elevated), negative C-reactive protein, negative antinuclear antibody, negative Leishmania antibody immunoglobulin M, and complement within normal ranges. The antibodies of Type II collagen were not available at our center. A chest computerized tomography (CT) scan was done to rule out respiratory tract involvements, and the results were normal. The patient was screened by the otorhinolaryngology and ophthalmology departments for the involvement of other sites, and these findings were normal. Also, the joint and cardiac evaluations via echocardiogram were negative. Treatment was discussed with the patient's family, and they refused a corticosteroid, so the patient was started on an NSAID (10 mg/kg of ibuprofen every eight hours for six weeks). The patient showed improvement from the fourth week of treatment, with healing of the lesions and disappearance of the redness along with minimal remanence. After six weeks of treatment, he completely recovered, and all inflammatory markers-mainly ESR-normalized."
