  "text": "We present a 52-year-old woman with a slow-growing lesion on her right flank, which developed over 12 months. On examination, we observed a large exophytic, easily bleeding tumour on the right flank, that resembled amelanotic malignant melanoma. Histologic analysis after complete excision of the lesion confirmed a pyogenic granuloma of the lobular capillary hemangioma subtype. In the present case masquerading of the lesion went to the better site after histologic investigations despite the delay of diagnosis caused by the patients."
