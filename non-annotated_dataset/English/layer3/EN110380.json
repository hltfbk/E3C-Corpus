  "text": "A 49-year-old male with a psychiatric history of an acute psychotic episode at age of 35 years treated with classic antipsychotic drug (Haloperidol). Three years later, the patient was admitted to a psychiatric ward for behavioral disorders with delirium of erotomania and persecution through an interpretive and intuitive mechanism with confusion. The brain scan showed cortical and subcortical atrophy. Clinical and biological exams were without abnormalities. A diagnostic presumption of Alzheimer's disease was made and the patient was treated with high-doses of antipsychotic drugs with vitamin therapy and vasodilator treatment. He has a follow-up at the outpatient psychiatric consults. His family described a cognitive decline and variation in psychotic symptoms with a progressive limitation of his self-reliance and he would have ceased all professional activities with social withdrawal.\nCurrently, ten years later, he was hospitalized in a stuporous state associated with food refusal, sustained posture and worsening of his overall situation. At the mental assessment, the patient was motionless, mute and rigid with frozen facial expression and gaze stare. Negativity and opposition were obvious against any solicitation. It was hard to make any contact because of nodding or blinking answers. Moreover, the physical examination has shown a worsening of the overall state of health with marked weight loss and walking difficulties. After symptomatic treatment of catatonia with benzodiazepine (Lorazepam) and vitamin therapy, the assessment revealed an aphaso-apraxo-agnotic syndrome associated with memory dysfunctions such as anterograde and retrograde amnesia with false recognition and executive dysfunction as well as limitations in intellectual abilities (acalculia, lack of abstraction). A brain scan revealed cortical and subcortical atrophy predominant in the bilateral fronto-temporo-parietal region associated with ventricular system expansion. Biological tests and serologies were normal. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was made. Following atypical antipsychotic treatment combined with benzodiazepine, there was relative stabilization with release of inhibition, improvement of contact and recovery of appetite. However, the patient remained reliant on a caregiver and there was a significant cognitive decline with a loss of memory, executive and instrumental functions."
