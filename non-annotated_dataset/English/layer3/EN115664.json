  "text": "This case report describes a 58-year-old Caucasian woman who is a cigarette smoker with a 10-week history of fever of unknown origin, night sweats and weight loss of 12 kg. Initially, clinical presentation was suspicious of malignant disease. Laboratory findings detected significantly elevated inflammatory blood parameters including C-reactive protein and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (110 mm/hour). Extensive diagnostic workup including microbiological and rheumatological assessment, ultrasonography, endoscopy and computed tomography of abdomen and thorax did not indicate any septic or malignant focus. Eventually, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography was able to reveal arteritis of her aortic arch and supraaortic branches. Subsequently, she commenced steroid and methotrexate therapy that led to sustained remission."
