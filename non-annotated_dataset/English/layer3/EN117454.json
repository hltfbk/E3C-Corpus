  "text": "We report a laparoscopic technique of whole-ovary removal without coagulation using Endo-GIA forceps and clips. Laparoscopic ovariectomy was performed for cryopreservation in a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with breast cancer and for whom chemotherapy was planned. The procedure was completed quickly and without complication. This Endo-GIA procedure was of short duration with a short period of ischemia before freezing."
