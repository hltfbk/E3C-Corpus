  "text": "I report a 53-year-old alcoholic man, who was admitted due to epigastric pain. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a huge ulcer lesion in the stomach, which was suspected to be gastric cancer. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18 FDG PET/CT) showed diffusely intense FDG uptake at the ulcer lesion of the stomach, and several enlarged hypermetabolic lymph nodes were noted at the left gastric chain. Although, endoscopy and F-18 FDG PET/CT findings suggested advanced gastric cancer with regional lymph node metastases, there was no cancer cells in the biopsy results and multiple fungal hyphae were noted in the periodic acid-Schiff stained image."
