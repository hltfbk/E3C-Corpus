  "text": "A 10 years old Arab Libyan boy, seventh of 8 children-family of modest shepherds. While helping his older brothers to keep the sheep, a \"Grad\"-type shell has dropped near them. His brothers fled while he, stunned by the sudden event, did not move from his place. \"I was scared\", he said with a smile on his lips, \"I do not understand why!\" Covered with sand and abandoned by his brothers, the little boy, remained so long; motionless; in the same position until his father, alerted by his brothers of his disappearance, picked him up. After this event, the family decided to leave the country to take refuge in Tunisia. The next day after the incident, the father noticed his son is frequently asking for a drink and going to the toilet to urinate. A few days went by; he began to quickly loose weight despite of eating almost all the time. One week after the event, the patient was brought by his father to a paediatric consultation in our medical and surgical field hospital. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was made the next day morning to 430 mg/dl (23.86 mmol/l) and haemoglobin A1C levels at the 14%. A family survey (since the whole family had taken refuge) revealed no familial cases of diabetes, nor similar cases of T1D. The diagnosis of T1D was retained; the boy was put on insulin-therapy, and then redirected to our tent for a psychiatric care. During the psychiatric examination, the boy was very cooperative. He presented no difficulty in sleeping or a repetition syndrome (characteristic of post-traumatic stress), but rather a change in character reported by his father apparent in: Irritability, aggression and a constant search to dominate his peers and brothers. On top of that, and in contradiction with his usual character where he spent days in desert with his grandfather and his brothers keeping camels, it became difficult for him to leave home, and refused any hospitalization for assessment purpose, even short and accompanied. He had good school grades before the events but his level cannot be evaluated after because the refugees were in forced vacation. He bought a plastic gun to play with, “it is to kill Gaddafi” he said, aware of his disease, he continues “it was he who put sugar on my blood by his”jrad ”. The diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was withheld and the patient received psychotherapy alone, especially because the chemotherapy prescription was refused by the family for cultural reasons (makes him look mad, frowned upon by the environment...)."
