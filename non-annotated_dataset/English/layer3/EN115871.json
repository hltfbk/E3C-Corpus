  "text": "An eighteen year old boy was operated upon for failed plating of right femur. He had a globular swelling in mid thigh. There were no discharging sinuses, no signs/symptoms of infection. While operating on him to remove the failed implant and fix the fracture, while following standard procedures, we found a full size sponge embedded in the fracture site."
