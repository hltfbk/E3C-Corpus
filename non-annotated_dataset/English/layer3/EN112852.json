  "text": "The treated patient is a 20-year-old girl who has undergone shoulder arthroscopy after recurrent dislocations. 2 years after the surgery, another trauma happened, and the shoulder was dislocated again along with a broken piece of the bone. The patient decided instead of open surgery to do acupuncture treatment. 10 treatments were done, 3 with fire needle and 7 with normal needle acupuncture in 5 months. The patient was also taking Glucosamine and Calcitriol and was advised to rest the arm, not to bore it, not to lift weight and not to make sudden movements. Less than a year, the results are amazing, there's no pain in the shoulder, the movement is unlimited and eased. The MRI image is with normal findings with a little piece of 3 mm still to heal on the broken part."
