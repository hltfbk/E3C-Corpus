  "text": "We describe the kidney biopsy findings of two patients who had recent diagnoses of COVID-19 and presented with new-onset nephrotic syndrome. Renal biopsy in both patients showed ATI (as in previous reports) and distinct glomerular findings on light microscopy - that of minimal change disease (MCD) initially in one patient followed by CG in a subsequent biopsy and CG at the outset in the other patient. The electron microscopic findings in both patients were that of severe podocytopathy (diffuse and severe podocyte foot process effacement)."
