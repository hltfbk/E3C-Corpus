  "text": "We report a case of a 59-year-old Egyptian man who presented with symptoms suggestive of intestinal obstruction. On examination, he was afebrile with distended tender abdomen with no obvious hernias. There was no history of previous abdominal surgery. Laboratory investigations were within normal range except for elevated serum creatinine levels. Plain erect X-ray and computed tomography scan of his abdomen indicated mechanical small bowel obstruction. Preoperative preparations with administration of intravenously administered fluids and antibiotics were done for exploratory laparotomy. The operation was approached through a midline incision, revealing dilated small bowel loops with a terminal ileal loop occluded by a ring of his appendix. The appendicular tip was adherent to small bowel mesentery by adhesive band (appendiceal tourniquet). Release of the band with simple appendectomy was done; a segment of ileal bowel loop was congested but regained its viability after 5 minutes' application of gauze soaked in warm saline. His abdomen was closed in layers and one drainage tube left in situ. Paralytic ileus was the only postoperative complication which was relieved after 2 days. He was started on orally administered fluids on the third postoperative day, and discharged on the fifth postoperative day."
