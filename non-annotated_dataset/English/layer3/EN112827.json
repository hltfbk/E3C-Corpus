  "text": "A 13-year-old healthy girl sustained an extensor mechanism injury after the left knee hyperflexion during a fall from skateboarding. On examination, the extensor mechanism was not functional against gravity. Radiographic imaging revealed a displaced tibial tubercle fracture with patella alta, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a concomitant patellar tendon avulsion from the tubercle. From a supine position on a radiolucent table, under general anesthesia and a femoral nerve block, the tibial tubercle fracture was fixed using two fully-threaded cortical screws. The patellar tendon was repaired with Fiber Wire through the Krakow method and secured through a tibial transosseous tunnel. A supplemental Fiber Wire was passed through a patellar tunnel and into a tibial tunnel to mitigate tension on the tendon repair. Post-operative knee motion was limited for 1 week to 60Â° of passive flexion, and full weight-bearing was permitted in a knee immobilizer."
