  "text": "Herein, we reported a case of HCV-infection in a 46-year-old man with benign prostatic hypertrophy. The patient received sofosbuvir/velpatasvir as well as methadone maintenance therapy for drug abuse. The viral load became negative at week 1 post treatment. He developed facial and bilateral lower extremity edema 48 h after starting receiving tamsulosin. Edema disappeared 10 d after treatment with oral furosemide and spironolactone."
