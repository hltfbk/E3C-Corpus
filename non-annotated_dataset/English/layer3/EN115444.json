  "text": "A 68-year-old woman presented with worsening dysphagia that had started six months after the resection of a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung in 2011. An extensive work-up in 2012, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy, chest computed tomography and positron emission tomography, was unremarkable. Esophageal manometries revealed findings characteristic of achalasia. A repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy in January of 2014 revealed a nearly circumferential ulcerated, fungating mass in her distal esophagus. Biopsy results confirming a recurrence of her large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma."
