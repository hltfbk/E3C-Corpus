  "text": "A 17-year old Sri Lankan male (body weight--42 kg), presented to a local hospital 1 hour after self-ingestion of nearly 500 ml (4.3 g/kg) of liquid Propanil (concentration--360 g/l). On admission he had dizziness and peripheral cyanosis. He was given intravenous methylene blue (1 mg/kg) within one hour of admission, which was repeated subsequently due to minimal response. The next day morning, (18 hours after poisoning) the patient was transferred to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) for further management. On admission to NHSL, he was drowsy and confused, had a shallow respiratory effort and marked central and peripheral cyanosis. Respiratory rate was 20/min, with a pulse-oximetry of 77% on room air. The arterial blood gas analysis was as follows; pH--7.24, HCO3(-)--12 mmol/l, pCO2--28 mmHg, pO2--239 mmHg and O2 saturation--100%. Exchange transfusion was commenced within two hours of admission to NHSL. A dramatic improvement in oxygen saturation was observed immediately afterwards, with the saturation in pulse-oximetry rising to >95%. The level of consciousness and respiratory effort also improved. He was discharged subsequently 8 days after the initial poisoning."
