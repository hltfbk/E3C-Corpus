  "text": "Two siblings presented with isolated skeletal manifestations of MFS, including severe pectus excavatum, elongated face, scoliosis in one case, and absence of other clinical features according to Ghent criteria diagnosis, were screened for detection of variants in whole FBN1 gene (65 exons). Both individuals were heterozygous for the R2726W variant. This variant has been previously reported in association with some skeletal features of Marfan syndrome in the absence of both tall stature and non-skeletal features. These features are consistent with the presentation of the siblings reported here."
