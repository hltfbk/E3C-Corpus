  "text": "A 41-year-old man presented with a massive hemorrhage in the oral cavity due to an arteriovenous malformation involving the left hemiface and tongue. Under conscious sedation, selective angiography was followed by endovascular embolization with a mixture of n-butyl-cyanoacrylate-methacryloxy-sulfolane (NBCA-MS) with Lipiodol. The hemorrhage was successfully arrested, but the procedure was complicated with a reflux of embolic material from the right external carotid artery into the common carotid, caused by strong unexpected coughing. Non-target embolization was confirmed by emergency CT and subsequent MRI. After initial neurological impairment, the patient recovered fully and was discharged after one week. No sequelae were confirmed by 9-months follow-up with CT and MRI. We describe technical aspects, multimodality imaging, clinical presentation, and follow-up of this peculiar case."
