  "text": "We report the case of 23 years old man, with a history of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome since childhood treated by corticosteroids. He was admitted at emergency department for acute pain of his both lower limbs. There was no history of immobilization or recent diuretic therapy. Physical examination revealed a coldness and pulseless of both lower limbs (abolished bilateral popliteal and distal pulses). His blood pressure was 130/80mmHg, cardiac and lung examination were unremarkable. Renal function test, electrolytes, complete blood count and coagulation parameters were normal. Serum albumin and total protein were markedly decreased; total cholesterol and triglycerides levels were elevated. A urine dipstick test was negative for protein. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm. Emergent lower extremity computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed and revealed an occlusion of right popliteal and left superficial femoral arteries. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large thrombus in the apico-septal wall of the left ventricle measuring 40x30x20mm. The ejection fraction of left ventricule was preserved without kinetic abnormalities. Urgent revascularization (fogartisation with embolectomy) of acute lower extremities ischemia was performed, secondly completed by medical therapy consisting of thrombolysis in situ with rTPA and intravenous heparin. The result was successful on the right lower leg while the patient underwent a Transmetatarsal Amputation of left foot. Heparinotherapy was relayed by oral anticoagulation. Repeated echocardiography showed a total dissolution of the thrombosis five weeks later."
