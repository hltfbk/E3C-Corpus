  "text": "In the current case report, we have documented a unique case of invasive aspergillosis presenting as a mass in the hilum and bronchial stenosis under bronchoscopy mimicking lung cancer in a 54-year-old man with diabetes mellitus. The histological analysis of bronchial membrane biopsy demonstrated fungal elements of 45Â° branching hyphae with positive Periodic Acid-Schiff and Grocott staining. After 3 mo of antifungal therapy, the symptoms, computed tomography scan and bronchoscopy manifestations all showed improvement."
