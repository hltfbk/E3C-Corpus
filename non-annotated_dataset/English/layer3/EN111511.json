  "text": "We report the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian woman with no history of thoraco-abdominal surgery or trauma, which accused epigastric pain, starting 2 years prior, pseudo-angina and bloating. Based on imagistic findings the patient was diagnosed with a PHH and an associated type I hiatal hernia. Patient underwent laparoscopic surgery and we found an opening in the diaphragm of 7 cm diameter, lateral to the left crus, through which 40%-50% of the stomach had herniated in the thorax, and a small sliding hiatal hernia with an anatomically intact hiatal orifice but slightly enlarged. We performed closure of the defect, suture hiatoplasty and a \"floppy\" Nissen fundoplication. Postoperative outcome was uneventful, with the patient discharged on the fifth postoperative day. We performed a review of the literature and identified eight articles regarding primary PHH. All data was compiled into one tabled and analyzed."
