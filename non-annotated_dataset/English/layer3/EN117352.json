  "text": "A previously healthy 59-year-old Caucasian man presented with painless rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy revealed a lesion in the ano-rectal junction, with pathological examination demonstrating atypical lymphoid cells consisting primarily of plasmablasts with rounded nuclei, coarse chromatin, small nucleoli and multiple mitotic figures. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the atypical cells were negative for CD45, CD20, CD79a and immunoglobulin light chains, but were strongly positive for CD138 and EBV-encoded RNA. The results were consistent with a diagnosis of plasmablastic lymphoma. Aggressive systemic chemotherapy and involved field radiation therapy resulted in complete clinical and pathological remission."
