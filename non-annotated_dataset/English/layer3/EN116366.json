  "text": "The clinical course of a 15-year-old girl with a traumatic ocular injury after being hit in the eye by an elbow was evaluated. Upon the first examination, the best-corrected visual acuity was 16/20. The findings were subretinal pigment epithelial hemorrhage and vertical choroidal rupture. Three weeks after the trauma, the patient's visual acuity was reduced to counting fingers at 30 cm. On fundus examination and fluorescein angiography subretinal pigment epithelial hemorrhage decreased, while the choroidal rupture expanded; on optical coherence tomography outer retinal changes in the adjacent area were detected."
