  "text": "An eighteen year-old Asian female presented with a three-month history of fluctuating swelling and ptosis of the left upper eyelid. Computed tomography disclosed a distinct homogeneous lesion in the left superior orbit, molding to the globe and other orbital structures. At histopathological evaluation the lesion was composed of numerous blood vessels lined by plump endothelial cells with oval nuclei protruding into the lumen. Surrounding the vessels, there was a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with a large proportion of eosinophils. Based on clinical and histopathological findings, the diagnosis of EH was made."
