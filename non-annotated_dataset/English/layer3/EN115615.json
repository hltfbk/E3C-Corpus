  "text": "The present case refers to a 62 year old Tunisian male admitted in our institution for diffuse abdominal distension. Physical examination was unremarkable except for the presence of ascites. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a large amount of fluid into the peritoneal cavity associated with many intraperitoneal cysts with a scalloping on the liver. It showed also a heterogeneous cystic lesion of the segment II of the liver. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed in addition a fat infiltration and a thickening of the peritoneum. Thus intraperitoneal hydatid cyst rupture was suspected and emergency laparotomy was performed. A yellow serous fluid , containing many daughter vesicles disseminated through the peritoneal cavity was noted. A mass consistent with a hydatid cyst was noted at segment II of the liver with a tear on the inferior surface. Thus, intraperitoneal rupture of hepatic hydatid cyst was diagnosed."
