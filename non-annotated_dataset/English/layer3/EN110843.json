  "text": "We report a patient harboring an 11.56â€‰Mb microdeletion at 13q33.1-34 region, which contains about 30 OMIM genes. Besides the common clinical manifestations such as facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and congenital heart disease, she also suffered from a reduced anogenital distance, hematuria and left renal hypoplasia. Most related cases were characterized by facial deformity and heart defects, but there were few reports on renal malformation, especially regarding renal hypoplasia with hematuria."
