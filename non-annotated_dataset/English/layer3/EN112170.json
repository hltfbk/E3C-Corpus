  "text": "We describe a case of an 83-year-old male presenting with chest pain consistent with acute myocardial infarction. The ECG demonstrated anterior ST elevation with bedside echocardiography showing apical wall motion abnormalities. Cardiac catheterisation found an occluded OM2 branch of the left circumflex artery with ventriculography confirming apical ballooning consistent with takotsubo and not in the vascular territory supplied by the occluded epicardial vessel. Repeat echocardiogram 6 weeks later confirmed resolution of the apical wall motion abnormalities consistent with a diagnosis of takotsubo."
