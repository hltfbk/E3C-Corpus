  "text": "We report on a 44-year-old female with an aspergillosis after liver transplantation for autoimmune hepatitis. On postoperative day (pod) 7, seizures occurred and imaging diagnostics revealed an intracranial lesion. Anidulafungin was initiated in suspicion of mycosis and switched to voriconazole on suspicion of an Aspergillus spp. infection. Progression of the cerebral lesion prompted craniotomy (pod 48) and the aspergillosis was verified. The patient was discharged with oral voriconazole therapy. Re-admission was necessary with acute-on-chronic renal failure after a tacrolimus overdose on pod 130. The patient received a pelvic angiography due to a temperature difference in the legs. It showed a complete iliac artery thrombosis which was subsecutively surgically removed. The histopathological examination revealed an Aspergillus fumigatus conglomerate. The patient died on pod 210 due to systemic aspergillosis."
