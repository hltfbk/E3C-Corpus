  "text": "A 15-year-old Japanese boy presented to hospital with a chief complaint of decreased vision in his right eye. At the initial examination, corrected visual acuity of the right eye was 20/100. On the right fundus, exudative retinal detachment with subretinal haemorrhage was observed from the upper intermediate periphery to the posterior pole. Abnormal telangiectatic vessels and microaneurysms were found at the nasal peripheral retina. From these findings, we diagnosed the case as Coats disease. We conducted photodynamic therapy for the right eye. At 10Â months after treatment, both the subretinal haemorrhage and the exudative retinal detachment had disappeared completely. Further, the retinal structure of the macula had recovered, and right vision had improved to 20/20."
