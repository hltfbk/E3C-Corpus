  "text": "The patient was a 57-year-old woman (body weight, 69 kg) who had taken a single oral dose of 750 mg of edoxaban in a suicide attempt. She was emergently admitted to Kyoto Medical Center. The patient's edoxaban plasma concentrations during ambulance transport (8 h after oral administration) were ~ 4900 ng/ml, and the concentration gradually decreased to ~ 10 ng/mL and to detectable but unmeasurable levels of ~ 1.0 ng/mL at 60 h and 100 h, respectively. The linear range of the relationship between the dose and plasma concentration was assumed to have been exceeded during the first 8 h; however, the measured elimination rate of edoxaban was similar to that visualized curves predicted by a simplified physiologically based pharmacokinetic model previously established."
