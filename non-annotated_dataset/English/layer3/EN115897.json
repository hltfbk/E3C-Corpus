  "text": "A 65-year-old woman with medical history of latent hepatitis B virus infection, repeated choledocholisthiasis, and cholecystitis was admitted due to a heterogeneous cystic mass (5.6 cm × 4 cm) shown on abdominal ultrasonography during regular physical checkup. The patient complained about irregular bowel movements with intermittent diarrhea for two months before presentation. Computed tomography (CT) disclosed a multiloculated cystic lesion in the left hepatic lobe with the presence of intraductal stones and dilatation of intrahepatic ducts. Histological results obtained from left lobectomy specimens showed hepatobiliary cystadenocarcinoma without accompanied mesenchymal stroma."
