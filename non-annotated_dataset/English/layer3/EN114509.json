  "text": "In this report, we present the case of a 50Â year old woman who presented with an abnormal Pap test with atypical squamous and glandular cells. A loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was performed and led to the diagnosis of stage IB1 endocervical adenocarcinoma. Subsequent radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection showed a well-differentiated endocervical adenocarcinoma of usual type with superficial spread to the endometrium and right fallopian tube. The patient received no adjuvant therapy and has remained without evidence of disease."
