His urine analysis and blood investigations revealed evidence of urinary tract infection. After excluding allergic conditions, he was given amoxicillin/clavulanic acid intravenously. About 20 minutes after the first dose he felt severe itching of body, nausea , dizziness and sever retrosternal chest pain. Urgent electrocardiogram was taken and it showed widespread ST segment elevations. He was treated for anaphylactic shock as well as acute coronary syndrome and was able to be discharged within a few days."
