  "text": "A 7 month old male baby was presented with incessant cry, fever and swelling in left upper leg of 2 weeks duration. X-ray of leg showed a well demarcated lytic lesion in the meta diaphysial region of left tibia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an irregular lytic lesion with intramedullary extension. Incisional biopsy showed a vascular tumor, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma grade 1. Meanwhile the patient became asymptomatic and subsequent follow ups showed regression in the size of the tumor and complete disappearance after one and half years. This points towards the need of a wait and watch policy in such intermediate grade vascular tumours even though the lesion is so extensive. This is the first case report of an extensive self regressing epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of tibia in an infant to our knowledge."
