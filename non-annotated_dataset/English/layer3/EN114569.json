  "text": "A 27-month-old girl with a 1-week history of vomiting with mild intermittent strabismus underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging, showing diffuse brainstem and spinal leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was unremarkable. Antitubercular treatment was started without any improvement. A spinal intradural biopsy was suggestive for primary leptomeningeal melanomatosis. Chemotherapy was started, but general clinical conditions progressively worsened and patient died 11Â months after diagnosis. Molecular investigations were performed post-mortem on tumor tissue and revealed absence of BRAF(V600E), GNAQ(Q209) and GNA11(Q209) mutations but the presence of a NRAS(Q61K) mutation."
