  "text": "We describe a case of a 16-year-old male who presented with leg pain 2 years after a left distal third oblique tibia fracture. The fracture was initially treated non-operatively with excellent alignment. He did well for many months and returned to playing football with some vague persistent discomfort in his leg. Two years after the original injury, he was hit while playing football and started experiencing increasing left leg pain. The subsequent evaluation and findings are outlined here."
