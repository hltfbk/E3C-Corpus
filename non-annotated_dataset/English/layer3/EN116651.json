  "text": "A 49-year-old woman presented with diffuse abdominal colicky pain and vomitus over the previous seven days. An X-ray of the abdomen revealed obstruction of the small intestine. The patient underwent contrast enhanced abdominal computerized tomography (CT), which confirmed the obstruction at the jejunum and an associated circumferential wall thickening extending about 3 cm in length, causing concentric narrowing of the lumen. At laparotomy, a mass was recognized at the level of the jejunum in the small intestine, which caused almost complete obstruction of the lumen. At the point of obstruction, adhered loops of small intestine were found. A segmental small bowel resection was performed with 5 cm clear margins and its respective mesenteric lymph nodes."
