  "text": "A 34-year-old nullipara presented with acute pelvic pain at 17Â weeks of gestation with dichorionic-diamniotic twins, one in each horn of an anomalous uterus first diagnosed in pregnancy as bicornuate. Three-dimensional ultrasound and MRI revealed myometrial disruption in the left rudimentary uterine horn, and the patient underwent an uncomplicated abdominal hemi-hysterectomy. Fourteen days later, an uncomplicated dilation and curettage was performed for a fetal anomaly in the remaining twin in the right unicornuate uterus."
