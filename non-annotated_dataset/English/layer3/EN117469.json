  "text": "We present an unusual case of desmoplastic fibroma in a 56-year-old Caucasian man, who presented to our hospital with lumbar pain. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed, demonstrating two lytic expansile lesions affecting both his left iliac bone and his left sacral wing. Curettage and cortical-cancellous grafting was performed, followed by postoperative computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging."
