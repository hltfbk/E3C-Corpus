  "text": "A 23-year-old Chinese female patient presented with a cutaneous odontogenic sinus tract that was initially misdiagnosed as a sebaceous cyst. The patient had undergone surgical excision and traditional Chinese medical therapy before endodontic consultation. With the aid of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), it was confirmed that the causative factor of the cutaneous odontogenic sinus tract was chronic periapical periodontitis of the right mandibular second molar, which had a rare and curved distolingual root. The resolution of the sinus tract and apical healing was accomplished following nonsurgical root canal treatment."
