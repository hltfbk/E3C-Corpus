  "text": "We present a patient with significant IVH and minimal ICH who deteriorated rapidly to coma after presentation. Despite this exam, an initially non-functioning diversion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and temporary halt of further attempts of CSF diversion in the setting of an early \"do not resuscitate order,\" our patient gradually improved and, with supportive ICU care and rehabilitation, was able to communicate and ambulate with assistance at 12â€‰weeks."
