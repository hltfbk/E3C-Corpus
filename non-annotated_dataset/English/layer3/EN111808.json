  "text": "This case report describes the management of a professional soccer player that developed a traumatic fat fracture over the lateral thigh. The patient presented with persistent pain, reduced range of movement, and inability to participate in sporting activity. Symptoms were refractory to non-operative treatment. Following acute surgical excision of the fat fracture, the patient was able to make an early return to sporting activity with no complications at short-term follow-up."
