  "text": "A very rare case of teratoma of the bladder in a 17-year old Asian girl is presented. The patient had chief complaints of hematuria. The diagnosis was made on cystoscopy and confirmed histopathologically. Complete excision was possible. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first such case reported from Indonesia and the South East Asian region."
