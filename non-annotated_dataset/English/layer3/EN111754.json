  "text": "In this study, the co-mutations of TP53 and KRAS in a 64-year-old non-smoking man with squamous-cell NSCLC patient was described using the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The patient was treated with the pembrolizumab combined with gemcitabine as the salvage therapy, and a marked partial response could be attained, which had persisted for over 7 months."
