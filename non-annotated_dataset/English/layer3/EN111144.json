  "text": "We report the case of a 65-year-old male patient who, after initial inadequate surgery of a tumor of the left forearm, developed local recurrence that was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery and postoperative radiation therapy. Histologically the tumor showed an abrupt separation of two different patterns. One component consisted of interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with cigar-shaped nuclei strongly positive for smooth muscle actin, desmin and H-caldesmon. The other component consisted of a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma with osteoid and chondroid matrix production, which positive for SATB2. Thus, a final diagnosis of dedifferentiated leiomyosarcoma was rendered. Fifteen months after treatment, the patient presented further local and distant relapse with pulmonary metastases and died 23Â months after the first presentation."
