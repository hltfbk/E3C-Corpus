  "text": "A 44-year-old male patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) experienced a CMV-reactivation within the first 4 weeks of allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation. Administration of LMV was initiated at day + 34. Due to increasing viral loads, LMV treatment was discontinued after 8 days. The patient was then administered with valganciclovir (valGCV) until viral DNA was undetectable. Due to neutropenia, valGCV treatment was switched to LMV secondary prophylaxis. For 4 weeks, the patient maintain virologic suppression. Then, CMV viral loads increased with a fast kinetic. Genotypic testing of the viral polymerase UL54, the kinase UL97 as well as the viral terminase UL56 and UL89 revealed the mutation C325Y in UL56, which is associated with the high level LMV resistance."
