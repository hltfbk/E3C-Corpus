  "text": "A morbidly obese woman with a high body mass index (>36) at 24â€‰weeks gestational age presented with several gestational diabetes mellitus risk factors. Her glucose tolerance test verified gestational diabetes mellitus, and, incidentally, her C-reactive protein level was elevated without obvious reason. Her plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines had also been assessed and were exaggerated. After lifestyle intervention, including weight management, the patient's inflammatory mediators, including her C-reactive protein level, dropped. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the relationship between the patient's inflammation and obesity."
