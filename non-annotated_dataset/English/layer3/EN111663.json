  "text": "A 45-year-old woman presented to our hospital for evaluation of a cervical lesion. The gynecologist found a large polypoid mass, whose biopsy showed glandular components of probable germ cell origin based on the immunohistochemical features. The patient underwent total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The cervical polypoid mass was found to consist of both epithelial and mesenchymal tissues, including immature glandular structure resembling fetal enteric tubules, neuroepithelial cells, hyaline cartilage, and rhabdomyosarcoma cells. This tumor was diagnosed as TCS of the uterine cervix. Following the surgery, the patient received radiotherapy and has been free of disease for 13â€‰months."
