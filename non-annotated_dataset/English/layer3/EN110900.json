  "text": "Our patient is a 12-year-old girl with ulcerative colitis who presented with fevers and insidious onset of joint pain at multiple sites. She had multiple joint effusions on imaging and blood and joint cultures were negative. Biopsy of the left acromion demonstrated acute and chronic osteomyelitis with areas of necrosis and granulomatous inflammation suggestive of CNO. Patient was started on high dose corticosteroids as well as methotrexate injections with marked improvement in symptoms."
