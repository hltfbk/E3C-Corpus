  "text": "The case was a 28-year-old man with prior history of malignancy who was found to have a hepatic mass mimicking metastatic liver tumor. A new low density area of 20â€‰mm in diameter in liver segment 7 was found on follow-up CT. With suspicious diagnosis of metastatic liver cancer, laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was performed. A pathological examination revealed no evidence of malignancy, but showed necrotic granuloma with eosinophil infiltration and the presence of a larva with Y-shaped lateral cords, which are specific to anisakid larvae. The type of larva was identified as Pseudoterranova decipiens sensu lato using PCR of DNA purified from a fixed granuloma embedded in paraffin."
