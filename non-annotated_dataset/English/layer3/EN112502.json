  "text": "We describe here the first case of primary hepatic leiomyosarcoma successfully treated by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). The patient was a 68-year-old woman who presented with right upper quadrant pain and weight loss over the past 5 wk before admission. Abdominal computed tomography (commonly known as CT) and ultrasonography showed a mixed echoic mass measuring about 10 cm Ã— 7 cm occupying the right lobe of the liver. Exploratory laparotomy was performed 1 wk after admission. The tumor was unresectable and biopsy was performed. Based on rapid frozen-section and histopathological examination, a final diagnosis of primary hepatic leiomyosarcoma was established. TACE was performed 2 wk later. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 7 after the operation. Contrast-enhanced CT showed that the tumor significantly shrunk with satisfactory lipiodol deposition. The patient has been followed up for 82 mo until now, and no progressive enlargement of the tumor or distal metastasis was observed."
