  "text": "A 45-year-old female was treated with adalimumab 40 mg once every 2 weeks for pustulosis palmoplantaris and psoriatic arthritis. After 2 injections, the patient developed a psoriatiform eruption on her body, which improved after discontinuation of adalimumab but worsened after treatment with etanercept 50 mg twice weekly. Eventually, the patient was treated with topical corticosteroids and ustekinumab 45 mg once every 3 months with a complete remission of the psoriatiform eruption."
