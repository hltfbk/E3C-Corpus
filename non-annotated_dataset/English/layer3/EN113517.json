  "text": "A 4-year-old girl with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received maintenance chemotherapy in an outpatient clinic developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome. RSV infection was confirmed by a positive rapid antigen test and serological assay. Subsequently, she was diagnosed with severe myocarditis caused by RSV infection, which was diagnosed by abnormal findings of cardiac echography and ECG and elevated biomarkers for myocardial damage. Then, she was treated in the intensive care unit for 13Â days. High amounts of RSV type B RNA was detected in tracheal aspirates and serum sample."
