  "text": "Authors report a case of epitheloid hemangioma of the middle phalanx in a young girl without any cutaneous manifestations. The lesion presented as a swollen middle finger, and plain radiographs showed a geographic area of destruction with cortical thinning and intra lesional calcifications. The case was managed by curettage and bone grafting. Histology confirmed this as a case of epitheloid hemangioma."
