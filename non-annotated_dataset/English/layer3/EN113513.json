  "text": "We present the case of a 54-year-old Mexican woman previously treated for Graves' disease who developed post-iodine hypothyroidism and exophthalmos, myxedema, and osteoarthropathy that did not improve after high doses of steroids (intravenous and oral). Her exophthalmos, myxedema, and osteoarthropathy syndrome symptoms improved as early as 6 months after treatment with rituximab."
