  "text": "A 34-year-old female patient had curative treatment of initial rectal adenocarcinoma in 2012, and was found to have lung metastases by follow-up CT scan 3 years later. In 2018, she was found to have thyroid metastasis by imaging due to left neck pain and hoarseness. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) result suggested suspicious papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and bilateral cervical lymph nodes dissection. The histopathology of thyroidectomy specimen revealed a rectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the thyroid concomitant with the papillary carcinoma in metastatic adenocarcinoma. The patient received levothyroxine supplementation therapy and palliative chemotherapy with irinotecan and anti-angiogenesis for the metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. After 1 year of thyroidectomy, no newly developed lesion evidence of recurrent PTC was observed. The patient remains still alive."
