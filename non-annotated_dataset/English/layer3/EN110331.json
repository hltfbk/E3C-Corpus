  "text": "A 30-year-old female patient reported to the Department of Oral Surgery of the Consultation Center of Dental Treatment of Rabat, with a chief complaint of painful ulcers in the mouth since 2 years. These ulcers were recurrent and multiple causing difficulty in eating and speech. Alongside, history of ulcers on dorsal side of the tongue and lower lip was noted. Patient visited several doctors for the same problem but did not get efficient relief. The patient was earlier treated withanalgesic. But lesions did not show any notable remission.\nExtra-oral examination didn't showanything in particular. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) revealed no abnormality.\nThe intraoral examinationrevealed ulcers on internal side of the lower lip and on the dorsal side of the tongue, and the ulcers were discrete and uniquelocated on the lower lip region and the dorsal lingual mucosa. The ulcers were ovoid in shape and shallow, with size varying from 2mm to 3mm with sloping margins. Ulcers were surrounded by erythematous halo. Floor of the ulcer was covered with pseudomembranous slough. On palpation, all inspectory findings were confirmed. The ulcers were tender with no induration at borders and margins. Based on the history and clinical presentation of the lesions,diagnosis of recurrent aphtous ulcers was given.\nThe patient was treated by 915nm diode laser. A 300s/cm 2 fibre was used with power settings of 2 W, cw and in non-contact mode. The tip was moved with circular movements of 1mm/s in speed from the periphery towards the centre of the lesion. The tip was also moved gradually closer to the lesion from 10mm to 1mm distance. The irradiation time of each lesion was 30s/cm 2. Consecutive to each irradiation, the patient was asked if she was still feeling pain. Most lesions were irradiated twice. At the end of the treatment, the patient reported that ulcers were free of pain and mildly sensitive to the touch. The patient was sent home and instructions were given to avoid hard, acidic and salty food. The patient was followed-up over a period of 5 days after laser therapy and showed a complete remission of the lesions, with no signs of pain and discomfort."
