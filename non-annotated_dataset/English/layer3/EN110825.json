  "text": "We report the case of a 42-year-old Sri LankanÂ man investigated for fatigue during a brief upper respiratory tract infection and found to have high liver transaminases and high serum ferritin, which persisted even after complete resolution of the infection. Homozygosity for H63D mutation in the HFE gene was detected. Liver enzymes, serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation normalized following venesections."
