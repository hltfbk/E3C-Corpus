  "text": "A 38-year-old man rapidly developed fulminant GBS. In blood examination, he was positive for a broad range of anti-ganglioside antibodies, including anti-GQ1b, GT1a, GT1b, GD1a, GD1b and GD3 IgG antibodies. We performed immunosuppressive therapies using intravenous immunoglobulin and intravenous methylprednisolone. Although disturbance of consciousness and weakness of the distal upper and lower limbs improved gradually, weakness of the oropharynx, neck, and proximal upper limbs were resistant to these therapies. Anti-GT1a IgG antibodies remained persistently positive. Consequently, mechanical ventilation and tube feeding were required for 7 and 10â€‰months, respectively. Two years later, weakness of the proximal upper limbs and mild respiratory dysfunction remained as sequelae."
