  "text": "An 8-month-old Han Chinese girl presented with the classic nMFS phenotype, including prominent manifestations of bone overgrowth, aortic root dilatation, and multiple cardiac valve dysfunctions. Genetic analysis revealed that she was heterozygous for a de novo FBN1 missense mutation (c.3331 T > C). The mutation leads to the substitution of a highly conserved FBN1 cysteine residue (p.Cys1111Arg), which is likely to severely perturb the FBN1 structure because of an alteration of the disulfide bond pattern in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) 12 domain. This variant was absent in 208 ethnically matched controls, providing further evidence that it may be causative of nMFS. An analysis of nMFS-associated mutations from the UMD-FBN1 database indicates that those de novo mutations altering disulfide bonds or Ca(2+) binding sites of the cbEGF domains encoded by exons 25-33, and a lack of phenotypic heterogeneity may be associated with an increased risk for nMFS."
