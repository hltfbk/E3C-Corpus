  "text": "A 39-year-old man presented with tearing and pain in the right eye. A biopsy of the tumor invading the sinonasal cavities, right orbit and cranial base confirmed the diagnosis of LA-SNUC. Induction TPF chemotherapy induced remarkable tumor shrinkage and rapidly improved the symptoms. He subsequently received CCRT and achieved complete remission of the disease. The other case is a 21-year-old man who presented with worsening vision. The unresectable tumor involving the nasal septum and cranial base was pathologically diagnosed as SNUC. TPF chemotherapy followed by CCRT yielded complete remission of the disease with preserved visual function. Both patients have been disease-free for 44 mo."
