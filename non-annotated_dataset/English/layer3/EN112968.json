  "text": "We present the case of a 73-year-old female patient who had been treated for invasive ductal breast cancer 7 years ago and was diagnosed with a solid hepatic lesion at segments VI and VII and a small, calcified lesion at the tail of the pancreas on follow-up with an abdominal computed tomography. Oncology council decided that both lesions could be resected after determining whether they were metastatic or second primary malignancies. The patient underwent laparotomy and rapid biopsy which showed primary hepatocellular carcinoma and fibrosis of the pancreas. We performed hepatic segmentectomy (VI-VII) and cholecystectomy, while the pancreatic lesion was left intact. The postoperative course of the patient was uncomplicated and she remains disease free 2 years after the operation without any adjuvant therapy."
