  "text": "The patient was a 71-year-old man taking immunosuppressants who had previously undergone right living kidney transplantation for chronic nephritis. He presented to hospital complaining of abdominal pain and was diagnosed as having rectal cancer with obstructive colitis. Although conservative therapy by fasting was continued for 5 weeks, his obstructive colitis did not improve. Therefore, we decided to perform a two-stage operation. First, we performed a laparoscopic Hartmann's operation. It took 6 months for his obstructive colitis to improve after this operation, and then we performed a laparoscopic colorectal anastomosis. There were no postoperative complications in either operation."
