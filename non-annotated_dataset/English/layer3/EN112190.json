  "text": "A case of C.X. Z, male aged 39â€‰years old, who presented to our department with sudden onset of symptoms of subacute right heart failure due localized CP. In January, 2018 C.X.Z presented to the county hospital with complaints of 10-day history of transient mild bilateral pedal edema. He was managed on diuretic therapy and symptoms resolved completely. 10 months later, he suddenly presented to the local facility with symptoms of subacute right heart failure. 7 days after on-set of symptoms, his condition shifted from NYHA I to III-IV. Although wake-up chest radiography appeared normal, standard medical therapy yielded no positives results. He was referred to our hospital, upon which after echocardiography and computed tomography investigations, aforementioned diagnosis was made. We performed off-pump partial pericardiectomy with no complications. After operation, he received analgesics and diuretics for pain and edema(ascites) respectively. He was discharged 7-days after operation on analgesics only, with no symptoms of right heart failure."
