  "text": "We report a case of myoepithelial carcinoma combined with myoepithelioma occurring in the soft tissue of the right forearm of an 84-year-old Arabian man. We describe the clinical, radiological and pathological features dominated by histological polymorphism. We will also describe the proposed histological criteria of malignancy and the major role of immunohistochemistry in positive and differential diagnosis. We finally mention the therapeutic arsenal available."
