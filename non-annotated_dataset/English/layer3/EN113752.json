  "text": "A 4.5-month-old caucasian female infant with congenital giant hemangioma in the posterior region of her neck presented to our Institute for Childhood Diseases where she underwent clinical, laboratory, and radiological investigations. A low blood platelet count indicated the use of corticosteroids and blood components as first-line therapy. The lack of therapeutic response induced the introduction of orally administered propranolol as additive therapy. A 3-week treatment led to a reduction in the size of hemangioma and a rise in platelet count which enabled surgical treatment and definite healing."
