  "text": "We present the case of a 27-year-old G3P22002 female presenting at 19 weeks and 1 day of gestation by last menstrual period for scheduled prenatal visit. Ultrasound revealed a single fetus without heart tones and adequate amniotic fluid. Limited fetal measurements were consistent with estimated gestational age of 17 weeks. Labor was induced with misoprostol due to fetal demise. Autopsy revealed an immature female fetus with grade 1-2 maceration. The ears were low-set and posteriorly rotated. The fingers were short bilaterally, and the right foot showed absence of the second and third digits. Evaluation of the organs showed predominantly marked autolysis consistent with retained stillbirth. Placental examination revealed multiple findings, including focal pseudovillous papilliform trophoblastic proliferation of the undersurface of the chorionic plate and clustering of perpendicularly oriented sclerotic chorionic villi in the chorion laeve, which have not been previously reported in cases of chromosomal abnormalities. Karyotype of placental tissue revealed a 48,XXX,+18 karyotype and the same double trisomy of fetal thymic tissue by FISH."
