  "text": "A 40-year-old woman complained of back and abdominal pain. Upon admission, her blood pressure was 85/41 mmHg and heart rate was 129 beats/min. Computed tomography (CT) showed large intraperitoneal bleeding due to PAA rupture. After CT scanning, her systolic blood pressure decreased to 50 mmHg. Therefore, we performed emergency TAE with partial IABO. She was treated by TAE of the anterior superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, anterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery, and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. However, even after TAE, minor extravasation around the superior mesenteric artery continued, and her vital signs remained unstable. Stent-graft placement was selected to stop the haemorrhage, preserving normal blood flow of the superior mesenteric artery trunk. Excellent patency of the stent graft was confirmed on follow-up CT, and she was discharged on postoperative day 56."
