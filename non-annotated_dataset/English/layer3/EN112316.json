  "text": "We report a case of HUS following E.coli prostatitis and bacteraemia in an adult male. He presented with severe renal and neurological involvement. Initially considered as a \"typical\" HUS, the condition was treated by antibiotics. No other specific treatment for HUS was administered. The outcome was favorable. We eventually identified a non shiga toxin producing E.coli. Genetic testing of the complement alternative pathway revealed a rare - potentially pathogenic - variant of factor H. This constitutes a possible factor of susceptibility for atypical HUS, suggesting that E.coli infection may be the trigger."
