  "text": "A 38-year-old man with past history of hypertension was admitted for an elective lumbosacral spine surgery. He had been taking Valsartan 160 mg a day for the past 4 years.At the end of the surgical procedure and turning the patient into supine position, we noticed severe swelling in the neck and the face with.an edematous tongue, floor of the mouth, glottis, and supraglottic areas. A diagnosis of drug induced angioedema was made and intravenous dexamethasone, diphenhydramine and ranitidine were given. The patient remained intubated and was transferred to the intensive care unit. The valsartan was suspected to be the precipitating factor for the angioedema and was therefore discontinued.The swelling started to regress after 2 h, and resolved completely by the third day."
