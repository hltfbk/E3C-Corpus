  "text": "Here, we reported an 8-month-old female patient with compound heterozygosity in the UNC13D gene. The patient, who presented typical symptoms, was diagnosed with HLH based on HLH-2004 guidelines. High-throughput amplicon sequencing for the full-length exon, including a 5 bp padding region and 6 HLH-related genes, was performed to identify the pathogenic mutations in this patient. In all, 9 heterozygous variations were detected, namely, 7 nonpathogenic SNPs, one nonsense mutation (NM_199242.2:c.2206C > T, p.Gln736X), and one splicing mutation (NM_199242.2:c.2709 + 1G > A). These two mutations were considered pathogenic according to previous studies and functional prediction. A two-generation pedigree analysis based on Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the result."
