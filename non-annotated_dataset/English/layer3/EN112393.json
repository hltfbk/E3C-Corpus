  "text": "We report the case of a 32-year-old man who presented to our hospital because of abdominal pain that had worsened over 5 d. He had no significant past history except that he had eaten fish 1 wk previously. Upper endoscopy revealed an irregular submucosal tumor on the front wall of the gastric antrum. Endoscopic ultrasonography and computed tomography showed a fish bone penetrating the gastric antrum and migratingin to the neck of the pancreas. The patient underwent laparoscopic surgery and had no complications one week after the operation."
