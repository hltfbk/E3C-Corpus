  "text": "In this case presentation, we first described the approach of implantation of the cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P) via one bipolar pacing lead in middle cardiac vein (MCV) and one quadripolar pacing lead in anterior interventricular vein (AIV) in a patient developing complete AVB, who had been previously diagnosed with rheumatic valvular heart disease with triple valve replaced. After the CRT-P implantation, the two pacing leads in coronary sinus (CS) provided a dual-site ventricular pacing from the anterior septum and posterior septum, which resulted in a narrow QRS complex and an increased ventricular synchrony. During the long-term follow-up, no deterioration of heart function was documented and pacing parameters remained good."
