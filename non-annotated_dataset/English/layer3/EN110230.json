  "text": "A 70-year-old left-handed woman, without any significant pathological history presented with numbness and tingling sensation in the left hand affecting thumb, index and middle finger, with a decreased grip strength, appeared 6 months ago. Interrogation revealed a progressive evolution ofnocturnal acroparesthesia over several months. Physical examination did not reveal any soft tissue mass on palpation, with a normal range of motion of the wrist (extension 70 °, flexion 75 °).There was a decrease in sensitivity in the territory of the median nerve as compared with the contralateral hand without evidence of motricity impairment. The Tinel's sign was positive at the wrist. Electophysiological study confirmed the diagnosis of CTS. Standard X-rays did not found any abnormalities. Surgery was performed under locoregional anesthesia with axillary block and with tourniquet controlled hemostasis maintained during the procedure. The patient was arranged in a dorsal decubitus position. A palmar conventional approach of the carpal tunnel was chosen. Transverse carpal ligament was incised. Intra-operatively, a lipomatous mass occupying the carpal tunnel space was discovered. The median nerve was carefully identified, It was flattened, suffering and compressed by the mass. The tumor was carefully removed measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm and neurolysis of the median nerve was performed. Histopathological study of the resected mass was consistent with a lipoma with no evidence of malignancy. No immobilization was associated. At the clinical review of two months postoperatively, the patient recovered full hand function (complete mobility of the fingers and normal grip strength) with entire disappearance of acroparesthesia."
