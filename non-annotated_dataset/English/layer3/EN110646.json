  "text": "A 48-year-old man presented with headache lasting for 10 d. CT of the brain showed a round, heterogeneous, high-density lesion with surrounding edema in the right temporal lobe. For further diagnosis, a series of MRI examinations of the brain were subsequently performed, and a hemorrhagic lesion with ring-like enhancement was determined. The whole lesion was relatively hypoperfused on arterial spin labeling images. Surgical resection of the lesion and histopathological examination confirmed that the lesion was a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with massive hemorrhage."
