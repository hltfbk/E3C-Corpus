  "text": "A 56-year-old Caucasian man with severe aortic insufficiency presented to the emergency department for evaluation of substernal chest pain. An inferior myocardial infarction was diagnosed by the electrocardiogram and serologic markers. Cardiac catheterization revealed complete occlusion of the right coronary artery as well as a 50-75% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. Angioplasty of the right coronary artery was performed, but immediate re-occlusion occurred. Subsequently, hypotension and severe hypoxemia developed and persisted despite intubation and mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen. A significant right-to-left shunt through a patent foramen ovale was diagnosed by contrast transesophageal echocardiogram. Surgical intervention was required and included coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement as well as closure of his atrial septal defect."
