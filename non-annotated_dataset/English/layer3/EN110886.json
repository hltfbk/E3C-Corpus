  "text": "A 76-year-old lady presented to the outpatient clinic with the chief complaint of right flank pain and swelling. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was revealed a large herniated sac (60*30 mm) in the upper lumbar triangle with protrusion of retroperitoneal and omental fat, right renal pelvis, ureteropelvic junction and proximal ureter with consecutive hydronephrosis. Herniated retroperitoneal and omental fat was reduced, and closure of the abdominal wall defect was done using retro-muscular Mesh and was fixed to the fascia. The patient was discharged 24 h after the surgery without any complications."
