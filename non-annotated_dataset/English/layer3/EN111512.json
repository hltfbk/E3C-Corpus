  "text": "We describe a 40-year-old woman with ESRD secondary to IgA-nephritis and severe bilateral manifestation of tumoral calcinosis associated with hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. The patient was on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and treatment with vitamin D analogues. After switching her to a daily hemodialysis schedule and adjusting the medical treatment, the patient experienced a significant dissolution of her soft tissue calcifications within a couple of weeks. Complete remission was achieved 11 mo after the initial diagnosis."
