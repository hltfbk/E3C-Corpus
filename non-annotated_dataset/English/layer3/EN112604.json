  "text": "A 34-year-old male patient with disseminated varicella and pneumonitis was admitted to our hospital. The diagnosis of varicella was established serologically by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and by polymerase chain reaction confirmation of the virus in vesicular fluid. The patient has been receiving adalimumab and methotrexate for the last 3 years due to ankylosing spondylitis and was seropositive to varicella zoster virus prior to the introduction of TNF-α antagonists. Acyclovir was administered for 10 days with the resolution of clinical illness and radiological signs of pneumonitis."
