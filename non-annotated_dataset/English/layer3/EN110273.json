  "text": "A 24 year old G2 P1 011 was referred to the Bamenda Regional Hospital from a district hospital for the management of exteriorisation of bowel through the vagina.\nShe was seen earlier that day for per vagina bleeding accompanied with mild lower abdominal pain, without any relevant past history. After clinical assessment she was diagnosed of incomplete abortion in an eleven week pregnancy, and indicated for uterine evacuation by manual vacuum aspiration.\nUpon aspiration, the student doctor noticed that bowel was coming from the uterus. He immediately stopped and referred her to the Regional hospital for management.\nUpon arrival at the Regional Hospital, she had a good general condition and normal vital parameters, her abdomen was also soft. On inspection of the vulva, small bowel was exteriorised which was worsen by increased intraabdominal pressure.\nOur working diagnosis was uterine perforation with small bowel exteriorisation.\nThe patient was cross-matched 2 pints of whole blood and taken immediately to the theatre for an emergency laparotomy. We found a 2cm uterine perforation at the fundus with small bowel prolapse. She benefitted from a resection of 190 cm of small bowel with termino-terminal anastomosis. Uterine debris was aspirated per abdominally followed by closure of the uterine rent. The abdomen was washed with warm saline and intraabdominal drained placed at the Douglas pouch and left para-colic gutter.\nThe post operatory was complicated by wound infection which was managed accordingly and by patient discharged on post operatory day 17."
