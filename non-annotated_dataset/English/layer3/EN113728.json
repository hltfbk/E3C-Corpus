  "text": "We report a case of a 46-year-old Arabic man who presented with erectile dysfunction and painful induration of the penile root. Eight months ago, he had undergone abdomino-perineal resection for rectal adenocarcinoma after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. The histological evaluation of the resected specimen disclosed a ypT3N0 tumor with a poor therapeutic response (around 5%). An adjuvant chemotherapy by XELOX (oxaliplatin plus capecitabine) regimen has been prescribed for the patient. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed tumoral infiltration of penile structures and a biopsy of the corpora cavernosa was performed. The histological examination disclosed a penile metastasis from the patient's previous rectal adenocarcinoma. The patient is still alive and continues his adjuvant therapy."
