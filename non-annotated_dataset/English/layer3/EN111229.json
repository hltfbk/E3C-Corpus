  "text": "A 67-year-old woman presented with severe paroxysmal cramp-like pain on the right side, including the head and both upper and lower extremities. The pain started 5 years earlier, was initially mild and occasional, but gradually intensified to an unbearable degree with an average of 10-15 daily episodes, each lasting for 5-10Â mins. The patient disclosed \"hemorrhagic stroke\" 10 years ago that resulted in hemiplegia on the right side. CT examination verified the lesion. The patient received daily injection of 2-mL 2% lidocaine under ultrasound guidance to block the stellate ganglion. Pain subsided rapidly in both intensity and frequency. On the seventh day, the patient no longer had pain episodes. At the last follow-up, 9 months later, the patient was free from pain."
