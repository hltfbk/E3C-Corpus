  "text": "A 56 year old Caucasian male presented with years of steroid treated joint pain and recent onset diarrhea, weight loss and abdominal pain. Ultimately he was found to have a platelet count of 4000 with concomitant endocarditis and embolic stroke. Small bowel biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of WD approximately 1 year after his first visit. His platelets improved with antibiotic treatment but he eventually expired 16 months after his initial consult and 5 months after his definitive diagnosis."
