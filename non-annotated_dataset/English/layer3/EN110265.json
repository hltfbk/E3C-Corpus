  "text": "An otherwise healthy, 30 year old woman presented to the department of Maxillo-facial surgery complaining of right pre-auricular pain associated with trismus of one month's duration. She had been treated with amoxicilline orally further 10 days with no improvement. The clinical examination revealed mild pre-auricular swelling on the right side and reduced, painful mouth opening (10 mm). No adjacent infections (ENT or dental) have been found. The patient presented low-grade pyrexia of 37.4 Â° C and her vital signs were normal. Hematological values were as follows: hematocrit: 36.6%; hemoglobin: 12.10 g/100 ml; red blood cell count: 419-104/mm3; white blood cell count: 8360/mm 3 with 85% polymorpho-nuclear cells. Orthopantomography has showed pinching space of the right TMJ. A computed tomography (CT) scan has objectified osteolysis of the right mandibular condyle and showed a diffuse soft-tissue swelling involving the pre-auricular region with two abscesses in the right infra-temporal fossa. The patient was operated under general anesthesia. A pre-auricular incision with a temporal extension was used. A resection of the lytic condyle, drainage of abcesses and extensive washing of the joint cavity were performed. Culture of the purulent fluid was negative. The histopathologic examination concluded to non-specific chronic active osteomyelitis. After the surgery drainage, she improved immediately and regained full movement of the mandible 5 days later. Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid were continued intravenously for one week, followed by a further 3 weeks given orally. CT scan at 3 months objectified rearrangements without signs of reactivation. One year later, the patient presented the same clinical symptoms on the other side (left) with pre-auricular swelling and painful trismus. Osteoarthritis of the left TMJ was easily diagnosed. CT scan showed a necrosis of left mandibular condyle and abscesses in infra-temporal fossa with no reactivation of the other side. Condylar resection and lavage of condylar cavity were done by a pre-auricular incision. Intravenous antibiotic treatment was started with Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid 1g 3 times a day and changed to oral form during 3 weeks. At 1 month follow-up the facial swelling and tenderness had disappeared and mandibular range of motion improved to 40 mm. The subsequent follow-up examinations showed no further complaints with a decline of 36 months."
