  "text": "A case of simultaneous triquetrum, lunate, and capitate intraosseous ganglion cysts is presented. A 56-year-old right-handed woman presented with a 6-month history of persistent left-wrist pain. An old minor trauma was reported; however, the plain radiographs did not show any fractures. Subsequently, magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and it showed small cysticstructures in the lunate, triquetrum, and capitate which is keeping with small intraosseous ganglia. The patient did not want to go down the surgical route as the pain was to some extent manageable."
