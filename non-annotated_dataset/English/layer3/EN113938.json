  "text": "An 86-year-old female presented with chronic daily headache of 1 year duration. Her headaches were exclusively nocturnal and woke her up daily around midnight. Clinical examination was unremarkable. All basic investigations were normal. Subsequent gadolinium enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain did not show any significant pathology. There was no satisfactory response to paracetamol, diclofenac sodium, mefenamic acid, tramadol, flunarizine and sodium valproate. Indomethacin was started with the provisional diagnosis of hypnic headache. There was absolute response by day 3 of indomethacin. She remains headache free on low dose indomethacin maintenance at 1 year after the diagnosis."
