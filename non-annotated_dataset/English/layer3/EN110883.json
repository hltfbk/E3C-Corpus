  "text": "A 16-year-old black African girl was admitted for altered consciousness and a left breast tumor. She was admitted in a state of apparent death. Her death was confirmed on clinical examination. A postmortem biopsy of the mammary tumor showed standard histology of a proliferation of fusiform or rounded tumor cells in places, which were not very cohesive with marked anisokaryosis and numerous foci of tumor necrosis. Immunohistochemistry showed a positivity of CD31 and factor VIII markers with a proliferation index (Ki-67) estimated at 30%."
