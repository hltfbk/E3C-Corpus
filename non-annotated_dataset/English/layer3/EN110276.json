  "text": "A 29 year old para 1 presenting with a history of postcoital bleeding for three months. She was not using contraceptives and was trying for a pregnancy. On per speculum examination, a suspicious growth on the posterior lip of the cervix was noted for which a punch biopsy was done.\nThe histo-pathological examination showed moderately differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma with a villoglandular pattern. There was no evidence of lymphovascular space invasion.\nAn MRI showed a 3.2 × 2.5 × 3.6 cm tumour arising from the anterior lip of the cervix, with distal parametrial involvement but no significant pelvic or retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement.\nThe multi-disciplinary team meeting confirmed a stage IIB distal cancer of the cervix and decided to treat with chemo-radiotherapy. She received 45 Gy in 25 fractions of external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis with concomitant weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m2.\nThe radiotherapy dose to the primary cervical tumour was 26 Gy to point A. The primary cervical tumour had responded well to the initial chemo radiotherapy. After 4 weeks the cervical lesion has completely responded."
