  "text": "In this report we present the unusual case of a 70-year-old woman with acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction, which was complicated by a combined rupture of the interventricular septum near the apex, and the free wall of the left ventricle with concomitant formation of a pseudoaneurysm. The double myocardial rupture was accidentally discovered 10 days later with echocardiography, when the patient, complaining only of mild exertional dyspnea, was hospitalized for a scheduled coronary angiography. The patient underwent successful surgical correction of the double myocardial rupture along with by-pass grafting."
