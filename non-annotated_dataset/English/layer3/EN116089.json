  "text": "A 21-year-old African-American female presented with a subcutaneous mass on her flank. Grossly, the mass was red-tan, oval, and well-demarcated, measuring approximately 0.5Â cm in diameter. Microscopically, the mass was composed of spindle cells arranged in a swirling and intersecting pattern inside the lumens of two blood vessels. It extended through the vascular walls into the surrounding fibroadipose tissue; in some sections, the spindle cells were intermixed with the perivascular fibrous tissue. Elastin stain revealed remnants of elastic lamina partially surrounding the lesion. The nuclei of the spindle cells were relatively uniform with tapered ends and prominent nucleoli. No significant mitotic activity was observed. Multinucleated giant cells were scattered among the spindle cells, along with infiltrating lymphocytes and extravasated red blood cells. Immunohistochemical stains showed the spindle cells were positive for smooth muscle actin, focally positive for muscle specific actin, and negative for S-100, confirming their myofibroblastic differentiation. The overall morphological and immunohistochemical features are consistent with intravascular fasciitis."
