  "text": "A 3-year-old boy presented to our hospital with persistent cough and recurrent hospitalizations to the general ward and intensive care unit. The boy was diagnosed with focal lung bronchiectasis in the left lower lobe, which occurred after the patient aspirated an Orbeez bead before a year. The bead was removed using flexible bronchoscopy and a retrieval basket."
