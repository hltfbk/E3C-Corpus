  "text": "We report the case of a 15-year-old African-American boy with a history of mild chest trauma who underwent echocardiographic evaluation as part of an out-patient work up. The echocardiogram was suspicious for the presence of mitral-aortic intervalvular fibrosa pseudoaneurysm and cardiovascular magnetic resonance was then performed to better characterize this finding. In addition to confirming the presence of the aneurysm, cardiovascular magnetic resonance also revealed coarctation of the aorta, a bicuspid aortic valve, and anomalous pulmonary venous return."
