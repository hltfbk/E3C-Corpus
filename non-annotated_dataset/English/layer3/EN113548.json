  "text": "The patient requested dental rehabilitation in our clinic for prosthetic dentistry two and a half years ago. We examined him and made therapy plan, for complete removable maxillary denture and partial mandibular denture. Besides our instructions for proper use of dentures and necessity for regular controls, his next visit was after two and a half years. He came with enlarged tuberosity and papillary hyperplasia in the pre-maxillary region. After oral surgery treatment (laser removing of hyperplastic tissue) and a healing period of four weeks, we made indirect relining on the upper denture, re-occlusion and re-articulation achieving weak contacts between the lower natural teeth and upper teeth of the complete denture. The patient was advised not to bite food with his anterior teeth, and avoid chewing very hard food which tends to imprint and displace dentures."
