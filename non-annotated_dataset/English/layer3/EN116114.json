  "text": "A 79-year-old Japanese man was admitted to his local hospital with proteinuria, hypergammaglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and kidney dysfunction. Laboratory tests revealed monoclonal IgG(Î») M proteins in the serum and Bence-Jones proteins in the urine. Bone marrow aspiration showed monoclonal plasma cell proliferation, indicating a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Renal biopsy was performed to determine the cause of the proteinuria and kidney dysfunction. Histological examination of the biopsy specimen showed glomeruli with an irregularly thickened GBM and bubble-like structures in the capillary walls. Immunofluorescence staining did not show glomerular deposition of immunoglobulins, light chains, or complement components. Congo red staining did not show amyloid deposition. Electron microscopy showed an irregularly thickened GBM with unusual structures in the glomerular capillary walls including podocytic infolding and microspheres, suggesting PIG. There were no electron-dense deposits in the GBM, while various findings indicating podocyte injury were detected."
