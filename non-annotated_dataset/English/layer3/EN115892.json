  "text": "We report the case of a 34-year-old African woman who presented with a colouterine fistula secondary to polymyomectomy, which was diagnosed in the setting of severe endometritis. She had a Hartmann procedure and abundant irrigation of her abdominal and uterine cavities followed by placement of a double drainage in order to preserve fertility. This is the first case of a conservative management of the uterus in such conditions."
