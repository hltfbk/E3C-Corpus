  "text": "We describe the clinical features of a 7-year-old Italian white boy affected by Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome in comorbidity with autism spectrum disorder and the case of his 45-year-old white father, carrying the same point deletion (c.3677del) in the GLI3 gene and showing subclinical autistic symptoms. We performed a neuropsychiatric assessment of cognitive, adaptive, socio-communicative, and behavioral skills of the child. Concurrently, the father underwent his first psychiatric evaluation of cognitive skills and autistic symptoms."
