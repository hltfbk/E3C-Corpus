  "text": "An 81-year-old woman was admitted to Habib Thameur Hospital because of progressive dyspnea and atypical chest pain. No past medical history of cardiovascular risk factors. Clinical examination found no signs of congestion. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal heart sounds and a systolic murmurin pulmonary valve area. Trans thoracic echocardiogram exam demonstrated a right ventricular mass that measures 43 cm of diameter probing into the pulmonary artery with an intermittent pulmonary artery obstruction. Right chambers were dilated with important pulmonary arterial hypertension. CT scan reveals the right ventricular tumor and multiple left renal tumors with an extension to the left suprarenal glands and the the pelvicaly ceal system. No inferiorvena cava involvement was detected. Cardiac tumor resection surgery was indicated. The tumor was resected and addressed for pathology exam that revealed Clear cell tubule papillary renal cell carcinoma. The post operative course was uneventful and the patient was transferred to the urology department few days later. This patient was viewed five months later and she was totally asymptomatic."
