  "text": "A 59-year-old Japanese man underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for clinical T2bN0M0 prostate cancer, and the pathological diagnosis was pT3aN0 Gleason 3+4 adenocarcinoma with a negative surgical margin. Salvage radiation therapy was performed since his serum prostate-specific antigen remained at a measurable value. After the radiation, he underwent castration, followed by combined androgen blockade with estramustine phosphate and dexamethasone as each treatment was effective for only a few months to a year. Nine years after the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, computed tomography revealed a peritoneal tumor, although no other organ metastasis had been identified until then. He died six months after the appearance of peritoneal metastasis. An autopsy demonstrated peritoneal dissemination of the prostate cancer without any other metastasis."
