  "text": "A 30-year-old woman at 12 weeks of gestation was diagnosed with a large pancreatic tumor having a cystic pattern based on imaging. Although the preoperative diagnosis was uncertain, patient preference and clinical symptoms and signs suggested surgery. Open distal pancreatic resection including splenectomy was performed, and complete resection of the large cystic tumor was successfully achieved, with no postoperative complications. Although a solid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm (SPEN) was suspected, specimen morphology, including immunohistochemistry, supported the diagnosis of an adult benign pancreatic hemangioma."
