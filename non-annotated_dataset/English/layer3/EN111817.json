  "text": "A 39-year-old lady presented with recurrent soft tissue myxomas in thigh. A thorough evaluation with radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a clinical suspicion of this rare entity helped in making the diagnosis of Mazabraud's syndrome. The patient was treated with wide excision of the recurrent thigh swelling and watchful observation of two other asymptomatic swelling detected on MRI examination. Bisphosphonate therapy was given for fibrous dysplasia. At latest follow-up after 2 years, the patient was asymptomatic with no recurrence."
