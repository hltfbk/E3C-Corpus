  "text": "We report a case of a premature African newborn male baby born to nonconsanguineous parents who presented to our institution with agenesis of the septum pellucidum, unilateral optic nerve hypoplasia, and pituitary stalk hypoplasia. However, he had intact central endocrine function. He also presented with limb defects due to constricting amniotic band syndrome. Other dysmorphic features were low-set ears, microcephaly, and bilateral talipes equinovarus. He otherwise had a normal neurological examination result. Over time, he had an adequate weight gain and was managed by a multidisciplinary team."
