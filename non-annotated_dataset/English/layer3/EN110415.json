  "text": "We report the case of 27 year-old man who suffered left cranio-facial trauma, caused by motorcycle accident. Consequently the patient presented mandibular fracture which was fixed. four months after the accident, the patient consult for left red eye, sensation of progressive proptosis and the hearing of buzzing sound with progressive intensity, without pain nor visual impairment. The ophthalmologic examination was notable in the left eye for axil, reducible exophthalmos with thrill on palpation, and dilated episcleral vessels (corkscrew-like aspect). Anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Intra ocular pressure was normal. Fundoscopic examination found venous engorgement and tortuosity with normal optic disc aspect. Ophthalmologic examination in the right eye was normal. After such clinical findings, the diagnosis of CCF was the most probable. We completed with head arteriography. As expected this test revealed the presence of left CCF with shunt onthe C3-C4 segment of the internal carotid artery (ICA).The venous drainage was via posterior into the inferior petrosal sinus, lateral into the sphenoparietal sinus and the superior sagittal sinus, inside into the contralateral cavernous sinus and anterior the thrombosed superior ophthalmic vein was slightly opacified.\nEndovascular approach was indicated. Our patient undergone fistula embolization with coils after arterial catheterization. After 20 days we have noticed regression of exophthalmos, conjunctival vessels vasodilatation as well as retinal venous engorgement and tortuosity."
