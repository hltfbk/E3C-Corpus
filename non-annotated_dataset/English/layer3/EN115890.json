  "text": "A 46-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our institution in November 2009 with metastases of pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma from the L3 and L4 vertebrae. A course of radiotherapy at a dosage of 3,000 cGy delivered in individual doses of 200 cGy/day for 5 days/wk to the L3 and L4 vertebrae led to the disappearance of the patient's lumbar pain without any detectable side effects. Percussion of the patient's vertebral spine was negative, and no radiological progression of bone disease was found at her 1-year follow-up examination."
