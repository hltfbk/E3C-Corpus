  "text": "A 52-year-old female patient presented with gradually progressive numbness and weakness in her extremities for 6 months. X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed obvious anterior atlantoaxial dislocation (ADD), which was reducible on extensive view. Atlantoaxial pedicle screw fixation and bone graft was performed. Immediately after the operation, the neurological symptom significantly improved. The patient complained of restricted cervical rotation and suboccipital neuralgia which was exacerbated by rotation with an intensity of 7 on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10 at postoperative day 5. While a satisfactory reduction was detected in the postoperative CT, violation of the left atlantooccipital joint was observed in the left C1 screw. Nimesulide (daily dosage of 0.2 g) and bracing were recommended immediately. At the 2 month follow-up, both the neurological improvement and reduction were maintained. The VAS of suboccipital neuralgia is 3 and decreased to 1 at 6 months postoperative. Bony fusion of the left atlantooccipital joint was confirmed by CT scan at 6 months postoperative. The patient complained that the suboccipital neuralgia was tolerable without the assistance of braces or medications for pain. At the 18 month follow-up, only stiffness of head flexion and rotation was observed without suboccipital neuralgia."
