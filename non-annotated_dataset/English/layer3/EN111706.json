  "text": "A 40-year-old female underwent covered stent insertion to exclude the left RAA for suspected Takayasu arteritis in a reginal hospital. Three months later the RAA recurred with sign of threatened rupture, and the patient was transferred for salvage embolization with coils and thrombin injection. However, 20â€‰days after the embolization procedure, multiple painful subcutaneous nodules developed in her flanks. Undifferentiated sarcoma was revealed by the pathological biopsy of the nodules. The RAA in this case was most likely related with the malignancy."
