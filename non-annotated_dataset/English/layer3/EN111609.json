  "text": "A 62-year-old female presented with a non-healing subungual growth in the nail bed of the right middle finger for 2 years. The lesion was first medicated with iodine by the patient herself without any relief. Twenty months later, a dermatologist diagnosed the lesion as paronychia and treated it with nail avulsions repeatedly with no obvious alleviation. A lesionectomy confirmed the lesion was SCC. An extended excision of the tumor with amputation of the distal interphalangeal joint was subsequently performed. A biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes was negative. Due to the result of preoperative positron emission tomography-computed tomography scanning, sweeping of axillary lymph nodes was considered dispensable and was skipped. At the 2-year follow-up, the patient showed a quick recovery and no sign of recurrence."
