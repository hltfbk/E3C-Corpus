  "text": "A 10-year-old Ecuadorian Mestizo girl with ring chromosome 4 was clinically, cytogenetically and molecularly analysed. Clinical examination revealed congenital anomalies, including microcephaly, prominent nose, micrognathia, low set ears, bilateral clinodactyly of the fifth finger, small sacrococcygeal dimple, short stature and mental retardation. Cytogenetic studies showed a mosaic karyotype, mos 46,XX,r(4)(p16.3q35.2)/46,XX, with a ring chromosome 4 from 75 to 79% in three studies conducted over ten years. These results were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Loss of 1.7 Mb and gain of 342 kb in 4p16.3 and loss of 3 Mb in 4q35.2 were identified by high-resolution mapping array."
