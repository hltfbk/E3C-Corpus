  "text": "We report the case of a 30-year-old nulliparous black woman with a history of mesenteric cystic lymphangioma and multiple bowel resections leading to chronic malabsorption. During her pregnancy, our patient presented with an occlusive syndrome and major bilateral renal dilation. Urinary derivation resulted in iatrogenic bilateral ureteral perforation. Our patient thus presented with major uroperitoneum, bilateral pleural effusion and acute renal failure, treated by thoracic drainage and bilateral nephrostomy. Postoperative pain required treatment with level III analgesics. In this context, 5 days after morphine treatment introduction an enlarged fetal bladder was observed, followed 3 days later by voluminous fetal ascites. The diagnosis of spontaneous bladder rupture was suspected. After multidisciplinary discussion, expectant management was decided. At 31 weeks and 4 days gestation, our patient went into spontaneous labor with a subsequent vaginal delivery. The infant required resuscitation and paracentesis of ascites at birth. Her neonatal course was favorable with a simple urethral bladder drainage. Cystography at day 9 was normal. At 2 years of follow-up, the mother and the child have a normal course."
