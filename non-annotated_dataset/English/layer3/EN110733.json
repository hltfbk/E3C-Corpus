  "text": "An 85-year-old man presented with gross hematuria, and a papillary tumor in the prostatic urethra that was diagnosed as ductal carcinoma of the prostate following transurethral resection. Genetic analysis found an APC mutation with loss of heterozygosity. Immunostaining revealed focal nuclear translocation of β-catenin. APC mutations associated with loss of β-catenin degradation in the Wnt signaling pathway and result in over accumulation of β-catenin are thought to increase mortality. In this patient, β-catenin migrated into tumor cell nuclei."
