  "text": "A 28 year-old primipara has been referred by her obstetician to the radiology department to undergo fetal MRI because hyperechoic mass in the left lung had been detected on an ultrasound examination performed at 22 weeks of amenorrhea. A repeat ultrasonography showed a hyperechoic mass in the left lung and the combination of color Doppler ultrasound allowed visualization of a vessel arising from the descending aorta, which supplied the mass. The diaphragm was of normal appearance on US. The diagnosis of extralobar pulmonary sequestration was made. Magnetic resonance imaging was also performed using a 1.5 Tesla magnetic field, with multiplanar T2 single-shot turbo spin echo sequences. It revealed a well-defined triangular mass with homogeneous high-signal intensity when compared with normal lung tissue in the left down lung field, which was compatible with pulmonary sequestration. MRI did not show any diaphragm or other thoracic abnormality. A male newbon was spontaneously delivered at 38 weeks and was asymptomatic at birth. Postnatal CT scan shows a homogeneous mass in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe. The infant underwent surgery at 12 months because of persistence of the masse and intraoperative photograph obtained shows ectopic masse inferior to the lung with a vascular supply from the descending aorta."
