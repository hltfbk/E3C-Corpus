  "text": "A 65-year-old man presented with a painful swelling of his right lower leg. The pain started insidiously 6 months earlier, it was constant with hyperesthesia of the overlying skin, exacerbated by movements or upon palpation and reduced by rest and had increased in severity over the past 2 months. Physical examination revealed on palpation of the right lower leg a painful soft mass adherent to the deep layer measuring 2cm in diameter. The overlying skin was normal without any evidence of inflammation. Range of motion of the right leg was within normal limits. Neurological examination of the right lower limb was normal. Biology, including complete blood count, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were within normal limits. Plain radiographs show thickening of the soft tissues without bone involvement. Ultrasound shows the presence of an echogenic, heterogeneous, rounded soft tissue mass, well demarcated measuring 17mm in diameter consisting with a nerve tumor. Surgical resection of the mass was performed and histological analysis concluded to a GT. A good outcome at 1 year post-operatively was observed with complete disappearance of pain without any evidence of recurrence."
