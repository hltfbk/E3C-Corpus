  "text": "We report the case of a 61-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with multiple myeloma and dialysis-dependent acute renal failure, with serum kappa free light chain concentrations of 15,700 mg/litre (normal range 3.3 to 19.4 mg/litre). Renal biopsy demonstrated cast nephropathy with waxy casts in distal tubules and collecting ducts. There was an interstitial inflammatory cell infiltrate with diffuse fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Following rehydration, chemotherapy and free light chain removal using high cut-off haemodialysis, free light chain concentrations fell to less than 5% of the starting level (500 mg/litre). A repeat renal biopsy 6 weeks after the first showed resolution of cast nephropathy."
