  "text": "The patient is a 32 year-old male, who at age 29 enrolled in a study evaluating palovarotene to prevent HO formation in FOP. One year after starting palovarotene, he fell resulting in a left intertrochanteric fracture. He underwent intramedullary nailing of the femur shaft with screw placement at the distal femur. After surgery, he received palovarotene at 20 mg/day for 4 weeks, then 10 mg/day for 8 weeks. Imaging 12 weeks after surgery showed new bridging HO at the site of intramedullary rod insertion and distal screw. Nine months after the left hip fracture, the patient had a second fall resulting in a subdural hematoma, left parietal bone fracture, and right intertrochanteric fracture. He underwent intramedullary nailing of the right hip, in a modified procedure which did not require distal screw placement. Palovarotene 20 mg/day was started at fracture occurrence and continued for 4 weeks, then reduced to 10 mg/day for 8 weeks. HO also formed near the insertion site of the intramedullary rod. No HO developed at the right distal intramedullary rod. After each fracture, the patient had prolonged recurrent flare-ups around the hips."
