  "text": "An eight-year-old girl was run over by a motor vehicle and transferred to the emergency department of the local hospital. Her diagnoses were severe blunt hepatic injury (grade IV) with left femoral trochanteric fracture. No other organ injuries were observed. Because her hemodynamic state was stable under aggressive fluid resuscitation, she was transferred to our hospital for surgical management. On arrival at our institution about 4 h after the injury, her hemodynamic condition became unstable. Abdominal compartment syndrome also became apparent. Because her condition had deteriorated and the lethal triad of low BT, coagulopathy, and acidosis was observed, a DC treatment strategy was selected. First, emergent laparotomy was performed for gauze-packing hemostasis to control intractable bleeding from the liver bed, and the abdomen was temporarily closed with a plastic sheet with continuous negative pressure aspiration. Transarterial embolization of the posterior branch of the right hepatic artery was then carried out immediately after the operation. The lacerated right lobe of the liver was safely resected in a stable hemodynamic condition 2 days after the initial operation. Bleeding from the liver bed ceased without further need of hemostasis. She was transferred to the local hospital without any surgical complications on day 42 after admission. She had returned to her normal life by 3 months after the injury."
