  "text": "A 69-year-old Japanese woman was clinically diagnosed with rectosigmoid cancer. Unexpectedly, preoperative examination revealed asymptomatic stenosis of the great artery, which was diagnosed as middle aortic syndrome. Because radical colectomy requires dissection of vessels that supply blood flow to the legs, a vascular stent was inserted prior to operation. We chose SLC due to the reduced risk of damaging epigastric arteries, which may eventually become collaterals in the event of stent re-stenosis. We accomplished SLC with CME, and the patient was discharged on the tenth day after operation without complications."
