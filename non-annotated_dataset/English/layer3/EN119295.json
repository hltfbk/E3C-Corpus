  "text": "A 51-year-old woman presented with post-coital and post-menopausal bleeding. Biopsy of a friable lesion in the proximal endocervical canal revealed an endocervical adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type with widespread squamous metaplasia. The latter feature initially raised the possible diagnosis of a primary endometrial adenocarcinoma. However, immunohistochemical marker studies indicated a diagnosis of primary endocervical adenocarcinoma of endometrioid type and this was confirmed at hysterectomy."
