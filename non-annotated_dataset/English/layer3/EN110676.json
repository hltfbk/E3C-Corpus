  "text": "In this report, we describe a 12-year-old boy who presented with polyarthritis, hyperuricaemia and tophi with a family history of 8 affected individuals. Clinical data, blood and urine samples of 3 affected members and 8 unaffected members were collected. Genetic testing of the eight genes (UMOD, HPRT1, PRPS1, MTHFR, REN, HNF1b, URAT1 and G6PC) was performed using Sanger sequencing. A heterozygous missense variant (c.674C > G; p.T225R) in UMOD was found in this boy, his older brother with the same phenotype and his mother with hyperuricaemia, gout and chronic kidney disease."
