  "text": "We present a case of a 40-year-old White British female with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) who mobilized in a wheelchair and presented to our center in April 2016 with a week-long history of a hot, swollen, and unstable right forearm. Plain radiographs demonstrated fractures of both the radius and ulna of the dominant right arm. These were managed by open reduction and internal fixation to facilitate mobility and transfer using the forearm. Intra-operatively, these were confirmed to be fatigue fractures, and there was evidence that the fracture was several days old. The neurological deficit in this patient had led to a delayed presentation owing to the lack of pain. Unfortunately, this construct failed within 8days, and a refixation was performed 2months later. 1year following the revision, no further problems have been reported, and there has been satisfactory union."
