  "text": "A 35-year-old non-smoking African man experienced a 2-week history of painless, profuse and persistent gross hematuria. Laboratory tests showed normal renal function, hematuria and mild proteinuria. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography revealed no renal abnormalities; the bladder appeared pristine under cystoscopy. The diagnosis of sickle cell trait associated with gross hematuria was made using hemoglobin electrophoresis; renal biopsy and its complications were avoided. Urine was clear after 2Â weeks of oral hydration and gamma epsilon-aminocaproic acid."
