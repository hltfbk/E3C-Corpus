  "text": "A 68-year-old presented with a four weeks history of painful, persistent erection and inability to pass urine. He denied any preceding intake of erection-enhancing medications or exposure to trauma. He was not a known sickle cell disease patient. He admitted to a history of weight loss, asthenia and loss of appetite. However, he presented with no hematuria or abdominal pain and had never been admitted in the past. Examination revealed that the penis was erect to about 90Â°, rigid, stained and necrotic. Hemoglobin was 10 g/dl, the white cell count was 7. Electrolyte, urea and creatinine were normal. Total penectomy was performed. Corpus cavernosa aspiration cytologie were positive for malignant cells. Enhanced chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a left renal tumor with pulmonary and hepatic metastases. Renal mass biopsy revealed clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The patient was transferred to the oncology department. Unfortunately, he continued to deteriorate and died of his disease 4 months later."
