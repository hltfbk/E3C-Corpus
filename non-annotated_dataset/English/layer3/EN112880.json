  "text": "An 86-year-old female was referred to the emergency department for unrelieved chest tightness, shortness of breath and back pain. Cardiac biomarkers were mildly elevated and electrocardiogram displayed pathologic Q-waves, ST-segment elevation and inverted T-waves. Unexpectedly, coronary angiography was in absence of obstructed coronary atherosclerosis or acute plaque rupture. Chest computed tomography illustrated multiple pulmonary emboli in bilateral pulmonary arteries. She had suffered from long-term right lower extremity pain and experienced a long railway journey with less activity. Both echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance demonstrated regional hypokinesia of left ventricle. She received anticoagulant and diuretic therapies, three-month follow up after discharge revealed uneventful recovery without any pulmonary emboli or regional motion abnormalities, thus she was retrospectively diagnosed with TTS caused by PE."
