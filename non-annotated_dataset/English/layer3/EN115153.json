  "text": "This case report describes a 6 years-old girl with febrile neutropenia during the treatment of neuroblastoma. Blood culture showed Candida sp. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed multiple unspecific hypoechoic areas of variable sizes in spleen, which might be either tumor or Candida-induced abscesses. [(18)F]FDG-PET/CT was performed to help the diagnosis and revealed small splenic lesions highly suggestive of disseminated candidiasis. Patient was then treated with systemic antifungal agent. After the recovery from febrile neutropenia, a spleen biopsy was performed, confirming the diagnosis of fungal abscess. Due to the small size of lesions, modalities such as ultrasonography, CT and magnetic nuclear resonance were not able in distinguishing tumor relapse from infectious lesions."
