  "text": "A 32 year old male with short stature who has undergone bilateral cataract surgery 2 years ago but who was otherwise healthy, presented with fever and generalized body aches of 3 days duration and carpal spasms/tetany occurring on the third day of the illness. He was diagnosed to have acute dengue fever along with severe hypocalcemia. Subsequent workup confirmed that the patient had primary hypoparathyroidism with extensive basal ganglia and cerebellar calcifications which was previously undiagnosed. His acute illness and hypocalcemia was managed successfully and was commenced on regular calcium supplementations to alleviate the hypocalcemic effects of his chronic illness."
