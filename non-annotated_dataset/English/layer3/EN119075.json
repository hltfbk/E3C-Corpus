  "text": "A 67-year-old woman presented with epigastric fullness, mild jaundice and weight loss with a history of a bowel resection 7 years prior for a primary GIST of the small bowel. The finding of a heterogeneous mass 15.5 cm in diameter replacing most of the left lobe of the liver by ultrasonography and CT, followed by positive cytological studies revealed a metastatic GIST. Perioperative optimization of the patient's nutritional status along with biliary drainage, and portal vein embolization were performed. Imatinib was successful in reducing the tumor size and facilitating surgical resection."
