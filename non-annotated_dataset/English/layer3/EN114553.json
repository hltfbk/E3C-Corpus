  "text": "The patient is a 63-year-old Chinese male with advanced EHCC, taking sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. On the tenth day, red maculopapules appeared all over the body. On the same day, the patient began to suffer from continuous high fever. Due to these effects, the patient was asked to cease sorafenib treatment, and the high fever and maculopapules were alleviated quickly. However, the symptoms were present again upon re-challenge of sorafenib. Prednisone was then administered to control the symptoms, with the dosage gradually reduced from 30 to 5 mg/day in 1.5 months. No recurrence of fever or maculopapules has been found. Tumor response reached partial response (PR) and progression free survival (PFS) reached 392 days + by the date of Apr. 14th, 2016."
