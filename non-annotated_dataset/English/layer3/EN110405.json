  "text": "A nine-year-old male child known homozygous \\(HbSS), diagnosed in infancy, presented at the Emergency Paediatrics unit of the hospital with a two weeks history of polyuria and polydipsia; four days history of abdominal pain, abdominal distension and constipation. There was no family history of diabetes mellitus. Examination findings revealed a severe level of dehydration, respiratory distress (Kussmaul's breathing), subnormal axillary temperature of 35.4 Â° C, and mild pallor with oxygen saturation of 92% (Finger pulse oximetry). He had abdominal distension with mild generalised tenderness and reduced bowel sounds. Other systemic examinations findings were unremarkable. Anthropometric indices were low for age; the weight of 21kg (less than the fifth percentile), a height of 127cm (12.5 th percentile), body mass index of 13kg/m 2 (less than the fifth percentile) and body surface area of 0.86m 2. Random blood glucose at presentation was 32.2 mmol/L \\(580mg/dL) and urine was positive for glucose, ketone and nitrite. The admitting total WBC were 17.8 x 10 9 /L, neutrophils 71.8%, lymphocytes 22.4%, monocytes 2.9%, eosinophils 0.7%, basophils 2.2%, platelets 154 x 10 9 /L and Hb of 7.4 g/dL. Urine culture was sterile after 24hrs of incubation.\nHe received a bolus of 0.9% normal saline at 20ml/kg over one hour and subsequently rehydrated over 24 hours (half of the total deficit given in the first eight hours and the remaining deficit with maintenance over subsequent 16 hours). Soluble insulin was commenced after the second hour at rate of 0.1unit/kg/min and later reduced to 0.05 units/kg/min due to precipitous fall in glucose. The co-existing VOC crisis was managed with nasogastric tube drainage of the stomach and analgesia and resolved after 72 hours of admission. Intravenous Ceftriaxone was given to treat precipitating urinary tract infection. Acidosis resolved after 36 hours and insulin was changed to subcutaneous premixed insulin (70/30) and discharged on 1 unit/kg/day after 12days on admission. At the follow up a week later, the self-monitoring blood glucose record ranges from 3.5 to 16mmo/L in a stable state."
