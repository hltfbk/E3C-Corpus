  "text": "A 40 year old woman was diagnosed with metastatic YWHAE-FAM22 translocated endometrial stromal sarcoma. She was treated successively with doxorubicin, megestrol acetate and anastrozole, before pazopanib was initiated. Several dose interruptions and reductions were necessary due to liver toxicity, but nevertheless she had a good partial response. Seven months after the start, pazopanib was permanently stopped because of a bilateral pneumothorax. Nine months later it was reinitiated because of progression and was continued for another 8 months until final disease progression."
