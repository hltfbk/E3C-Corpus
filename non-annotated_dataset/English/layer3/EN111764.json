  "text": "A 60-year-old woman had a right femoral shaft fracture due to a traffic accident, and she immediately underwent closed reduction and internal fixation surgery with an intramedullary nailing. However, after 6 mo of rehabilitation, the fracture site showed no signs of healing, and her condition was diagnosed as atrophic nonunion. Subsequently, teriparatide was administered for 6 mo. Complete union was observed at the fracture site 6 mo after teriparatide discontinued."
