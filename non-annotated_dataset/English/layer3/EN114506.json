  "text": "A 27-year-old P1 G2 (second pregnancy one live birth) patient presented at 30 weeks gestation with a massive vulval lesion. She was HIV seropositive and taking anti-retroviral therapy. She was anemic with a hemoglobin level of 5.9 and was transfused 4.0 of packed cells. She underwent examination under anesthesia and vulval biopsy. She went into preterm labor and was delivered by cesarean section. Unfortunately, the baby had died while receiving corticosteroid therapy. The histopathological report confirmed a Kaposi's sarcoma, and she was referred to oncologists for chemotherapy."
