  "text": "We report on the case of a 49-year old male patient who presented with suddenly experienced dyspnea. Besides bilateral pulmonary arterial embolism, a lesion close to the head of the pancreas was found using CT scan, infiltrating the infrahepatic IVC. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed a low-grade LMS. Intraoperatively, a tumor of the IVC was observed without infiltration of surrounding organs or distant metastases. Consequently, the tumor was removed successfully, by en-bloc resection including prosthetic graft placement of the IVC. Histological workup revealed a completely resected (R0) moderately differentiated LMS of the IVC."
