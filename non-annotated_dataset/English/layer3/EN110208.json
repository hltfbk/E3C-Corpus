  "text": "A 67-year-old Arab man with an 8-years history of untreated gout was admitted for generalized articular pain. Our patient had only taken traditional medicines for joint pains and did not resort to specific therapy for gout. He was noted to have multiple hard swelling. The swelling developed over 4 years, progressively increasing in size. There was no family history of gout, but personal history of alcohol use, and high purine diet intake. Physical examination revealed that there were multiple large firm tophi over bilateral hands, feet, elbows, and knees.Some of them are ulcerated and discharged white chalky material. He had an average built with BMI of 30,4 and hypertension fortuitously discovered.\nLaboratory workup revealed elevated serum uric acid (96 mg/l, normal: 20-74 mg/l), with normal renal function test: blood urea 0,4mg/l (normal: 0, 1- 0,5 mg/l) and serum creatinine 10mg/l (normal: 5-18 mg/l). Radiological examination of both hands showed soft-tissue swelling and periarticular erosions in interphalangeal joints. Radiological examination of the feet showed soft tissue swelling and total destruction of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint.Abdominal ultrasonography revealed bilateral caliceal calculi.\nThe patient was treated with Allopurinol (100mg/day) associated to Colchicine (1mg/day). After 3 days, he experienced relief of the joints pain. Then he was referred to urology care for his kidney stones."
