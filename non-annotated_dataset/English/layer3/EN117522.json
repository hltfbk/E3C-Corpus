  "text": "A 21-year-old nulliparous Greek woman presented with chronic noncyclic pelvic pain, and a retrorectal cyst was diagnosed. The lesion was resected through a laparotomy and, on histologic examination, was found to be an endometrioid cyst. The treatment was completed with a six-month course of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue. One year after surgery, the woman remained free of symptoms, and pelvic imaging showed no recurrence of the lesion. Reviewing the literature, we found only three previous reports of an endometrioid cyst in this anatomic location."
