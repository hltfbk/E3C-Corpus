  "text": "We present a case of Wegener's granulomatosis with unusual endoscopic appearance, involvement in a young man's gastrointestinal tract. A 45-year-old man was diagnosed with Wegener's granulomatosis 11Â years ago, and relapsed with abdominal pain and melena. A colonoscopy was performed, and the appearance of mucosal lesions with an unusual annular black membrane was observed. A black ring-shaped membranous tissue adhered to the surface of the colon wall, which could be traversed by an endoscopic forepart."
