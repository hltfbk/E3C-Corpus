  "text": "This case report describes a previously apparently well 36-year-old Sri Lankan Sinhalese man who presented with an acute febrile illness with myalgia, with liver involvement in the form of transaminitis, cardiac involvement in the form of myocarditis, acute kidney injury, and pulmonary involvement. He was initially managed as severe leptospirosis with multiorgan dysfunction with antibiotics, steroids, and N-acetyl cysteine. A diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection was made subsequently. He made an uneventful recovery."
