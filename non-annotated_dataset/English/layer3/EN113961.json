  "text": "We present a case of occult dural injury with endocranial complications which occurred in a 34 year old man, with a history of head injury forty-three years ago. The patient presented with a triad of findings; meningitis, CSF rhinorrhoea and pneumocephalus. He was managed conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and observation and made a full recovery. The presence of acute endocranial symptoms and particularly these three findings in a patient with a previous history of head injury, no matter how long it had been should raise suspicion of the presence of an occult dural injury."
