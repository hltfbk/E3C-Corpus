  "text": "A 65-year-old female whom took lactate calcium tablets for 5Â years presented with progressive dysphagia. A whitish esophageal mass with an appearance of a pharmacobezoar was detected at esophagoscopy. A pedunculated tumor was considered in the differential diagnosis, but the imagistic studies ruled out a pedicle. This intraluminal esophageal mass highly suggestive for a pharmacobezoar was endoscopically removed. The challenge of correct diagnosis was raised by histological examination performed after immersion into trichloracetic acid for decalcification. The identification of hyaline fibrous tissue, with numerous crystalline basophils deposits of minerals, rare fibrocytes and very few vessels brought in discussion a mesenchymal originating mass, most likely a fibrovascular polyp, even the pedicle was not detected."
