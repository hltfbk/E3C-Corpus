  "text": "A 12-month-old Thai girl presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and bacterial pneumonia. Although supported with mechanical ventilation, she still had severe hypoxia. She was then transitioned to high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. During a weaning period on day 7, she developed left tension pneumothorax requiring intercostal drainage and a markedly large amount of pneumoperitoneum. In spite of a bedside abdominocentesis, her abdomen was still tense and her hemodynamics was unstable. Subsequently, to exclude hollow viscus perforation, diaphragmatic injury caused by intercostal drainage, or abdominal compartment syndrome, she was transferred for surgery. There was no intestinal perforation. Postoperatively, she was on oxygen therapy, on chest physical therapy, and kept hemodynamically stable until she had recovered."
