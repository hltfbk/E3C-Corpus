  "text": "We present four cases of MD confirmed by surgery. They were all adult males with ages going from 18 to 50 years, referred to our service from 2004 to 2018, due to obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). They had a history of 1 mo to 10 years of overt and occult bleeding episodes. Laboratory blood test showed an iron-deficiency anemia from 4 to 9 g/dL of hemoglobin that required multiple hospitalizations and blood transfusions in all cases. Repeated upper digestive endoscopies and colonoscopies were negative. Small bowel was examined with VCE, which revealed double lumen images in all cases, one with polyps and three with circumferential ulcers in the diverticulum. However, based on VCE findings, preoperative diagnosis of MD was suggested only in two patients. Capsule was retained in one patient, which was recovered with surgery. The anatomopathological report revealed ulcerated ectopic gastric mucosa in all cases."
