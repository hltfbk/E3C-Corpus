  "text": "A 67-year-old Japanese man was hospitalized at our institution with heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. On day after discharge, he developed cerebral infarction and showed persistence of multiple left ventricular thrombi. His paralysis completely improved at 2 days after edaravone and heparin administration; however, his left visual field defect persisted."
