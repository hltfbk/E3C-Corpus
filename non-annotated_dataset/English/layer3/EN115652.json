  "text": "We describe the first known case of a 56-year-old Caucasian male with an anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in which the entire procedure was carried out with the patient being in persistent ventricular fibrillation (VF) resistant to defibrillation on ECMO support. Subsequent to revascularization, the patient's cardiac rhythm converted back to sinus rhythm with a single defibrillation shock with excellent neurologic recovery."
