  "text": "We report an 84-year-old woman who presented with fever and altered mentality, which was confirmed as SFTS with encephalopathy by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in blood and cerebrospinal fluid. The SFTSV was also identified in the tick that bit her, H. longicornis. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the SFTSV from the patient and the tick was identical. The patient gradually recovered with treatments of corticosteroids and immunoglobulin."
