  "text": "A 31-year-old female patient with a known case of SCD presented to our ER in King Fahad hospital Hofuf in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with a history of generalized body ache, exertional dyspnoea, headache and easy fatigability for a few days on a background history of episodic hospital admissions for SCD, but she was admitted 3 times over the previous 6 months and received 6 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The last blood transfusion was 18 days earlier. She was sick and her Hb level was 4.5 g/dL with positive Coombs test and positive alloantibodies, diagnosed as DHTR. We treated her with prednisolone tablets 1 mg/kg daily, intravenous immunoglobulins, 0.4 gm/kg daily for 5 days, and rituximab 500 mg IV every week for 4 weeks. Her Hb level raised up to 8.2 g/dL and she was discharged in good condition."
