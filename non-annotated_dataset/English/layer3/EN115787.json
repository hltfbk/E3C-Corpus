  "text": "A 39-year-old man required sigmoidectomy for serosal invasive advanced sigmoid colon cancer. HIPEC with oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C were given as adjuvant therapy. Subsequently, intestinal obstruction developed at 15 months postoperatively, and the patient was hospitalized. Abdominal computed tomography showed a dilated small intestine enveloped by a thickened membrane. We found no evidence of peritoneal recurrence, but exploratory surgery revealed EPS, probably caused by HIPEC. We peeled the capsule off of the intestine. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and sufficient nutritional intake after surgery was noted. Seven months after surgery, he is well with no recurrence."
