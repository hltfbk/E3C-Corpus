  "text": "We present a case of a 53-year old African American female with a history of hyperthyroidism secondary to a complete hydatidiform mole and an associated finding of a mature cystic ovarian teratoma. She presented with nausea, vomiting, nervousness, weight gain, abdominal pain and a b-hCG of greater than 450,000mIU/mL. A total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was performed and curative for her symptoms. Lung nodules were noted with slight increases in b-hCG levels in the months following the surgery. Propranolol and methimazole were used to treat the acute hyperthyroid symptoms."
