  "text": "A 64-year-old Taiwanese man presented to the emergency department complaining of severe right chest pain after a traffic accident. Chest radiography showed right fifth to eighth rib fractures and was suspicious for free air under the bilateral hemi-diaphragm. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed interposition of bowel loops between the liver and diaphragm. The patient was treated with oral analgesics and then regularly followed in the outpatient department."
