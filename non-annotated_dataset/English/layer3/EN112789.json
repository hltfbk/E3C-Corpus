  "text": "Seventeen years ago, a 45-year-old lady was admitted to our hospital due to coxarthrosis secondary to developmental hip dysplasia. In six months interval, she underwent bilateral THA with Exeterâ„¢ Universal Hip system.She had re-operated on her 3rd year because of right femoral stem fracture.Since then, she has beenexamined at the outpatient clinic regularly on1-year-based intervals. There was no trauma or obvious activity experienced. Radiographs of the pelvis and bilateral femur were obtained, andit was demonstrated that both femoral stems were broken. Both fractured stems were removed by extended femoral osteotomy via a lateral approach.Intraoperative examination revealedthat the right acetabular component was well-fixed, but there was a loosening of the left acetabularcomponent. The acetabular revision was performed to the left side. Echelon cementless revision hip system (Smith and Nephew) was used for the right and left sides. The patient was stood-up on the first post-operative day and weight-bearing was permitted as much as tolerated. At the end of 6 weeks, full weight bearing was permitted. She was returned to her routine daily life activities after 4 months."
