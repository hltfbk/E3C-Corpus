  "text": "A 22-year-old African gentleman presented with left nasal obstruction and epistaxis for 2 years and was diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. He subsequently underwent embolization of the maxillary branch of the left ECA using Embozene® Microspheres - 250 μm in size before endoscopic tumour excision to reduce intra-operative bleeding. He complained of sudden painless profound visual loss in the left eye (LE) two hours after embolization. Visual acuity in LE was no light perception. Fundus examination showed pale retina with no cherry red spot. Arterial narrowing and segmentation were seen in all quadrants. A diagnosis of left ophthalmic artery occlusion was made. Despite immediate management including ocular massage and lowering of intraocular pressure, the visual loss remained. Retrospective review of digital subtraction angiogram showed an anastomosis between the left ophthalmic artery and anterior deep temporal artery as a potential route for microspheres migration."
