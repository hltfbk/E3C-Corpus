  "text": "A 68-year-old lady with a stage IV FTMH underwent pars plana vitrectomy with 25 gauge plus transconjunctival system, ILM peeling and gas tamponade. The inverted ILM flap technique was adopted, except that no extra surgical manipulation was used to cover the macular hole with the ILM flap. Surgical outcome was monitored with serial optical coherence tomography (OCT). Complete closure of the FTMH with resolution of intraretinal cystic changes was confirmed on OCT at 16 months postoperatively. Visual acuity improved from a baseline level of 0.1 to 0.4."
