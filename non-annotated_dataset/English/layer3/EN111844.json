  "text": "A 54-year-old male presented with acute painful locking of knee after his knee struck on the edge of the bed while trying to attain a kneeling position on the bed. On clinical examination, the superior pole of patella protruded anteriorly and was very tender. The patellar tendon was found to be intact. Radiographs confirmed the diagnosis of superior dislocation of patella. The dislocation was reduced by closed method using intramuscular analgesia. The knee was immobilized for three weeks in a posterior long knee brace."
