  "text": "This report presents a case of angiolipoma that developed in the right bronchus intermedius of a 68-year-old man. A chest CT revealed a 10-mm endobronchial mass that was clearly visible as a high-attenuation area of contrast enhancement. Bronchoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor on the anterior wall of the entrance to the right bronchus intermedius that was constricting the airway lumen. The tumor surface was covered with numerous engorged blood vessels, and the middle and inferior pulmonary lobes were intact. Bronchial sleeve resection of the right bronchus intermedius was performed. Histologically, a mixture of proliferating blood vessels and adipocytes were observed within the bronchus wall. Therefore, the pathological diagnosis was angiolipoma. Lung function was preserved, and complete resection of the tumor was achieved. At present (2 years and 7 months after surgery), the patient is recurrence-free."
