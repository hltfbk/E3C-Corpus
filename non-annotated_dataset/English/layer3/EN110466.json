  "text": "A 45-year-old patient, treated for 20 years for psoriatic rheumatism using immunosuppressant drugs, who has checked for paraesthesia's of the four-limb and gait difficulty that have been evolving over the last 3 months. Clinical examination revealed extensive skin lesions on the trunk and on all four limbs in the form of rounded or polycyclic red patches and a pyramidal tract syndrome with predominantly left-sided muscle weakness. Standard X-rays of the cervical spine showed subtotal pinching of the C3-C4 intervertebral space with C3 posterior wall recoil. Dynamic X-rays showed obvious C1-C2 instability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed damage to the transverse ligament resulting in C1-C2 dislocation (increased space between the odontoid and posterior arch of C1) and the presence of retrolisthesis of C3 relative to C4 with signs of spinal cord compression at this level. The patient had an instrumented posterior arthrodesis C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 associated with laminectomy C3, C4 and C5. At 6 months follow-up, the evolution was satisfactory with a complete neurological recovery and a good stability of the upper cervical spine."
