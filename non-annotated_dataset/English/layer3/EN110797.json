  "text": "40 years old male and 32 years old female underwent standard PNL for partial and total staghorn calculi, respectively. During the procedure in both cases, the renal pelvis was injured. In both cases, JJ stent was used to drain the collecting system. Trial to remove the JJ stent 6 weeks following the procedure failed because the upper coils of the stents were embedded in the fibrous tissues at the perforation site. Laser incision of the fibrous tissues and releasing the upper coil of the stents were performed using percutaneous approach in the first case and flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS) in the second patient. The procedures were uneventful in both cases."
