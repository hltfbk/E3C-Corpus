  "text": "A 59-year-old male presented in our unit with nephrotic syndrome. He had a history of primary antiphospholipid syndrome with lupus anticoagulant treated with vitamin K antagonist therapy. On admission, antiphospholipid (lupus anticoagulant) and anti-PLA2R antibodies were positive. Screening for secondary etiologies was negative. In the context of primary antiphospholipid syndrome treated with vitamin K antagonist therapy, we did not perform a biopsy and we treated the patient with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor. No remission was observed at 6 months with persistent anti-PLA2R antibodies while antiphospholipid antibody level became negative. Consequently, kidney biopsy was performed showing both membranous nephropathy with PLA2R in deposits on immunohistochemistry with IgG4 dominance and antiphospholipid syndrome chronic vascular nephropathy. Following that, treatment with rituximab was started with secondarily a decrease in serum PLA2R antibody levels and partial remission."
