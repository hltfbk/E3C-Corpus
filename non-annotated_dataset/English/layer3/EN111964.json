  "text": "Here, we report the case of patient with NEC showing an aggressive growth pattern that resulted in the rupture of the tumor to the outside the colon after stenting of the internal colonic stenosis. In addition, the tumor invaded into the duodenum, thereby causing duodenal stenosis that required an additional stent in the duodenum. This aggressive growth pattern is one of the main features of the NEC that is different from adenocarcinoma. To clarify the clinical characteristics, we reviewed 60 recently reported cases, including data on tumor location, size, treatment, and prognosis."
