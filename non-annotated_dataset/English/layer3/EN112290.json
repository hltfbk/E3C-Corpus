  "text": "A 64-year-old man was diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in the upper esophagus at clinical Stage IIB (cT1bN1M0) according to the UICC-TNM classification 7th edition. First, we planned the preceding cervical procedure to complete upper mediastinal lymph node dissection, as the DAA prevented a bilateral thoracic approach to the upper mediastinum. We then planned the left thoracoscopic procedure to perform lymph node dissection below the left aortic arch, as the patient in our case had a right side-dominant DAA and right-sided descending aorta, as is common in such patients. We identified the bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerves during upper mediastinal lymph node dissection in the preceding cervical procedure and ultimately successfully resected the patient's esophageal cancer."
