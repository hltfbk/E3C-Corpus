  "text": "We report a case of right-sided renal cell carcinoma with simultaneous bilateral adrenal metastases in a 58-year-old woman. The primary tumor was localized in the upper and mid pole of the kidney. The diagnosis was established preoperatively by abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography. Surgical treatment consisted of a right radical nephrectomy and bilateral adrenalectomy. Postoperative cortisone acetate replacement was instituted. The pathological findings of the right renal tumor showed clear cell carcinoma and both adrenal tumors showed the same pathology as the right renal tumor. There was no evidence of recurrence after 6 months of follow-up."
