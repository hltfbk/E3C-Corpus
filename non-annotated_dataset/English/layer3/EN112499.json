  "text": "A 61-year-old Indonesian man presented with typical angina that began 1 week before admission and had worsened 3â€‰hours prior to admission. Accompanying symptoms included dyspnea, nausea, and sweating. He was hemodynamically stable and had a history of tobacco smoking and dyslipidemia. An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment depression and T inversion. Laboratory results showed an international normalized ratio of 1.28. Dual antiplatelet therapy was administered along with fondaparinux, and symptoms were alleviated. Coronary angiography showed an ectatic and turbulent mid-distal right coronary artery and slow flow at the first presentation. There was a patent stent in the proximal-mid left anterior descending coronary artery. This patient had previously presented with recurrent acute coronary syndrome and received two coronary stents for the stenotic vessels."
