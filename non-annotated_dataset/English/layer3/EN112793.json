  "text": "An 8-year-old female child presented with pain and swelling in the left knee. Radiological examination suggested of a lytic lesion in upper tibia along with reactive synovial thickening. The lytic lesion was excised and an incisional biopsy was taken from the hyperplastic synovium. Histopathological examination of the synovial tissue showed villi-like structures with mature adipose tissue expanding the synovial lining along with the presence of mild chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. The lytic lesion showed a cartilaginous tumor comprising mineralized chicken wire matrix surrounding the chondroblasts. A final diagnosis of synovial lipomatosis with chondroblastoma was made on histopathological examination."
