  "text": "In this case report, we present a male infant of Polish origin, whose symptoms and laboratory findings (including metabolic acidosis) were strongly suggestive of metabolic disease other than cystic fibrosis. Newborn screening for CF was positive, but the first sweat test results were equivocal, and initial and extended molecular tests were negative. Finally, after considering broad differential diagnosis, introducing treatment specific for CF and excluding other metabolic diseases, a third expanded genetic test revealed the presence of a rare pathogenic mutation in both alleles of the CFTR gene: c.4035_4038dupCCTA (p.Ser1347ProfsX13)."
