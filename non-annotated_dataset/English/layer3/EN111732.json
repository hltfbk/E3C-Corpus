  "text": "A 43 year-old Chinese man with a 13-year history of eosinophilia and shortness of breath for 7 d presented to our hospital. During the course of his illness, the patient variably presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, eczema, vitiligo, mastitis, joint symptoms, nephrotic syndrome, and interstitial pneumonia. The chronic mastitis proved burdensome, necessitating bilateral mastectomy. HE was diagnosed by repeat bone marrow biopsy, and a kidney biopsy showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Intermittent steroidal therapy is typically initiated to relieve such symptoms, although relapse and organ involvement often ensue once treatment is withdrawn. We administered methylprednisolone sodium succinate (40 mg/d) intravenously for 3 d, followed by oral tablets at the same dose. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the chest CT showed relative improvement of the interstitial pneumonia. The patient is currently on a continuous regimen of oral steroid, and his condition is stable."
