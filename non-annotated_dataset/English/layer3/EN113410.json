  "text": "We report an EBV + PTCL in a 9-year-old child with initial symptom of subcutaneous masses without lymph node involvement. Histologically, the neoplastic cells were centroblastoid with round or oval nuclei, slightly condensed chromatin and median eosinophilic inconspicuous nucleoli. Immunohistochemically, all neoplastic cells were positive for CD8, GranzymeB and TIA-1. Two novel variants (S420Y and E623K) were detected in STAT5B."
