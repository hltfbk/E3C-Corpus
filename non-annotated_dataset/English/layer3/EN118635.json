  "text": "We show here a case of malignant combined naevus made up of a blue naevus and a melanoma, presenting as a slowly progressing and asymptomatic pigmented lesion on the trunk of a 35-year-old man. Dermoscopic examination was not conclusive for a malignant lesion, showing only an atypical brown pigment network. The definitive diagnosis was reached only at the hystopathological examination."
