  "text": "A 64-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital because of chronic persistent swallowing dysfunction for 2Â years. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a superficial hypopharyngeal cancer in the right pyriform sinus. We used a transparent hood (Elastic Touch, slit and hole type, M (long), Top company, Tokyo Japan) instead of the curved laryngoscope to create adequate working space by pushing the larynx, and dental floss tied to a haemoclip was applied to create counter traction during ESD. The lesion was pathologically confirmed as superficial squamous cell carcinoma and resected completely."
