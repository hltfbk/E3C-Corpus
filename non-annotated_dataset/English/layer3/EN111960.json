  "text": "An asymptomatic lesion was discovered as an incidental radiographic finding in a 10-year-old boy. The patient had no complaints about the lesion. Cone-beam computerized tomograms revealed a round cavity with a defined cortical border measuring approximately 5 × 5 × 5 mm in size. The lesion was a POT. The patient was treated with enucleation. The tumor showed no recurrence for one year."
