  "text": "A Caucasian male developed recurrent amebic liver abscesses, when aged 23, 27 and 39Â years. Only on the first occasion did this coincide with a recent visit to the tropics. The patient received adequate treatment during each episode. Possible explanations are persistent asymptomatic carrier state, cysts passage in his family, re-infection or chance."
