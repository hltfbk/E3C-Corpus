  "text": "A 32 year-old male with polytrauma was admitted to an intensive care unit after a right-sided nephrectomy and evacuation of retroperitoneal hematoma. The patient initial haemostatic disorder was improved by administration of blood preparations, an anti-fibrinolytic agent and concentrates of fibrinogen. On the third day he presented sudden onset of hemodynamic instability and was incapable of standard CTA diagnostic procedure. Urgent and relevant investigations including transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram confirmed a high-risk PE. PMT was performed due to contraindications for systemic thrombolysis. Long-term PMT was attempted using aspiration with several devices. No major improvement was achieved in any of the treatments and the patient died. Autopsy confirmed a large heterogeneous thrombotic mass in the pulmonary trunk folding to the right main artery. Additional histological analysis revealed a high fibrin-rich content in the peripheral surroundings of the thrombus."
