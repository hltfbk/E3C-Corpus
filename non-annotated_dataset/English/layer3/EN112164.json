  "text": "We present a 24-year-old male patient with Burkitt's lymphoma. After receiving one cycle therapy, he developed severe kidney injury from TLS. We initiated renal replacement therapy soon after his admission to the ICU, with marked response to therapy. This led to early discharge from the ICU."
