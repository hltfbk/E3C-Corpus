  "text": "Our patient is 21 years old, having as antecedents an essential epilepsy, autoregressive at the age of 18 years. Elsewhere, the patient has no history of diabetes or neuropathy, no previous cervicothoracic surgery or arterial catheterization, no history of trauma. He consulted for hypersudation and asymmetrical erythema of the face, lateralized on the right side. This disorder was noted since childhood, during sports efforts and more frequently in the hot season, otherwise the patient does not report other signs including ocular or neurological. The dermatological examination did not show abnormalities, no asymmetry of the face. The neurological examination, including the higher functions were normal, the examination of the cranial pairs especially the facial nerve was unscathed. In order to objectivate the disorder communicated by the patient, a stress test was carried out: after 20-minute race, an erythema appears of the right side of his face, neck and limb was demonstrated, more accentuated in suborbital, where it is finely telangiectatic, with hypersudation contrasting with the absence of erythema and sweat on the contralateral side. The diagnosis of the harlequin syndrome was then retained, and a cervicothoracic Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed not objectifying any abnormalities."
