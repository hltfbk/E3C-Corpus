  "text": "We report the first case of isolated diplopia in a patient being treated for idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis. This is also the first report where the neurotoxicity induced by initial tacrolimus therapy persisted with subsequent cyclosporine therapy, two structurally different calcineurin inhibitors which share a common mechanism of action. In our case toxicity occurred after 3Â months of therapy despite low serum concentrations and the symptoms resolved completely after discontinuation of the drugs."
