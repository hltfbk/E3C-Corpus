  "text": "A 53-year old Caucasian female presented to the Emergency Department for cough, nausea, vomiting and \"feeling sick for 3Â weeks.\" Labs were indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis. Initial electrocardiograms were suggestive of possible myocardial infarction and follow-up echocardiogram showed severely depressed left ventricular systolic function which resolved upon treatment of ketoacidosis."
