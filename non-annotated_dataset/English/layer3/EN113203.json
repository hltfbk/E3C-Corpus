  "text": "We report the case of a 57-year-old man presenting with concomitant acute myeloid leukemia and type B LA with asymptomatic hypoglycemia. We did not find arguments for a septic state, liver dysfunction, or acute mesenteric ischemia. The WE was suspected, and chemotherapy was immediately undertaken. We observed a rapid and sustained decrease in lactate level and normalization of blood glucose. Unfortunately, we noted a relapse of acute leukemia associated with WE soon after treatment initiation and the patient died in the Intensive Care unit."
