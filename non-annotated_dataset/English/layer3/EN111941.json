  "text": "We present three cases of patients with OMS, in whom WB-MRI revealed occult neuroblastic tumor masses, whereas scintigraphy was inconclusive: In a 17 months old girl with OMS, WB-MRI revealed a paravertebral mass. After thoracoscopic resection, histopathology revealed a ganglioneuroblastoma. A 13 months old boy presenting with OMS WB-MRI detected a tumor of the left adrenal gland; histopathology demonstrated a ganglioneuroblastoma after adrenalectomy. In a 2 year old boy with OMS, immunoscintigraphy at the time of diagnosis was inconclusive. At the age of 13 years, a WB-MRI was performed due to persistent neurological symptoms, revealing a paravertebral retroperitoneal mass, which was classified as ganglioneuroblastoma."
