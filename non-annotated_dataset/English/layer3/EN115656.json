  "text": "Here, we describe a rare case of aPAP that was subsequently complicated by microscopic polyangiitis-related pulmonary fibrosis. The patient was a 75-year-old Japanese man diagnosed with aPAP based on the crazy-paving appearance on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), \"milky\" appearance of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and elevated serum levels of the anti-GM-CSF antibody. The patient was followed-up without aPAP-specific treatment for 3 years. During this period, both hematuria and proteinuria appeared; in addition, serum myeloperoxidase (MPO)-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) turned positive and increased markedly. The second BAL performed one year after the diagnosis, showed that the \"milky\" appearance had resolved. The HRCT showed that fibrotic changes had developed and that the crazy-paving appearance had disappeared. These data suggest an association between pulmonary fibrosis that developed during the natural course of aPAP and ANCA-related systemic vasculitis."
