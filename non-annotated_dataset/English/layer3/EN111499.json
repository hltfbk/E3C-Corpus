  "text": "A 61-year-old female patient presented with recurrent epigastric pain for more than 6 mo. On endoscopy, a large amount of food residue was present in the stomach with multiple stones and ulcers in the antro-pyloric region. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of gastrolithiasis was made. However, computed tomography of the abdomen revealed the correct diagnosis of Bouveret syndrome. Initially, endoscopic treatment was attempted but it failed. Later, she was successfully managed by cholecystectomy with duodenal stone extraction and fistula repair (one-step method). At the last follow-up 6 mo after surgery, the patient was symptom-free."
