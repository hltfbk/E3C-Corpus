  "text": "A 24-year-old Middle Eastern woman presented to the author's institution with dysphonia and dyspepsia. She underwent endoscopy and was diagnosed with severe reflux disease. In addition, laryngoscopy revealed a polyp at the left vocal cord, and the patient underwent polypectomy. Histopathological examination revealed a laryngeal polyp of telangiectatic type characterized by hyperplastic epithelial covering with reactive atypia, prominent superficial acanthosis with neutrophils, and prominent chronic inflammation and thrombosed vessels in the stroma."
