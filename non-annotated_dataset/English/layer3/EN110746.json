  "text": "We describe a very uncommon case of meningoencephalitis due to Listeria monocytogenes in a 11-month-old immunocompetent girl. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture was positive on the second day. Antibiotic therapy was promptly started but the disease was complicated by neurological deterioration and decompensated hydrocephalus. The child required a very demanding pediatric and neurosurgical management and was discharged after 40 days without major sequelae."
