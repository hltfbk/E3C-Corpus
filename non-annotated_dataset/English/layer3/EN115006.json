  "text": "The present study described a 60-year-old Chinese male who presented with two aneurysms in the middle and lower segment of the right superficial femoral artery causing the symptoms of pain, coldness and numbness in the right lower limb. This case was diagnosed with syphilitic superficial femoral aneurysm because of positive syphilitic testing and the inflammatory cell infiltration around the adventitial vasa vasorum under the pathological examination. Anti-syphilis treatment, stent graft implantation and open surgery were attempted to eliminate the syphilis and aneurysm, which was ultimately successful, with no symptoms after a follow-up of 3 months."
