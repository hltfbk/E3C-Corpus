  "text": "We present two cases of female caucasian patients aged 40 and 63 years respectively admitted following severe stressful events who met the diagnostic criteria of tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy, namely acute chest pain, transient akinesis or dyskinesia of the left ventricle, new dynamic electrocardiogram changes and no significant epicardial coronary artery disease in the absence of recent head trauma, intracranial bleeding, phaeochromocytoma, myocarditis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Both had elevated cardiac biomarkers. Characteristically the condition is transient and the abnormal akinesia/dyskinesia of the left ventricle has been observed to normalise within 1-month as in our patients who made full recoveries."
