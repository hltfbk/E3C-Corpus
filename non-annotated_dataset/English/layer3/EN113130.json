  "text": "We presented an extremely rare case of a 33-year-old ThaiÂ woman with concomitant kappa light chain myeloma with adrenal Cushing syndrome, both of which were related to skeletal manifestations. A precedence report indicated that treatment of the Cushing syndrome could exacerbate the myeloma symptoms. Therefore, we were faced with the dilemma of which disease should be addressed first. We decided to treat our patient with a combination chemotherapy followed by an autologous stem cell transplant. Subsequently, a left laparoscopic adrenalectomy was successfully undertaken."
