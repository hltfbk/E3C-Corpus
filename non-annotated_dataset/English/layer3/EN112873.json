  "text": "We report a case of factitious hypoglycemia in a 19-year-old foster care adolescent female who presented to the Emergency Department with recurrent hypoglycemic episodes, to the degree that the patient required large amounts of dextrose and further management by intensive care unit hospitalization. Further inquiry revealed that the patient intentionally injected herself with large doses of insulin for the purposes of seeking hospital admission."
