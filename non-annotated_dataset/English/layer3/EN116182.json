  "text": "In March 2013, a 36-year-old female presented with right-sided perimandibular swelling, recurrent facial pain and exposed necrotic bone after previous extraction of tooth 47. She had the medical history of Crohn's disease for more than one decade with chronic active enterocolitis, fistula disease as well as previous oral manifestation and was currently treated with Adalimumab since September 2008. Due to steroid-induced osteoporosis, diagnosed in 2004, she received oral Bisphosphonates (Risedronate) from 2004 until 2007 followed by two infusions of Zoledronic acid in 2008 and 2009."
