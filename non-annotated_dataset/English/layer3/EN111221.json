  "text": "We report a patient with multiple glomus tumors on the time of diagnosis, which was histologically diagnosed as an atypical glomus tumor following resection of a tumor thrombus in the left renal vein, inferior vena cava trombus with intracardial extension, and mitral valve specimen. The intramuscular lesion from the thigh was diagnosed as a glomus tumor of uncertain malignant potential. Further examinations revealed multiple lesions trough her body: kidneys, breast, heart and subcutaneous tissue. The diagnosis of glomus tumor of uncertain malignant potential versus glomus tumor with low malignant potential could be quite challenging, and the clinical course may be as a determining factor for final diagnosis."
