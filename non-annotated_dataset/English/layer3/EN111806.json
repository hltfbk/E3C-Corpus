  "text": "A 56-year-old psychiatric patient who jumped from height had a polytrauma and a floating knee injury. Following the primary care and damage control surgery with knee-spanning fixator at some other centers, he was shifted to us on ventilator care and was directly admitted to intensive care unit for further management. On presentation, it was a floating knee injury with gross comminution of both femur and tibia with associated Hoffa with bent implant in situ. It was managed by plating of both lower end femur and tibia and at the end of 6 months, showed a satisfactory outcome."
