  "text": "A 51-year-old female with Sjogren's syndrome and recent history of varicella zoster infection presented with right upper and lower extremity weakness of one week duration. She was noted to have contrast enhancement at C2-C4 cord levels on cervico-thoracic MRI. Comprehensive work up was negative except for presence of a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and oligoclonal bands in the CSF. She was diagnosed with transverse myelitis secondary to varicella zoster infection and was treated with high dose steroids in addition to acyclovir with improvement in her symptoms. Two months later she developed left upper and lower extremity weakness, bilateral dysesthesias and urinary incontinence. Repeat MRI of the cervico-thoracic spine revealed worsening enhancement at lower cervical cord levels (C5-7) with extension to T1. CSF analysis was unchanged; however immunological work up was abnormal for elevated NMO-IgG/AQP4 antibody. She was diagnosed with NMOSD and was treated with immunosuppressive therapy. Initially with IV methylprednisone and Cyclophosphamide therapy followed by Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) maintenance therapy with good response. Repeat MRI 6Â months later showed near complete resolution of previous abnormal cord signal changes."
