  "text": "We describe a case of a patient with prostate adenocarcinoma, treated with dual ICPIs comprised of ipilimumab and nivolumab, who developed elevated liver enzymes in the context of infliximab therapy prescribed to treat gastrointestinal irAE from his ICPIs. The patient's grade 3 colitis became steroid-refractory, requiring a one-time infusion of infliximab, a biologic agent used commonly in inflammatory bowel disease, as a rescue therapy, to which he responded. The patient subsequently developed liver injury. This presented a diagnostic dilemma involving differential diagnoses of hepatotoxicity due to ICPI or infliximab exposure. A careful review of the clinical history, evaluation of the chronology of events, and exclusion of other causes of acute hepatitis were employed to make the final diagnosis of this event as infliximab-associated hepatotoxicity."
