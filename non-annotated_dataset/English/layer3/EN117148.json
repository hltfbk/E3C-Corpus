  "text": "A 45-year-old patient presented with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Liver metastases had been intra-operatively confirmed by histology. Prior to initiating treatment, a portacath was surgically implanted. Subsequently, the patient received a weekly dose of 1,000 mg/m(2) gemcitabine combined with 2,000 mg/m(2) high-dose 5-fluorouracil as a 24-hour infusion for palliative treatment. As the patient was suffering from a stenosis of the ductus hepaticus communis, an endoprosthesis was primarily implanted. After 18 applications of chemotherapy during which only low toxic side effects such as nausea, vomiting and alopecia (NCI-CTC grade 1) presented, a partial remission of the primary tumor was observed. In the course of chemotherapy treatment, the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 tumor marker value normalized. Thus, the interdisciplinary tumor board of the University of Erlangen decided to perform a laparoscopy to evaluate the status of liver metastases after palliative chemotherapy treatment. Subsequently, the primary tumor could be completely resected (pT2, pN0, pM0, L0, V0, G2, R0); liver metastases were not observed. Eight years after the initial diagnosis, the patient is relapse-free, professionally fully integrated and presents with an excellent performance status."
