  "text": "A 47-year-old white woman with unilateral pharyngeal discomfort presented to our ear, nose, and throat clinic. She had no risk factors for the development of a spontaneous retropharyngeal hematoma, for example, hypertension or coagulation disorder. As she was overweight, the anamnesis included signs of obstructive sleep apnea such as snoring or breathing arrests during the night, which she denied. An endoscopic examination showed a submucosal hemorrhage of the posterior wall of her pharynx. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a retropharyngeal hematoma without evidence of the injury of any blood vessel. A subsequent seven-channel polygraphy revealed a severe obstructive sleep apnea with an apnea-hypopnea index of 59.5 per hour. She was subsequently treated with auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure resolving obstructive sleep apnea immediately. Twoâ€‰months after this episode she presented without any complaints."
