  "text": "A 26-year-old female with Loeys-Dietz syndrome and congenital hydrocephalus treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, was evaluated after developing new-onset ascites of unclear etiology after abdominal surgery for repair of an aortic aneurysm requiring multiple therapeutic paracenteses. Her serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) was greater than 1.1, suggestive of a portal hypertensive etiology. Gram stain as well as multiple cultures of her ascites fluid were both negative. Extensive investigation including hepatic venous portal gradient measurement and liver biopsy revealed no evidence of hepatic disease or portal hypertension. She was ultimately found to have sterile cerebrospinal fluid ascites which was treated successfully with a peritoneovenous shunt."
