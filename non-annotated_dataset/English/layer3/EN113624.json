  "text": "A 32-year-old male sustained obturator dislocation with ipsilateral fracture neck femur following road traffic accident. After initial assessment and treatment, definitive treatment was carried out. Hip was approached through Watson-Jones approach. The head and neck was found to be dislocated and lying close to obturator foramen. A button hole through the anterior capsule and medium-sized chondral defect of the femoral head articular surface was noted. An uncemented total hip arthroplasty was performed. Post-operative period was uneventful and the patient was mobilized weight-bearing as tolerated with walker. He was discharged on the 5th post-operative day. He regained pain-free good range of motion over a period of 6 weeks."
