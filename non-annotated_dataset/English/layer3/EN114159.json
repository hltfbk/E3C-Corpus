  "text": "The patient in case 1 had micrognathia and cleft palate, and his tongue protruded into the nasal cavity via a cleft palate. His invaginated tongue was considered an extreme type of glossoptosis and he was diagnosed as Pierre Robin sequence. The patient in case 2 also had micrognathia and cleft palate same as case 1 and accompanied some anomalad. Her chromosome analysis confirmed a diagnosis of 1p36 deletion syndrome and she diagnosed as 1p36 deletion syndrome complicated with Pierre Robin sequence. In both cases, tongue protruded into the nasal cavity via a cleft palate occupied pharynx and nasal cavity, resulting in severe dyspnea. Only the backside of the tongue was visible by laryngoscopy and oropharyngeal intubation was impossible. Therefore, fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation was done to secure the airway for resuscitation."
