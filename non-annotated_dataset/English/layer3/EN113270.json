  "text": "We report a case of the left medial malleolus stress fracture secondary to advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA) with severe varus deformities. Mechanical malalignment like severe genu varus deformity is a risk factor for a stress fracture in knee OA. A single-staged management by the surgical treatment of stress fracture, along with the correction of underlying knee deformity by bilateral simultaneous total knee arthroplasty of this case is discussed. We also describe the pathomechanics involved in this injury in the present case report."
