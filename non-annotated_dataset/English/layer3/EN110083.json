  "text": "A ten year old female has been allowed in hospitalization for intense frontal headaches. Theses headaches were associated to a progressive loss of the vision and to tonic seizure of the lowers members. These clinical signs had evolved for four (4) months.\nThe neurological examination was normal. The examination of the other devices was also normal and there was no fever. Computed tomography scan (CT Scan) revealed a nodular formation (19 mm high on 16.7 mm wide) in the anterior part of the third ventricle with an obstructive hydrocephalus.\nThis lesion was enhanced by the contrast administration. The likely diagnosis of intraventricular tumor (colloid cyst) was evoked. A total removal has been performed using a subchoroidal approach. The patient left the hospital 8 days after surgery. Histological examination revealed the presence of central necrosis surrounded by a tuberculous like granuloma. A new clinical status of the patient did not show tuberculosis infection stigma, HIV serology was negative. The Tuberculin skin test and the lung radiography were also normal.\nThe confirmation of the tuberculous etiology was obtained by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The CSF examination showed only 3 cells (3 lymphocytes) and the bacteriological examination using the ziehl-nielsen staining was negative. Protein level in CSF was normal (0.4g/l). She was treated with antituberculous chemotherapy including Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamid and Ethambutol for six months.\nThe patient is living normally and is following her secondary studies, six (6) years afterwards."
