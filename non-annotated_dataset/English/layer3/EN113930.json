  "text": "Herein, we report three cases of esophageal cancer with ARSA and NRILN which underwent successful VATS-E. Case 1, a 53-year-old male who had early stage esophageal cancer was performed VATS-E. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) series showed \"Bayonet sign\" (T1aN0M0, pStageIA in UICC). Case 2, a 75-year-old male who had advanced esophageal cancer was performed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and following VATS-E. This case had right thoracic duct and \"Bayonet sign\" on upper GI series (T1bN2M0, pStage IIIA in UICC). Case3, a 72-year-old male who had advanced esophageal cancer was performed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and following VATS-E (T3N2M0, pStageIIIB in UICC). All of these three cases were performed VATS-E and discharged without any complication."
