  "text": "We describe the clinical and investigative findings in two families with a PRKAG2 mutation from the different variants in the gene on chromosome 7q36.1, emphasising that the variability of phenotypes and that presentation in childhood is common. Furthermore, we highlight that skeletal myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are significant debilitating characteristics of the PRKAG2 mutation."
