  "text": "We present the case of a 56-year-old man who developed multiple mycotic aneurysms of the right hepatic artery and massive splenic infarction as rare complications of Streptococcus agalactiae infective endocarditis. The patient underwent urgent right hepatic artery ligation and splenectomy. The postoperative course was complicated by an episode of hemobilia due to the rupture of a partially thrombosed mycotic aneurysm into the biliary tree. Thus, selective radiological embolization of the left hepatic artery branches was necessary."
