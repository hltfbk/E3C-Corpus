  "text": "Newborn female on the first day of extra uterine life referred in March 8th, 2013 from the maternity of Sylvanus Olympio Teaching Hospital to surgical emergencies of the same hospital for intraoral tumor. It was after a full-term pregnancy (37 weeks of amenorrhea), during which, no related-pregnancy pathology nor unrelated ones was discovered. There was no concept of taking foetal toxic drug by the mother. Obstetric ultrasonography at the 12th week of gestation had objectified no malformations. The delivery was done vaginally without incident in March 8, 2013 with an Apgar score of 10-10-10 and a weight of 3050 grams.\nExamination of the newborn at her admission noted an intraoral tumor pink, firm, pedunculated sitting in the gingival surface of upper left of the midline cleft maxilla. The tumor measured 6 centimeters long axis and obstructed the entire oral cavity, thus preventing the taking of the womb and feed. The rest of the intraoral mucosa was normal. The newborn showed no respiratory disorder. There were no other clinically visible malformations. A peripheral vein was taken for an infusion of hypertonic glucose solution 10% to fight against possible hypoglycaemia. Surgical treatment was performed and consisted of tumor resection under general anesthesia. Figure 3 shows the immediate postoperative appearance. Histologically, the tumor was formed by a proliferation of tumor large, round or fusiform with abundant cytoplasm, and eosinophilic granular cells with a round nucleus. On the surface, the tumor was covered by squamous epithelium regular kind. Figure 4 shows the appearance of the tumor after its removal. Control of the child two weeks after surgery showed a healthy intraoral mucosa without tumor recurrence."
