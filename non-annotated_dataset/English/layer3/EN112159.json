  "text": "We presented a case of a 54-year-old woman with a mass in the deep lobe of the right parotid gland involving the ipsilateral skull base and mastoid. The patient exhibited gradual right facial swelling but no other obvious symptoms. Combined resection of the total right parotid gland and partial skull base excision were performed. The biopsy conducted before the surgery and sections cut from intraoperatively obtained tissues were not definitive for identifying the character of the neoplasm. A final diagnosis of tubular BCA without malignant elements was established based on postoperative pathology results and immunohistochemical analysis. The tumour did not recur during the 12-mo follow-up period."
