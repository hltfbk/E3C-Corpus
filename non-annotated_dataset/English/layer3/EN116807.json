  "text": "A 33-year-old woman from the outskirts of Danzhou city, Hainan province, China, had an 11-month history of chronic diarrhea with abdominal pain, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and severe weight loss. The patient was misdiagnosed at an outpatient clinic and one hospital. She was finally correctly diagnosed with C. philippinensis by stool examination. The patient was given a 30-days course of albendazole (400 mg/day) and had an uneventful and stable recovery."
