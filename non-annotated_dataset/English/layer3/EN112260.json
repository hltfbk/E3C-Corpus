  "text": "The patient complained of dyspnea and upper abdominal pain for a week in August 2017. He was diagnosed with anaplastic lymphoma kinase-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma combined with multiple distant metastases. Crizotinib was initiated as a first-line treatment at a dosage of 250 mg twice daily. No adverse effects were seen until day 46. On day 55, he was admitted to the hospital with elevated liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (402 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (215 IU/L) and total bilirubin (145 μmol/L) and was diagnosed with crizotinib-induced fulminant liver failure. Despite crizotinib discontinuation and intensive supportive therapy, the level of AST (1075 IU/L), ALT (240 IU/L) and total bilirubin (233 μmol/L) continued to rapidly increase, and he died on day 60."
