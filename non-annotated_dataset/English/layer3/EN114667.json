  "text": "We present a case of 18 year female, who came with a swelling in right groin since 2 years which was diagnosed to be osteochondroma on x-ray and magnetic resonance imaging. Excision biopsy was done as the patient wanted it to be removed for cosmetic purpose and confirmed it to be non-malignant osteochondroma. There has been no recurrence even after 1 year of follow up."
