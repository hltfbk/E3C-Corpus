  "text": "A 59-year-old man presented with blurred vision in his right eye. Venous congestion of the epiescleral and retinal vessels were observed. EDI-OCT disclosed macular subretinal fluid with an increase of choroidal thickness up to 341 μm. Brain and orbital computerized tomography showed an enlarged right superior ophthalmic vein. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging and angiography disclosed a decrease in blood flow, an indirect sign of carotid cavernous fistula. After a 3 months follow-up, spontaneous closure of the fistula occurred. Both the dilation of the conjunctiva and retinal veins improved. EDI-OCT showed resolution of the subfoveal fluid and a reduction of the subfoveal choroidal thickness to 271 μm after a 3 months follow-up and 168 μm after a 8 months follow-up."
