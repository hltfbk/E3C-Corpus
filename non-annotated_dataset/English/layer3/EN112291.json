  "text": "A 69-year-old woman presented with acute onset of blurred vision 2 weeks following Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy for posterior subcapsular opacification. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 1/120, and bio-microscopy revealed a central full-thickness corneal laceration. Conservative treatment consisted of topical ocular antibiotics, cycloplegics, hypotensive drops and a soft therapeutic contact lens. Her final visual acuity improved to 6/18 with resolution of the corneal laceration."
