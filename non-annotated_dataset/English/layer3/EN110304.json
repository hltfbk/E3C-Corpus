  "text": "In January 2016, a 48-year-old man presented with a 02-day history of pain and progressive spontaneous swelling of the left thigh. He had progressive limitation of the homolateral knee. He was receiving oral anticoagulation therapy for cerebral vascular accident since 2013 and valvular replacement since 2014. There was no visible haematoma in the lower limb.\nNeurological examination showed a complete functional deficit of all muscles dependent on the right lumbar plexus (femoral and obturator nerves), with hypoesthesia and abolition of the ipsilateral knee reflex. Computed tomography of the pelvis showed a massive haematoma, (7x4 cm) of the psoas and the iliac muscle. Blood tests showed hypocoagulation (Quick value 9%; PTT: 159/29; INR: 9,27) and anaemia (Hb: 9,4 g/dL; Ht: 29,6%). A fresh frozen plasma was transfused because the PPSB wasnâ€™t available. Anticoagulation was discontinued and the patient takes 10 mg of phytomenadione. Haemoglobin levels remained stable for 4 days, thereby excluding active bleeding. However, complete recovery functional deficit of the lumbar plexus musculature were obtained after 4 weeks. Considering the blood condition of the patient and the manifested neurological injury, drainage of the haematoma was rejected, because of the increased risk of bleeding complications and mortality. Conservative management was continued. Electromyographs showed complete recovery and no signs of denervation or other axonal lesion. At the three-month follow-up, the patient was entirely asymptomatic."
