  "text": "We present the case of a 48-year-old German Caucasian woman presenting with hearing loss on the left side and vertigo. She had undergone three previous stapedectomies for hearing improvement. Reformatted high-resolution computed tomographic scanning and the patient's history confirmed the diagnosis of concurrent canal dehiscence syndrome."
