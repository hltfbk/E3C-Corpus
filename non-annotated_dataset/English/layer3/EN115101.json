  "text": "A 58-year-old man had been suffering from general fatigue and severe anemia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any significant bleeding. Abdominal computer tomography revealed a hypervascular tumor in the small intestine. Oral double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) detected a polypoid lesion (2 cm in diameter) in the jejunum. We performed laparoscopic-assisted partial resection of the jejunum. The histological features of the tumor were consistent with PG. The patient's anemia gradually improved without the need for oral iron after surgery."
