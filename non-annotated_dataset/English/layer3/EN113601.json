  "text": "We present a case of a 56-year-old man in whom a pancreatic mass was found incidentally. The lesion was determined to be a pancreatic plasmacytoma after distal pancreatectomy. There are no indications of clinical, laboratory or imaging findings of multiple myeloma nor any association with plasmacytoma in any other places, so the diagnosis of primary pancreatic plasmacytoma was made."
