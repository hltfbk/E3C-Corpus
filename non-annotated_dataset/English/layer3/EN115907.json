  "text": "We report the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian male with deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-defined low-risk MDS who was treated with lenalidomide, achieving complete cytogenetic remission and erythroid response. After tapering off and interrupting the treatment, the patient relapsed and showed a new response by lenalidomide retreatment. Six years after the initial treatment, we registered a durable erythroid long-term response and good tolerance, but there was no evidence of a very profound cytogenetic response compared to using lenalidomide as a first-line treatment. Cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization together with hemoglobin level, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and vitamin B12 level helped us to monitor the patient response; during the various phases of lenalidomide treatment, MCV and vitamin B12 normalization correlated with good response."
