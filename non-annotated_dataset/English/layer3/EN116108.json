  "text": "We here report a case of a 56-year-old Japanese woman with non-small-cell lung carcinoma with a secondary T790M mutation associated with resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that maintained sensitivity of brain metastases to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. An autopsy showed that the primary focus had a T790M mutation; however, no mutations of T790M were found in the brain metastases."
