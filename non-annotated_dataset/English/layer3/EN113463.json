  "text": "A 68-year-old woman with low back pain experienced a sudden onset of bilateral lower limb weakness, it was followed 14 days later by urine retention. At consultation, magnetic resonance imaging and identification of serum β-hemolytic streptococci provided a diagnosis of Streptococcus agalactiae infection. She was started on antibiotics. Despite diminishing signs of inflammation, preoperative MRI showed an epidural mass at T12-L4 compressing the cord and involving the paravertebral muscles as well. Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in both urine and blood. Because of bilateral lower limb weakness and urine retention, T12-L4 hemilaminectomy was performed. The L3/L4 intertransverse ligament resected and abscess drained. Histopathology revealed that inflammatory cells had invaded the facet joint. Group B beta-hemolytic streptococci were identified, confirming the diagnosis. The patient continued with the antibiotics postoperatively, and her health rapidly improved."
