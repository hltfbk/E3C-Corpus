  "text": "Here, we report the case of a 31-year-old Caucasian multiparous female (gravida 3, para 1) who had a sudden onset of abdominal pain at 28 weeks of gestation. The patient had no history of caesarean section. Exploratory laparotomy was performed due to deterioration of the patient's clinical condition, and ultrasound results were suspicious for hemoperitoneum. Uterine rupture in the posterior wall with active bleeding from the defect was confirmed. A caesarean section was performed, and a live female infant weighing 1000 g, with an Apgar score of three, was delivered. A hysterectomy was performed during the caesarean section."
