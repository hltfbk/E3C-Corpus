  "text": "The first case was a 41-year-old woman with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma metastasizing to the cervix. Immunohistochemistry of the cervical biopsy specimen revealed thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1(+), cytokeratin (CK)-7(+), and (CK)-20(-). Gene mutational analysis showed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) L858R mutation in exon 21. She had a positive response to gefitinib, for both the pulmonary mass and cervical neoplasm. The second case was a 29-year-old woman who was diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation. After 12 mo of treatment with icotinib, ovarian biopsy showed adenocarcinoma with CDX2(-), TTF-1(+++), PAX8(-), CK-7(+++), CK-20(++), and Ki67(15%+), accompanied with EGFR 19-del mutation and T790M mutation."
