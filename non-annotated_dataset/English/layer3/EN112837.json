  "text": "An 80-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for sudden onset of severe abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a large left internal iliac aneurysm (6.5 cm in diameter) and a ureteric rupture with leakage of contrast media from the left ureter, indicating a spontaneous ureteral rupture. The patient was treated with placement of a ureteral double-J stent under endoscopic and X-ray fluoroscopic guidance and endovascular aortic repair. His postoperative course was uneventful and he was discharged on postoperative day 20. A computed tomography scan at 2 weeks after surgery showed no contrast extravasation from the ureter or end leak."
