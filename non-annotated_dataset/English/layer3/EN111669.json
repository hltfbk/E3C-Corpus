  "text": "A 54-year-old male was admitted to the department of gastroenterology for abdominal pain. He presented with lower abdominal pain, diarrhea and recurrent oral and penile ulcers. He was misdiagnosed with Behcet's disease and treated with prednisone. But after one month, he was hospitalized in another hospital for reexamination. This time, the lesion on the penis was biopsied for histological examination. The final pathological diagnosis was ALCL, ALK-negative. The patient was treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone chemotherapy. However, he died within one month."
