  "text": "A 43-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department (ED) in cardiac arrest. Swelling of his right lower limb was noted on arrival. Point of care ultrasound was performed during ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and showed a thrombus in the right iliofemoral vein as well as dilatation of the right ventricle. Fibrinolytic therapy was initiated immediately and a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved 30 minutes later. The diagnosis of PE was finally confirmed on computed tomography pulmonary angiography once haemodynamic stability was achieved. The patient was thereafter transferred to the intensive care unit for postresuscitation care and further management. Several days later, he was discharged home neurologically intact and fully recovered."
