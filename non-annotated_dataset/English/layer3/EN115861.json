  "text": "We present the case of 13 year old female with three years history of spontaneous, progressively increasing, painful swellings along right middle finger and right heel. She was otherwise well and had normal serum calcium but elevated phosphate levels. Plain radiography demonstrated a dense lobulated cluster of calcific nodules within soft tissues consistent with a diagnosis of tumoral calcinosis. This diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of histopathological examination following surgical excision."
