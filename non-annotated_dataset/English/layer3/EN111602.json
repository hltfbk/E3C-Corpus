  "text": "Case 1 was a 66-month-old girl with lesions on the abdominal wall; tumor size was about 3.4 cm × 6.1 cm × 2 cm. The patient underwent radical resection of the tumor. After the operation, an alternating vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide and etoposide (IE) regimen was given for eight cycles, and the patient survived for 66 mo without progression. Case 2 was a 40-month-old girl, with a vulvar lesion; tumor size was about 3.3 cm × 5 cm × 2.5 cm. The tumor was partially resected by surgery. The family left treatment after two cycles of vincristine, pirarubicin, and cyclophosphamide/IE chemotherapy, and the patient died at home six months after surgery."
