  "text": "We present here a 34-year-old female who came to us with back pain, episodic hypertension associated with palpitations, and sweating. Back pain was not associated with other neurological symptoms and neuroclaudication. She was treated with en bloc resection of the tumor with L1 corpectomy posterior instrumentation and anterior reconstruction."
