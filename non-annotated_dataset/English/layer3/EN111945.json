  "text": "We report the case of a 63-year old immunocompetent man who underwent total arch replacement following infection by the nontuberculous mycobacteria M. avium. The procedure involved total aneurysmal resection and arch replacement with a rifampicin-bonded gelatin-sealed woven Dacron graft. He was discharged without complications and remained asymptomatic after 30â€‰months."
