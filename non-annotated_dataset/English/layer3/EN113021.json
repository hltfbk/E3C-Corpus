  "text": "A patient with known Open Angle Glaucoma and Atrial Fibrillation on warfarin presents symptoms and signs suggestive acute angle closure. Examination reveals the underlying cause is a large, macula involving, spontaneous suprachoroidal haemorrhage secondary to loss of anti-coagulation control. Following aggressive medical treatment and surgical intervention, including drainage combined cataract extraction with intraocular lens implant, pars-plana vitrectomy, and external drainage of suprachoroidal haematoma, we managed to preserve the patient's eye and some of its function."
