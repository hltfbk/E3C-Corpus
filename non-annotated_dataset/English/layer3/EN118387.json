  "text": "We present a case of 43-year-old African American female who presented with left leg and left wrist pain. The initial radiographs revealed well-defined radiolucent lesions in multiple bones involving the left wrist and the left lower limb. The magnetic resonance demonstrated multiple lesions, which showed high signal on the T1 and low signal on the fat suppressed T2 images. This favored the diagnosis of intraosseous lipomatosis that was confirmed by biopsy."
