  "text": "This paper describes a case of a liver recipient presenting with a newly formed renal mass a year after liver transplantation. The patient underwent liver transplantation due to alcoholic liver cirrhosis, with preoperative corticosteroid therapy and postoperative immunosuppressants (tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil). His 1-year follow-up was uneventful, with a satisfying graft function and lack of any symptoms. During a routine follow-up abdominal ultrasound, he was diagnosed with a renal tumor. The renal imaging findings were inconclusive (with a differential diagnosis to renal cell carcinoma), while the computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed scar tissue in the lungs suggestive of previous inflammation. The patient underwent radical nephrectomy, with histopathological analysis showing renal aspergilloma, yielding postoperative treatment with voriconazole. His follow up was uneventful, and the chest CT did not show any change in pulmonary lesions. This case illustrates the possibility of aspergillosis affecting the lungs of liver recipients, subsequently affecting the kidney and forming an aspergilloma."
