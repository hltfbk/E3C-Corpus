  "text": "After a personalized design employing a tissue engineering strategy, we reconstructed the sellar floor in a 65-year-old woman who had undergone EETS for a pituitary adenoma with progressive bilateral visual loss. To repair the bony defect of the sellar floor, we used a novel bilaminar chitosan scaffold. The patient had an unremarkable postoperative course with no evidence of CSF leak. The polymer was well tolerated without toxicity, infection or complications. After 2 years of follow up the patient remains neurologically intact, and in good endocrinological status."
