  "text": "A 16-year-old girl of Hispanic origin sustained a sudden dislocation of the patella while she was dancing. Pre-operative computed tomography revealed a patellar dislocation with rotation around the vertical axis with the patella wedged on the side of the lateral condyle. Closed reduction failed. Open reduction was needed and the torn structures were repaired. At 1-year follow-up, she had a good functional outcome and reported no recurrence of dislocation."
