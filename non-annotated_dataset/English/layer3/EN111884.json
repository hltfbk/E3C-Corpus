  "text": "A 63-year-old male patient had a tumor in the right posterior mediastinum, and was eventually diagnosed with PSC and gingival metastasis. The patient underwent thoracoscopic right upper pneumonectomy with lymph node dissections, and the subsequent gingival biopsy revealed a metastatic PSC. The immunohistochemistry revealed that both PSC site tissues were positive for vimentin, CKAE1/AE3 and Ki-67. The patient received radiotherapy and chemotherapy after surgery, and deceased two months later due to systemic tumor metastases."
