  "text": "In West Nusa Tenggara Regional Hospital, the authors found two cases of subcutaneous hemangioma in patients of very different ages. The first patient was a 2-year-old Sasak girl, and the other was a 40-year-old Sasak man. The pediatric patient was treated with an elliptical approach, whereas the adult patient was treated with lateral rhinotomy extended by an elliptical approach to remove the hemangioma and ligate the feeding arteries. After surgery, the adult patient was followed up for 5 months, whereas the pediatric patient was followed up for 3 months. The results for both patients were good, with minimal scar formation."
