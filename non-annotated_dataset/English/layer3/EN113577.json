  "text": "A 32-year old autosplenectomized Nigerian male with severe sickle cell disease was referred to the National Institutes of Health for allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Despite testing negative for malaria by both smear and PCR 2 weeks after arrival in the USA, the patient developed fever and diffuse bilateral lower rib cage and upper abdominal pain 2 weeks later and subsequently tested positive for Plasmodium falciparum. Parasitaemia was tracked over time by microscopy and nucleic acid tests to evaluate the therapeutic response in the setting of hyposplenism. The patient showed prompt resolution of patent infection by microscopy but remained positive by molecular methods for > 30 days after treatment initiation."
