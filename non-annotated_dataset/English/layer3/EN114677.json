  "text": "We report a case of 18 year old male presenting with acute onset severe pain in right gluteal region and associated swelling with no history of trauma. All possible investigations including haematological work up, Radiographs, Ultrasonography, aspiration and Magnetic resonance imaging proved to be inconclusive. Open excision and histopathology revealed the condition as myositis ossificans."
