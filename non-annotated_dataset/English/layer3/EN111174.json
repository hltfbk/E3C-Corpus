  "text": "The patient was a 56-year-old Chinese male who exhibited six synchronous invasive adenocarcinomas at diagnosis [T2(6)N0M0], and who achieved durable clinical benefit under adjuvant chemotherapy for 41â€‰months following wedge resection and lobectomy. Whole-exome sequencing revealed that two lesions (L4 and L6) in the left upper lobe of the patient's lung shared 28 nonsynonymous mutations; thus, suggesting that the lesions may have arisen from a common ancestor at the early stages of tumorigenesis, and spread into distinct histologic subtypes. Moreover, while L5 was in the same lobe as L4 and L6, it represented a distinct lineage as it did not share any mutations with other lesions. Notably, the BRAF V600E oncogenic mutation was exclusive to L5. In addition, the KRAS G12C mutation was identified in three lesions (L1-L3) located in the right lung, which may have resulted from convergent evolution."
