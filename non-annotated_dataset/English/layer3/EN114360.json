  "text": "Ulcerations and hemorrhages involving the tongue were noted secondary to TMP-SMZ desensitization against PCP in a 46-year-old male who had previously been diagnosed with IgA nephropathy and sustained prolonged corticosteroid therapy. There was an urgent need for an alternative regimen due to the severe response to TMP-SMZ. The patient was successfully treated with a combination therapy of caspofungin and clindamycin."
