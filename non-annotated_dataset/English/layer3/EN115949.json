  "text": "We report the case of a 74-year-old Italian woman who presented with a complaint of dizziness. Her dizziness was found to be a result of aneurysmal dilatation arising from the distal segment of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery. A mid-line suboccipital craniotomy was performed, and the aneurysm was clipped without post-operative deficits and with improvement in the patient's dizziness. In our present report, we also review the literature and discuss our case with regard to the clinical and radiological features and surgical procedure performed."
