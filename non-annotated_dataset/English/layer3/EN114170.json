  "text": "We presented patient who developed MPO-ANCA-associated MPA with lung and musculoskeletal involvement after 4 years on regular HD due to bilateral nephrectomy. After excluding the other causes of MPO-ANCA positivity, diagnosis was confirmed even without renal biopsy. Patient received standard immunosuppression therapy and he is still in remission after 27 months."
