  "text": "The authors report the excision of an osteoid osteoma lying at the distal condyle of a metacarpal bone of the left hand. The clinical and radiological findings are exposed as well as the surgical management of the lesion. Pain and swelling disappeared after surgery, and there was no evidence of recurrence at follow-up."
