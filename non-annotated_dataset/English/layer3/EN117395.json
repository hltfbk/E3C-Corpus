  "text": "We present the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian man with axial torsion of a Meckel's diverticulum around its base, a rare complication. He presented with acute, severe abdominal pain, and a clinical diagnosis of perforated acute appendicitis was made. Laparotomy revealed a torted Meckel's diverticulum with distal necrosis and perforation, which was resected. His recovery was uncomplicated, and he was discharged to home six days post-operatively."
