  "text": "A 58-year-old man presented with right facial pain, mostly localized in the right zygomatic zone, alveolar region, and jaws. Similar to acupuncture and shock pain, the pain lasted about five seconds after each attack before resolving unaided. A diagnosis of TN was made, after which treatment with acupuncture therapy and oral carbamazepine was given. However, the pain was not satisfactorily controlled. Subsequently, gasserian ganglion NC of the right trigeminal nerve guided by computed tomography (CT) was performed on the patient. Following this procedure, the right zygomatic, alveolar, submandibular, and cheek pain disappeared completely. The right zygomatic and alveolar areas experienced mild numbness (level II). At 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-mo follow-ups after surgery, the patient was painless and the numbness score was level I."
