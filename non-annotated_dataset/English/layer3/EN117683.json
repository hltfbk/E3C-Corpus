  "text": "A middle-aged woman suffering from PBC for 17 years got admitted with clinical and biochemical features of cholestatic syndrome. A provisional diagnosis of worsening PBC was proved wrong by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, which revealed typical benign stricture and dilatation of common bile duct with typical beading appearance suggestive of PSC. The patient was stented and treated with an increased dose of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) which improved the symptoms and the biochemical picture."
