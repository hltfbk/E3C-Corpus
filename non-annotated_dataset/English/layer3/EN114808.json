  "text": "A 26-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department following a road traffic accident. His initial evaluation revealed a radio-cubital displaced fracture at the elbow level with severe tenderness over the sternum. Chest X-ray on admission did not reveal any abnormality. On preoperative checkup he was found to have altered chest mechanics with severe pain and tenderness over the sternum. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed respiratory acidosis. Pulmonary electrical impedance tomography showed hypoventilation of anterior portions of both lungs. An ultrasound examination of the sternum showed a fractured sternum with complete disjunction. An ultrasound-guided bilateral parasternal block was performed which resulted in efficient analgesia and thereby improved his ventilation as indicated by the improvement in ABG."
