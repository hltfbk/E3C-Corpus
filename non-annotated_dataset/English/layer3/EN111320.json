  "text": "A 60-year-old woman underwent subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy for cancer of the pancreatic head. A follow-up computed tomography revealed a low-density tumor of the remnant pancreas. The pathological diagnosis was adenocarcinoma on endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration. Total resection of the remnant pancreas was performed for the tumor 3â€‰years after the initial surgery. We ligated the splenic vein at the point of distal side of the left gastric vein confluent. Immediately, the vein congestion around the stomach was confirmed. We found the stenosis of the confluent between the left gastric vein and splenic vein. We subsequently anastomosed the left gastric vein and splenic vein, following which the gastric venous congestion was relieved."
