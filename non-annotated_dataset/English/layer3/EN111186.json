  "text": "A 62-year-old woman who had undergone a total thyroidectomy for a papillary thyroid carcinoma 6 years prior presented with an enlarging pulmonary nodule. The nodule had decreased in size from 7.0 to 5.5 mm after adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy and enlarged to 8.7 mm over the next 5 years. Under a clinical diagnosis of a metastatic lung tumor, she underwent a thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection and was pathologically diagnosed with a PPM."
