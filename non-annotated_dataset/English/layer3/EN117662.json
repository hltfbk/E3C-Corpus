  "text": "A 37-year-old African woman with HIV infection diagnosed at 13 years of age was admitted to the emergency department after experiencing backache, severe headache, acute aphasia and psychomotor slowing for one week. Nine weeks earlier, highly active antiretroviral therapy in this patient had been changed because of loss of efficacy, and a rapid increase in CD4+ cell count and decrease of HIV viral load were observed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed extensive white matter lesions, and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid revealed an immunoreactive syndrome. Intensive investigations detected no opportunistic infections. A salvage therapy, including osmotherapy, corticosteroids and treatment of epileptic seizures, was performed, but the patient died from brainstem herniation 48 hours after admission. Neuropathologic examination of the brain revealed diffuse swelling, leptomeningeal infiltration by CD8 cells and enhancement of perivascular spaces by CD8+ cells."
