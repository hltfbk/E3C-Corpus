  "text": "An 18-year-old man with no significant medical or psychiatric history presented to our emergency room with a painful swollen penis and scrotum. He had used a steel penoscrotal ring to improve sexual pleasure 24 hours before. The clinical examination found a steel ring (7.5cm in diameter, 2.4cm wide and 1.4cm thick) at the base of his penis and scrotum, with important penoscrotal edema and erythema over the strangulated area. Other physical examinations were normal. Laboratory results on admission were in normal range. Initial attempts to remove the ring with lubrication with Cathejell failed because of the distal edema with massive penile enlargement. Attempts to cut the ring with the help of a dental micromotor were also unsuccessfully due to the thickness and rigidity of the ring. The decision was then made to use an angle grinder (Heinner VPU007, 600 W, 12000 RPM, 115mm) to divide the steel ring, but due to its thickness, we were unable to remove it. The ring was successfully removed after cutting it on the other side with the same angle grinder. A wooden tongue depressor was inserted between the penis and the ring and cooling with a saline solution was performed. The operating time was about 18 minutes and no iatrogenic damage was noted. The outcome of the patient was uneventful, with edema resolution over the next two days."
