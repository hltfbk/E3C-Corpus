  "text": "The current report presents two cases of HLH. Case 1, three-months-old boy born to second degree consanguineous parents was clinically suspected with HLH. A pathogenic variant in exon 2 of PRF1 gene [c.386G > C (p.Trp129Ser); FLH-type2] was detected. The parents and the fetus under investigation were shown to be heterozygous carriers, while Case-1 was homozygous for the said variant. Case 2, a one and half-year old male child referred for work-up was born to non-consanguineous young parents. His HLH suspicion was in accordance with HLH-2004 Revised diagnostic guidelines (fulfilling 5/8 criteria). Molecular study revealed hemizygous likely pathogenic variant c.138-3C > G in intron 1 of SH2D1A gene. Both the mother and younger sister were confirmed to be the carrier of the same variant."
