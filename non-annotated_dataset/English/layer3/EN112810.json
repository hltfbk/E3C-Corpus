  "text": "Two patients displayed acute-onset limb weakness, areflexia, and length-dependent sensory disturbances, which clinically indicate the diagnosis of GBS, but electrophysiological and cerebrospinal fluid results threw doubtful points to the initial diagnosis. The muscle biopsy showed lipid storage disorder; and compound heterozygous mutations in the electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH) gene were found in the two patients through targeted next generation sequencing, which provided the definite diagnostic evidences of late-onset MADD. Muscle weakness was quickly improved by riboflavin supplementation, but sensory disturbances required a long-term treatment."
