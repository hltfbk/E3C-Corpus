  "text": "A 67-year-old Caucasian woman presented with new dysphagia and had findings of esophageal Crohn's disease on endoscopy. The dosage of her current biologic therapy-adalimumab-was increased in frequency, without improvement. Our patient was started on tofacitinib and demonstrated an improvement in symptoms, with a repeat endoscopy showing resolution of the previous lesions."
