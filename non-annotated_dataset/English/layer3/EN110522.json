  "text": "A previously healthy 17-year-old male with noncontributory past medical history, presented with a one month of dry cough and intermittent hemoptysis. For several weeks prior to hospitalization, he experienced severe exertion dyspnea that limited his mobility. The patient also complained of high fever and shivers in 15 days. The patient acknowledged oral and genital aphtous ulcers occasionally in the past two years. On clinical examination, the patient was alert, oriented, and appeared weak and thin. He weighed 45 kilograms of unintentional weight loss over the preceding two months. The patient vital signs were as follows: temperature 39; blood pressure 128/70 mmHg; heart rate 117 bpm; respiratory rate 20 bpm and an oxygen saturation 97% on room air. He had folliculitis in his face otherwise; the rest of the examination was unremarkable (no oral lesions or penile ulcers objected). The patient's white blood count was 10.14 103 cells/ml with normal differential; red cell count was 9.18 GM/dL; hematocrit, 38.5% and platelets were 212 103 cells/ml. C-reactive protein was 105 mg.L-1.The liver function tests, urea and electrolytes were normal. His chest radiography showed right basal consolidation. The three acid-fast bacillus smears were negative, culture was underway. An initial chest CT found condensation in the apical segment of the inferior right lobe. The patient was placed under antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, but the evolution was marked by the non-clinical improvement and persistence of hemoptysis. Taking into consideration, the young age of the patient, the history of oral and genital aphthous stomatitis, and the recurrent hemoptysis, a chest CT angiography was requested. It showed a pulmonary embolism of the right pulmonary artery and the right lower lobe bronchus, the presence of a bilateral partial thrombosis ectasia of the right middle lobe bronchus and the left lower lobe brochus and a right intraventricular thrombus. The transthoracic echocardiography showed severe right ventricle enlargement and a 40 mm 26 mm friable mass with a broad attachment to the right ventricular outflow tract and distal right ventricle. The pathergy test was negative. He was finally diagnosed as Beh√ßet's disease (BD) associated with extensive venous thromboembolism including intracardiac thrombus in the right ventricle and pulmonary embolism. The patient was initially treated by anticoagulant then immunosuppressant: methylprednisolone bolus, cyclophosphamide and colchicine. The clinical evolution was favorable."
