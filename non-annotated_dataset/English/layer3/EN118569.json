  "text": "We present three Turkish patients with bronchobiliary fistula secondary to previous hepatic surgery due to hydatid cyst in two, a 19-year-old and a 47-year-old man, and iatrogenic trauma of the common bile duct by endoscopy in a 35-year-old man. All of the patients were successfully treated by minimally invasive methods including percutaneous drainage and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography."
