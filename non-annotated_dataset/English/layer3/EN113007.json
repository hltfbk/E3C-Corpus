  "text": "A 65-year-old female presents to clinic with 1-week acute upper respiratory tract infection. Her chest CT scan revealed a 25-29Â mm, round-like, heterogeneous lobulated solitary pulmonary nodule in the right lower lobe. Based on the microscopic features and a wide range of immunohistochemical examinations including vimentine, progesterone receptor (PR), CD34 and S100, the mass was diagnosed as PPM after surgery."
