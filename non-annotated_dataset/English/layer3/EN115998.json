  "text": "A young woman with a recurrent, right ovarian teratoma had previously undergone surgical removal 2 times. After the second surgery, she underwent regular out-patient follow-up, and no residual tumor was observed. However, 3Â years after the second surgery, she developed recurrent, bilateral ovarian teratomas, in conjunction with elevated carbohydrate antigen-125 levels."
