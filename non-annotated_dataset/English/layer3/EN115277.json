  "text": "A 16-year-old Caucasian girl presented to our hospital with a growing bone lesion in the roof of the left temporal bone. She had undergone a previous tympanoplasty at 7 years of age because of a cholesteatoma. At the time of that first surgery, no radiological or histological signs indicated a bone disorder. A computed tomographic scan of the temporal bone showed a lesion with rarefaction areas and lytic images inside that affected the roof of the cavity to the tegmen tympani without alterations in the inner ear. A surgical revision of the ear cavity was performed by resecting the lesion and regularizing the cavity. The histopathologic study confirmed fibrous dysplasia. The patient progressed satisfactorily after surgery with no evidence of recurrence."
