  "text": "A 69-year-old man who had previously undergone radical gastrectomy and received eight cycles of oral chemotherapy for gastric cancer showed a rapidly growing mass in his the left armpit; within just 3 mo, the mass grew to a size of 6.9 cm × 4.4 cm × 5.7 cm. Color Doppler ultrasonography and Positron emission tomography/computed tomography prompted the possibility of metastasis of the malignancy. Fine needle aspiration biopsy guided by color Doppler ultrasound showed the presence of cancer cells in the mass. Immunohistochemical examination showed CDX-2 (+), PCK (+), CK20 (+), CK7 (-), and TTF (-), which supported the metastasis of gastric cancer. Considering the risk of resection, the patient did not undergo surgical treatment."
