  "text": "A 17 year-old girl with a dominant right hand fell from the third floor and landed on the left hand. She was admitted to our hospital one hour later. Opened elbow dislocation was noticed; No radial pulse was detectable.\nRadiographic examination revealed a posterior elbow dislocation. Arteriography was not performed because of the open injury required surgical exploration very soon. The patient underwent surgery, the dislocation was reduced. Exploration of the vascular axis showed a complete disruption of the brachial artery and the vein above and the basilic vein at the same level as the aponevrotic expansion of the biceps.\nIn addition to this, exploration revealed another arterial structure. It seemed to be an accessory brachial artery because of its course on the medial side of the arm. The injury of both brachial artery and accessory brachial artery was complete. Two brachial antebrachial shunts were placed by using the ipsilateral basilic vein. The median nerve section was repaired. After vascular repair, instability after reduction was treated with an elbow cross pinning fixation by the traumatology team. After three weeks, pins were removed and passive mobilization of the elbow was begun."
