  "text": "We present the case of a 37-year-old pregnant woman with preeclampsia with severe features who developed neurological deficits that were initially attributed to her epidural anesthesia. She was eventually found to have SEH with spinal stenosis at T5-T6 on MRI. Oral antihypertensives were used to keep the patient's blood pressures within normal limits, and she subsequently had complete resolution of her neurological symptoms and her SEH on imaging."
