  "text": "The authors report a 62-year-old male who developed a nonhealing ulcer at the site of incision following nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. Past medical history included chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with rituximab. Histology of the skin lesion showed a phlegmonous nonspecific inflammation without being able to differentiate between a necrotizing wound infection and PG. The patient's condition was initially diagnosed as an infectious process and treated accordingly. After unsuccessful results with systemic antibiotics, high-dose corticosteroids induced prompt healing of the wound. On these bases, the diagnosis of postoperative PG within chronic lymphocytic leukemia and renal cell carcinoma was made."
