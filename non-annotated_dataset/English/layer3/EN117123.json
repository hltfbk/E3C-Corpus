  "text": "A 56-year-old man with coughing three months. FDG PET/CT was performed, and resection specimens of lung and thyroid were detected by hematoxylin eosin staining (HE) and IHC. PET/CT: lung tumor SUVmax: 3.69, delay: 5.17; and thyroid tumor SUVmax 19.97. HE reveal papillary adenocarcinoma, but histological differentiation of primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma from metastatic adenocarcinoma is sometimes difficult because of their phenotypic similarities. So IHC was performed, the IHC of lung tumor: cytokeratin 20 (CK20)⁻, thyroglobulin(Tg)⁻, cytokeratin7(CK7)+, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)+; thyroid tumor: CK7+, TTF-1+, thyroglobulin+, CK20⁻. Therefore, the final diagnosis was double primary adenocarcinomas of thyroid and lung."
