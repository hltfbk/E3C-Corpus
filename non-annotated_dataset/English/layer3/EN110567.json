  "text": "A 39-year-old male was admitted to our clinic with multiple pruritic masses on the scalp that had been present for four months prior to admission. He had no known history of trauma. He also had no familial history of such lesion. Upon physical examination, multiple, well-circumscribed erythematous hyperkeratotic nodules with dome-shaped appearance were present on the scalp, with measured about 1-3cm in diameter. On palpation, the mass was firm in consistency with no tenderness nor discharge with no signs of malignancy. To confirm this finding, we conducted an excisional biopsy in the largest lesion to rule out any possibilities of malignancy under local anesthesia. Histological examination showed epidermal hyperplasia with hyperkeratosis, thick parakeratosis, hypergranulosis, papillomatosis, and an intraepidermal horn cyst. The upper dermis showed dense inflammatory lymphocyte. Based on the clinical, dermoscopic and histopathological findings, a diagnosis of SK was made. We decided to treat the remaining lesions with topical 80% TCA. Prior to TCA application, Vaseline was applied to the area surrounding the lesion to prevent irritation. The lesions were then cleansed with 70% ethanol before applying 80% TCA solution using a wooden applicator until a white frosting reaction was observed. Follow-up visit one week afterwards showed significant thinning of the lesions and hyperpigmentation plaque. The biopsied wound was well closed. Four months post treatment, further significant improvement of the lesions was evident, leaving only minimal hyperpigmentation macules without alopecia."
