  "text": "We present here the case of a 53 years old patient with bilateral advanced pellucid marginal degeneration. As he is now intolerant to contact lenses a surgical option is offered to him. In order to avoid using donated tissue through corneal grafting we decide to perform a sectorial lamellar crescentric wedge excision of the thinner inferior part of the cornea involving the pellucid marginal degeneration and suture it. The first eye shows initial good results however after few months regression is observed. The second eye is then treated with the same surgical technique combined with cornea cross-linking. Long-term follow-up shows stabilization and absence of regression in the second eye up to eight months after the surgery."
