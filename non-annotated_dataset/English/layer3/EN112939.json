  "text": "We report a case of scrub typhus, which was simultaneously complicated with myocarditis and rhabdomyolysis. A 54-year-old woman presented to our hospital with myalgia in the upper and lower limbs, oedema and a fever of 7Â days' duration. We confirmed the diagnosis of scrub typhus complicated with myocarditis by pericardial fluid analysis and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results. The pericardial fluid showed characteristics of an exudate, an elevated immunofluorescence assay (IFA) IgG titer of 1:2048 and a positive 16S rRNA qPCR result. We also diagnosed rhabdomyolysis by the patient's presenting symptoms, elevated muscle enzyme levels and bone scan results."
