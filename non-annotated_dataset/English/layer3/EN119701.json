  "text": "A 90-year-old female presented with nausea and vomiting that was diagnosed as gastric cancer, the patient also had intermittent hematuria. Pelvic computed tomography identified an abnormally thickened area in the bladder wall that was diagnosed as a diverticulum of the bladder. A biopsy of the bladder wall revealed well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma metastatic from gastric carcinoma."
