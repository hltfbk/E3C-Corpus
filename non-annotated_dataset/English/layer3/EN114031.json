  "text": "A 17-year-old single Arabian female of Arab origin presented with a 2-day complaint of horizontal diplopia and transient visual obscurations. She denied any history of headache or decreased vision. The patient was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome a year prior to presentation. Examination revealed bilateral moderate papilledema and limited left eye abduction. However, visual acuity and fields were normal. Increased intracranial pressure was confirmed by lumbar puncture opening pressure (550 mm H<Sub>2</Sub>O). The cerebrospinal fluid composition and imaging of brain and cerebral venous system were normal. The diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension was confirmed and the patient was treated with acetazolamide 500 mg twice per day. The symptoms totally resolved within 3 days and the papilledema disappeared after 2 months."
