  "text": "A 21-year old male patient presented with abdominal pain and vomiting for one day. A contrast enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed duodenal intussusception. On emergency laparotomy, the intussusception had reduced spontaneously while an invaginated diverticulum was seen at the junction of the descending and horizontal segments of the duodenum. The diverticulum was resected and the patient had uneventful recovery."
