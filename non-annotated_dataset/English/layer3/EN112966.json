  "text": "A 55-year-old man with severe left ventricular dysfunction underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with the preoperative use of an intra-aortic balloon pump. Postoperative course was complicated by renal and hepatic failure. The early occurrence of complications during 36 hours after operation exhibited a serious vascular complication. The combination of acute renal and hepatic failure led to the suspension to occlusive effect of intra-aortic balloon pump catheter on ostium of the aforementioned organs. The intra-aortic balloon pump was removed, and urine output immediately restored. Thereafter, daily slop dawn serum levels of aminotransferases were started, and became normal at the 10th day of operation."
