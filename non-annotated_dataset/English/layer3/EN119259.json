  "text": "After 0.005% latanoprost was administered topically to a patient with ocular hypertension due to a pseudoexfoliation syndrome and a subluxated lens, the position of the lens was examined by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and the ciliary body thickness by ultrasound biomicroscopy. The lens had moved posteriorly, and the thickness of the ciliary body had decreased after the latanoprost."
