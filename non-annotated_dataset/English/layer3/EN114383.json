  "text": "We report the case of a 3-month-old male infant with bilateral corneal opacity since birth who was transferred from the pediatric unit for further ophthalmic care. He was diagnosed with PA with subsequent systemic-associated malformations including craniofacial defects and skeletal defects. He was managed minimally with topical mydriatics and antiglaucomatous drugs."
