  "text": "We report the case of a 10-year-old boy with ADHD/ASD comorbid with TS who was treated with guanfacine (GUAN). He experienced several side effects of atomoxetine (ATX) and methylphenidate (MPH) before being treated with GUAN. In the presented case, symptoms of ADHD as well as tic symptoms were improved by treatment with GUAN."
