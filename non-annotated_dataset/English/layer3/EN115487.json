  "text": "A 33-year-old South Asian male presented with coryzal symptoms including a persistent cough with an asymmetrical swelling of the left side of the face. Imaging revealed a mass lesion involving the para-nasal sinuses eroding into the orbit. Histology and the clinical picture were compatible with inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour. As curative excision of the tumour was not feasible, medical management was offered. Despite early features of remission to glucocorticoids, tapering resulted in recurrence. Hence combination therapy with glucocorticoids and methotrexate was commenced with dramatic reduction of tumour burden and the patient has been in remission to date."
