  "text": "A 63-year-old male patient with a 6-mo old history of neck trauma presented with a black-brown foreign body in the lateral wall of the esophagus. Neck and chest computed tomography (CT) revealed that two superior mediastinal foreign bodies penetrated the esophagus diagonally. We removed two foreign bodies through an esophagoscope. Owing to the rigid working channel of esophagoscope and good exposure of endoscope, the risk of injury to the adjacent vital tissues was minimized. Postoperative comprehensive therapies, including antibiotic administration and nutritional support, resulted in a prompt postoperative recovery. Postoperative CT confirmed the absence of a residual foreign body and neck and chest infections. In addition, upper gastrointestinal angiography and gastroscopy revealed the absence of an evident esophageal perforation. The patient received an oral diet and did not experience any complication at the time of discharge from the hospital."
