  "text": "A woman was presented at the Accident and Emergency Department complaining of pain over the lower thorax bilaterally which started after a difficult delivery when the obstetrician forced her lower thorax. Small right-sided haemothorax and rib fractures bilaterally were diagnosed and she was admitted to hospital. Her in-hospital stay and follow up was uneventful."
