  "text": "The patient was identified as a 36-year-old woman with a presacral mass and pelvic floor pain. A digital rectal examination revealed a presacral mass with unclear margins and obvious tenderness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a 57 mm Ã— 29 mm presacral lump. An ultrasound-guided needle biopsy confirmed a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor. No other primary or metastatic tumors were found."
