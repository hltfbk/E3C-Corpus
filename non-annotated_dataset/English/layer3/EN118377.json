  "text": "A 45-year-old caucasian uniparous woman presented with uterine bleeding. She had several surgical procedures and pathology of removed recurrent polyps showed no malignancy. Finally, a total abdominal hysterectomy was performed because of atypical cells and suspected uterine adenosarcoma. The hysterectomy specimen confirmed the presence of uterine adenosarcoma associated with lymphatic and vascular tumor emboli. Surgery was completed with a second bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy."
