  "text": "A 68-year-old man with metastatic rectal cancer was treated with bevacizumab. He presented with hematuria and proteinuria 15 and 17 months, respectively, after bevacizumab initiation. Bevacizumab was stopped at 17 months. Renal biopsy at 19 months revealed immunoglobulin A nephropathy, with numerous paramesangial hemispherical deposits and thrombotic microangiopathy. Electron microscopy showed numerous paramesangial electron-dense deposits of various sizes, and subendothelial injuries. Proteinuria almost completely resolved 8 months after bevacizumab cessation, although hematuria persisted. Follow-up renal biopsy 11 months after bevacizumab cessation showed a marked decrease in mesangial immunoglobulin A deposits and paramesangial electron-dense deposits, which correlated with a gradual decrease in serum immunoglobulin A."
