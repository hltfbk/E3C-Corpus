  "text": "We launched a phase I trial incorporating four weekly doses of IFN-Î³ in an ACT regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide (HD Cy), NY-ESO-1-specific T cells, and postinfusion low-dose interleukin (IL)-2. Two patients were treated. While one patient had significant tumor regression and resultant clinical benefit, the other patient suffered a fatal histiocytic myocarditis. Therefore, this cohort was terminated for safety concerns."
