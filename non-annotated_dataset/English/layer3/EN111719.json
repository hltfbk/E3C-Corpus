  "text": "A 71-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer developed tetraparesis and near fatal rhabdomyolysis after initiation of first cycle Palbociclib. For 10 years prior to this treatment, the patient had been treated with Simvastatin without myalgia or other neuromuscular complaints prior to the first cycle of Palbociclib. The patient was admitted at the neurology department, where Palbociclib and Simvastatin were discontinued. The patient was aggressively hydrated and treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy with slowly remission and finally regaining independent gait function. Evaluation showed a negative myositis antibody work-up. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging showed edema in multiple foci, but skeletal muscle biopsy did not show necrosis. Post discharge genetic analysis showed single heterozygosity for nucleotide polymorphism rs4149056."
