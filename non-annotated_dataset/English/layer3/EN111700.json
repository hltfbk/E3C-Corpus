  "text": "We present a case of self-harm in a patient with ESKD suffering from acute delirium. A man in his mid-seventies was admitted with fungal peritoneal dialysis (PD) associated peritonitis. On the first day post operatively, he was found with absent vital signs due to exsanguination from newly inserted central catheter which he which had self-severed. He died a few days later as a result of the self-harm gesture."
