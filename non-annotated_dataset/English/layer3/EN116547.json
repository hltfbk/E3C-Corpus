  "text": "A 41-year-old male presented with gradually progressive quadriparesis for past 6 months. Patient had low phosphorous (1.9 mg/dl) with calcium being 8.1 mg/dl and 25(OH)Vitamin D3 levels being 8.12 ng/ml. The patient was thought to have concomitant Vitamin D deficiency with possibility of tumor-induced osteomalacia. Further evaluation for the same was planned. However, patient was given a trial of Vitamin D supplementation before further investigations and had dramatic improvement in the form that muscle power improved gradually over next 6 weeks and was able to climb stairs after 2 months. Retrospectively patient gave a history of being at home for many months and there was no exposure to sunlight at all. The biochemical parameters normalized within 4 weeks of starting Vitamin D and serum alkaline phosphatase showed drastic reduction after 6 weeks. All his family members were screened and found to have Vitamin D deficiency including recent born twins having rachitic changes. This was a case of vitamin D deficiency, in 41-year-old male, which presented more like hypophosphatemic osteomalacia but characteristic history of lack of sunlight exposure and dramatic improvement with only vitamin D3 supplementation confirmed the diagnosis."
