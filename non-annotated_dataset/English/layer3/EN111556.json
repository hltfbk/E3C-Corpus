  "text": "A 61-year-old male patient underwent a laparoscopic distal gastrectomy and D1+ lymph node dissection with Roux-en-Y reconstruction for early gastric cancer. He was discharged on postoperative day (POD) 9 without any complications, such as anastomotic or pancreatic leakage. On POD 19, he was referred to the emergency room for upper abdominal pain. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed a 60 × 70 mm hematoma, indicating intra-abdominal bleeding and a 10-mm pseudoaneurysm in the RIPA. Selective digital subtraction angiography confirmed the presence of a pseudoaneurysm in the RIPA, which was embolized using multiple microcoils. Thereafter, no clinical signs were observed, and the patient was discharged from the hospital 15 days after angiography without any recurrence of bleeding. We hypothesized that the cause of the pseudoaneurysm was mechanical vascular injury due to the thermal spread of the ultrasonically activated devices (USADs) during lymphatic node dissection."
