  "text": "We present two brothers with intractable seizures and syndromic intellectual disability with symptoms consisting of delayed development, intellectual disability, and speech and language delay. The mother was a symptomatic carrier with milder clinical phenotype. Whole exome sequencing identified a small fragment deletion spanning four exons, about 9.5 kilobases (kb) in length in the CNKSR2 gene in the patients. The mutation co-segregation revealed that exon deletions occurred de novo in the proband's mother."
