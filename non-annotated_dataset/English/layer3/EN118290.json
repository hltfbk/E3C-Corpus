  "text": "A 34-year-old G4P3 Caucasian woman was followed up antenatally because of a stillbirth in her previous pregnancy. At 36 weeks' gestation, a hypoechoic, 3.6 x 4.2 cm rounded mass was noted within the placenta on ultrasound examination. Histologically, the tumor was a benign leiomyoma and this finding was supported by immunohistochemistry. The newborn infant was male. Chromosomes of the neoplasm were studied by the fluorescence in situ hybridization technique and the tumor was found to carry XX chromosomes."
