  "text": "A 72-year-old male with a history of alcohol induced HCC presented with multiple intrahepatic recurrences and tumorous lesions in the stomach and ascending colon. Three years earlier, he underwent right hemihepatectomy, and 1 year ago, he had a video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection for pulmonary metastasis of HCC. We decided on surgical resection of the new metastases because of massive gastric bleeding and concern for possible colonic obstruction. The patient underwent gastric wedge resection and right hemicolectomy. Two weeks later, the patient developed dysarthria and mild cognitive disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a left frontal lobe lesion, and he underwent resection of a metastatic brain tumor. Unfortunately, he died 6 weeks after the last surgery due to hepatorenal syndrome."
