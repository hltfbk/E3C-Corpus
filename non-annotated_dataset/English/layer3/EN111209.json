In order to relieve the radiating neuralgia and reduce the damage to spinal stability, the minimally invasive PTED was performed.The patient's prognosis was assessed using Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). During the follow-up, the patient's ODI and VAS scores were decreased significantly. The radiating pain in the inguinal and inner thigh region of right side were significantly alleviated and the discomfort caused by lower back instability was improved by plaster vest."
