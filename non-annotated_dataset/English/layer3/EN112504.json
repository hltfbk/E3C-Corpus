  "text": "Between August 2013 and June 2016, three patients with a large HCC (maximum diameter: 5.0, 5.7, and 8.1 cm) in the caudate lobe were treated by transarterial chemoembolization followed by computer tomography (CT) guided RFA using a monopolar perfusion RF electrode, which was enhanced by local infusion of 10% HCl at 0.2 mL/min (total volume, 3 to 12 mL). The output power of HRFA reached 100 W, and the average ablation time was 39 min (range, 15 to 60 min). Two patients each underwent one session of HRFA and one patient two sessions. After treatment, CT/magnetic resonance imaging showed that all the three lesions were completely ablated. There was no major complication. Two patients had asymptomatic bile duct dilatation. One patient died of tongue cancer 24 mo after ablation. The remaining two patients were alive and no area of enhancement is detected in the caudate lobe at 28 and 60 mo after ablation, respectively."
