  "text": "We report two cases of interpositional arthroplasties done in young patients secondary to posttraumatic event. The first case is 22-year-old female with a history of stiff elbow following a posttraumatic event 3 years back and the second case is 24-year-old male laborer with stiff elbow following trauma more the 10 years back for which he took native treatment. In both the cases through posterior approach to the elbow, we did osteolysis and prepared fascia lata grafts are interpositioned over the recreated articular surfaces. Both the patients in the follow-up have a good range of motion, stability and are satisfied."
