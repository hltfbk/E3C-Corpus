  "text": "We report the case of a patient that developed an intramural duodenal hematoma after endoscopic treatment for a bleeding ulcer who also was undergoing conventional hemodialysis for chronic renal failure associated with lupus nephritis. A hemoperitoneum and near-total duodenal obstruction developed but spontaneously resolved with conservative treatment."
