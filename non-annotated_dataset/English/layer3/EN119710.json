  "text": "We report a case of a man in whom urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma, metachronous prostate adenocarcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma were diagnosed within an eighteen-month period. The only known predisposing factor was that he was heavy smoker (90-100 packets per year). The literature on the phenomenon of multiple primary malignancies in a single patient is reviewed and the data is summarized."
