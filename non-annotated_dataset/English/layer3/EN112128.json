  "text": "The patient was a 32-year-old man. Laryngoscopy revealed tonsillar hypertrophy, and the patient underwent a low-temperature plasma tonsillectomy. Microscopic examination of permanent sections showed lymphoid follicular hyperplasia, a portion of which appeared to be a fusion of nodular hyperplasia (composed of lymphoid follicles of variable size and shape). These distinctive follicles with atrophic hyalinized germinal centers and a broad mantle zone of small lymphocytes formed concentric rings (so-called onion-skin arrangement). Medium-sized vessels and a plethora of capillaries were present in the center of the lymphatic follicles, mantle zones, and interfollicular areas. A characteristic lollipop appearance was also observed due to the onion-skin arrangement of the expanded mantle zone lymphocytes with a vessel penetrating the germinal center. No aberrant lymphoid population was present based on CD3, CD5, CD20, CD79Î±, CD21, CD23, bcl-2, cyclin D1, and ki-67 immunostaining. Tests for human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 and Epstein Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA (EBER) were negative. Therefore, a diagnosis of an HV variant UCD was rendered. The patient was treated by local excision without any other therapy based on the diagnosis. At the 7-month follow up, the patient had no recurrent symptoms or masses."
