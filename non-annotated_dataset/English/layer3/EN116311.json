  "text": "A previously healthy 32-year-old male presented at our ENT (ear, nose and throat) outpatient clinic after experiencing a parotid region swelling for 2 months. The patient was treated surgically by excising the mass and by modified radical ipsilateral neck dissection. Histological and immunohistochemical examination indicated masseteric alveolar RMS with lymphatic metastasis. The patient received radiochemotherapy, and he is still alive with no evidence of disease spread 1 year after diagnosis."
