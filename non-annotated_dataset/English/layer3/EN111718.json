  "text": "We present an unusual urban case of acute liver failure due to visceral leishmaniasis, following a prolonged fever of unknown origin. After obtaining negative results from the bone marrow aspirate, we performed a liver biopsy that elucidated the diagnosis. The liver involvement in visceral leishmaniasis may appear as chronic granulomatous hepatitis. However diffuse hepatitis process, a necro-inflammatory pattern, without forming granulomas were observed in the liver biopsy specimens in this case. Intracytoplasmic Leishmania amastigotes were observed in the liver biopsy specimens and a polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis. Only five pathological confirmed cases of acute hepatitis due to visceral leishmaniasis have been described so far, just two in adults and both from Barcelona. A revision of the literature is performed."
