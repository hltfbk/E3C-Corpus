  "text": "We encountered a rare case of a 16-year-old male who has osteochondral lesion of the talus (OLT) with gout. He had fluctuating pain for more than 2 years. We could see intra-articular tophi with magnetic resonance image (MRI) and arthroscopy. We performed arthroscopic exploration, debridement and microfracture. Symptoms were resolved after operation, and bony coverage at the lesion was seen on postoperative images. We had checked image and uric acid levels for 18 mo."
