  "text": "We report the 4th case of association of KS and CAH in a young man with CAH with good androgen control and with normal secondary sex characteristics, whose Klinefelter syndrome was diagnosed because of reduced testicular volume. He was the first reported case of association of KS and CAH who started androgen replacement therapy in the pubertal age and whose pubertal development was described and followed up step by step."
