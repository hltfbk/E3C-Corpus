  "text": "We describe a case of an otherwise healthy 71-year-old African male who presented with a PSA of 5800 ng/ml and a prostate volume of over 1000cc. Unique aspects of this case include the size of the prostate, the apparent absence of distant metastases, and the safe usage of transabdominal biopsy of this mass."
