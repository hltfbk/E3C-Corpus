  "text": "A 50-year-old male with a history of metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and who had a partially covered metallic stent placed in the biliary tree 1 year ago presented to the oncology clinic with fatigue, abdominal pain, and hypotension. He was planned for ERCP for possible cholangitis secondary to obstructed previously placed biliary stent. However, the duodenoscope could not be advanced to the level of the major papilla because of narrowed pylorus and severely strictured duodenal sweep. Forward-view gastroscope was then passed with careful manipulation to the severely narrowed second part of the duodenum where the previously placed metallic stent was visualized. Balloon sweeping of stenting was done. Cholangiography did not show any leak. Following the procedure, the patient underwent CT scan of the abdomen that showed pneumoperitoneum which was communicating with pneumobilia through a loculated air collection in necrotic hepatic metastasis perforating Glisson's capsule. The patient was managed conservatively."
