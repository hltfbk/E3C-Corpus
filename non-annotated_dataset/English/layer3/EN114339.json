  "text": "An 83-year-old man with exertional angina was referred to our hospital. Coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis in the proximal portion of the right coronary artery and left circumflex artery and chronic total occlusion (CTO) in the mid portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). We performed complete revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention. Because the CTO lesion in LAD contained napkin-ring heavy calcifications, rotational atherectomy with a 1.75-mm burr was undergone, followed by the deployment of drug-eluting stents and postdilation with a high-pressure balloon. However, expansion of the stent was incomplete. To address the recurrence of in-stent restenosis and resistance to the dilation with the high-pressure balloon, we decided to simultaneously ablate both the heavy calcification and underexpanded stent. Longitudinal stent ablation with 1.75- and 2.0-mm burrs was successful, and OCT demonstrated that the metallic component of the underexpanded stent had been completely removed."
