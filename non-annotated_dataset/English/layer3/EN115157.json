  "text": "We describe a case of a young healthy female who presented to a community hospital Emergency department without any trauma designation following a motor vehicle accident. The patient was found to have hemorrhagic shock from an intramammary hemorrhage and was treated with blood products and a temporizing external abdominal binder in preparation for a transfer to a level 1 center where she was successfully treated with angiographic embolization."
