  "text": "A 12-year-old Saudi boy of Arab ethnicity presented to the King Saud Medical City emergency department with bleeding per rectum and mild abdominal pain following blunt trauma to his abdomen. On examination, his abdomen was slightly tender, bowel sounds were present, and he was hemodynamically stable. During admission, rectal bleeding was ongoing. On day 3 he deteriorated with decreasing blood pressure and hemoglobin, and increasing pulse rate with fever. After resuscitation and stabilization, he was urgently taken to the operating room for further diagnostic management and treatment. His nasogastric tube revealed bile without blood, and an intraoperative colonoscopy revealed altered blood within his whole colon and terminal ileum without a definite bleeding site. A laparotomy was performed, and an injured branch of the mesenteric artery supplying the Meckel's diverticulum was identified as the source of the significant arterial bleeding. Suture ligation controlled the bleeding, and the Meckel's diverticulum was resected. The patient remained stable after that until discharge without any further intestinal bleeding."
