  "text": "A 28-year-old male patient from Turkey presented to our clinic with complaints of palpable foreign bodies under the skin on the dorsolateral side of his right foot. Except for the palpable and moving body of about 6 cm length under the skin in his foot, he had no functional complaints. On X-ray, a Kirschner wire was visible in front of the lateral malleolus on the dorsolateral side of his right foot. In addition, there was a cerclage wire from the tension band fixation of his patella in the ipsilateral knee. The Kirschner wire was removed surgically."
