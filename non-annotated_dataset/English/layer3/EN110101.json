  "text": "A 1-day old girl normally delivered after an uneventful pregnancy, weighing 3.200 Kg referred to us with a suspected diagnosis of esophageal atresia due to excessive salivation, regurgitation with an impossibility to pass a nasogastric tube. Physical examination did not reveal any overt signs, but an orogastric tube was arrested at 12 cm from the gum margin. Plain X-ray of the chest with orogastric tube in situ demonstrated the presence of tip of the tube at 6 thoracic vertebral level as well as the presence of an abnormal gas shadow in the chest. Subsequent contrast study ruled out esophageal atresia and demonstrated partial herniation of the stomach through a large hiatal hernia, and organoaxial gastic volvulus. The patient underwent emergency surgical repair via laparotomy because of distress respiratory and the risk of gastric perforation. At exploration, the stomach was found herniated into the chest through a large hiatal defect, twisted but not ischemic, gastroperitoneal attachments and gastric ligaments were absent with mobile spleen, there was no abdominal malformation. After untwisting, the stomach was reduced into the abdominal, the hiatal defect was repaired and a Thal fundoplication was performed, and a gastropexy was added to the procedure. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. At 1-year follow-up she is asymptomatic and growing well."
