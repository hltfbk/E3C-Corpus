  "text": "A 78-year-old female patient with permanent indwelling catheter due to paraplegia presented in the outpatient's office for catheter replacement. The patient was otherwise healthy, with no concomitant diseases, apart from a history of traumatic spinal cord injury 30 years ago. The latex foley catheter had been replaced 30 days ago and had a normal appearance. Since it was not possible to deflate the balloon initially, even after cutting off the balloon valve, this new technique was performed: The catheter was clamped and preserved with a Kelly forceps proximal to the external urethral orifice omitting the insufflation track Figure 1. No balloon deflation was achieved with this maneuver and thus we proceeded to the next step. A needle of a 20G intravenous catheter set (blue DISPOFLONÂ® I.V. Catheter) was removed from the cannula Figure 2. The detached foley catheter with the forceps was positioned in such a way that the insufflation track was above the clamped urine tract of the catheter. Then, the needle was gently inserted through the insufflation track at approximately 3cm (the needle is 5cm long). A slight upwards pressure was applied to the with the surgeons left index finger which was inserted into the vagina, in order to angulate the distal end of the catheter Figure 3. Finally, the non-deflated balloon was punctured by the needle after completing its insertion and the catheter could be removed. The patient required no anesthesia of any type and the whole procedure was fast and well tolerated in the outpatient's office. The same technique was used in several ex-vivo models including latex foley catheters and silicone catheters in different sizes, effectively."
