  "text": "A 23-year-old male who sustained a high-energy trauma due to road traffic accident. He presented to ER with fracture of shaft femur, multi-ligament injury at the ipsilateral knee, fracture lower pole patella, ipsilateral fracture talus, and calcaneus along with comminuted fracture femoral head. He was managed by open reduction and internal fixation of the femoral head by safe surgical dislocation of the hip joint. Such injuries have been described rarely in the literature until now. The purpose of this report is to highlight the extreme rarity, possible mechanism involved, surgical management, and functional outcomes of such injuries."
