  "text": "A 37-year old female patient with a history of 15 years of bulimia nervosa was admitted to the emergency department 24 h after binge eating. Abdominal Computed Tomography imaging showed major gastric distension reaching the pelvis and compressing the digestive organs. Total gastrectomy was required because of gastric necrosis. The patient reported significant reduction in bulimic symptoms after gastrectomy."
