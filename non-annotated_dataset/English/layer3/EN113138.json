  "text": "A 69-year-old woman presented with progressive myelopathic symptoms and thoracic radicular pain. MRI imaging of the whole spine showed an enhancing intradural extramedullary lesion extending from the cervical cord to T11 causing cord compression. Laminectomies were performed for surgical decompression and histopathology was consistent with pilocytic astrocytoma. Complete staging was done that included imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid cytology. No other tumor was found by these methods. Postoperatively the patient was treated with large field spinal radiation and concurrent chemotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. She has thus far been clinically and radiographically stable."
