  "text": "We report here a rare case of retroperitoneal schwannoma with multiple origins from retroperitoneum and pelvic wall. Pathological examination confirmed the case as a schwannoma with malignant transformation. Radical dissection of the tumors along with the sacrifice of adjacent sigmoid colon and left kidney failed to provide a cure for this patient. Due to tumor recurrence, a second and a third surgery of radical excision were performed 6 months and 17 months later after the first surgery, respectively. Histopathologic analysis identified that the recurrent tumors were different from the original schwannoma because of their smooth muscle-like differentiation."
