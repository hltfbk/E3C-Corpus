  "text": "We report a case of BP with malignant transformation in a 52-year-old female patient who presented with emaciation, severe malnutrition, and a T-tube for biliary drainage that was placed for almost 2 years at the time she visited us. The enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the upper abdomen revealed a neoplasm with a diameter of 15 cm located in the gallbladder area surrounding the common bile duct where a drainage tube was placed. It was the first case with malignant BP involving multiple organs and the abdominal wall and receiving a radical resection. Plastic surgeons helped close the incision by transferring the rectus muscle and external oblique muscle flap. A diagnosis of papillary carcinoma with diffuse malignant papillomatosis of the biliary duct was given. The postoperative course was uneventful and she was asymptomatic and in good physical condition at 35 mo postoperatively with appropriate chemotherapy."
