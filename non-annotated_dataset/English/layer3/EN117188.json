  "text": "We report a case of a 51-year-old Caucasian Greek woman who presented to our hospital with liver metastases as the first manifestation of an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the left submandibular gland. The liver lesions were deemed inoperable because of their size and multi-focality and proved resistant to systemic chemotherapy. She was curatively treated with a combination of doxorubicin eluting bead (DC Beads) chemoembolization, intra-operative and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, and radiofrequency-assisted surgical resection. The patient remained disease-free one year after the surgical resection."
