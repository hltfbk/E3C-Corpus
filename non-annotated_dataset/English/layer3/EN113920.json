  "text": "A 75-year-old man who underwent a radical gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma was admitted to clinical oncology center for gingival mass which was originally diagnosed as epulis. The subsequent positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and histopathological examination revealed a gingival metastatic adenocarcinoma originated from gastric carcinoma. Then three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) with synchronization and sequential chemotherapy demonstrated clinical benefit in this patient. Furthermore, this research reviewed the records of 18 cases of gingival metastasis from gastric carcinoma in English, Japanese, and Chinese literature, and summarized the clinicopathologic features of the disease based on previously published papers."
