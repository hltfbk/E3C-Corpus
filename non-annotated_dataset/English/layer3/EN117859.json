  "text": "We present a 33-year-old Caucasian woman with an acetabular bone defect caused by tuberculous arthritis of the left hip joint. Instead of performing a resection arthroplasty followed by total hip arthroplasty in a second stage, we decided to intentionally ankylose the hip joint in order to fill up the acetabular defect with the patient's own femoral head. Two years after the start of a one year course of tuberculostatic chemotherapy, we took down the ankylosed hip and placed an uncemented total hip prosthesis. The technical and functional outcome of this procedure appeared to be very favourable, the acetabular defect was filled up and the bone remodeled completely."
