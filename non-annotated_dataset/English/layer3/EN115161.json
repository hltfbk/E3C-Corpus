  "text": "Within a week of onset of her first episode of acute anterior uveitis, a 45 year-old Caucasian lady developed profound ocular hypotony with unrecordable intraocular pressures, reduced vision and choroidal folds. All investigations were negative. Uveitic hypotony responded slowly to corticosteroids--intravenous, oral and topical--with normalization of intraocular pressure and resolution of choroidal folds after two months. Anterior uveitis and hypotony have not returned with six months of follow-up."
