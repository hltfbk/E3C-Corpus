  "text": "We evaluated the effects of SOF/RBV combination therapy in two patients with genotype 2a who could not achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) by OBV/PTV/r+RBV combination therapy. One patient was complicated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. Resistance-associated variations before SOF/RBV combination therapy were not detected in two patients. Both patients had an SVR at 12 wk after the treatment (SVR12). Regarding adverse events (AEs), itching, chill, a dull feeling in the throat and cough as well as increase of alanine transaminase level were shown in one patient, while a headache and deterioration of light aversion probably due to the recurrence of VKH disease were shown in the other patients. In addition, the latter patient developed arthralgia and morning stiffness approximately 7 wk after the therapy and turned out to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthralgia."
