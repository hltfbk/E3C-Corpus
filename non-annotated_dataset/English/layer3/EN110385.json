  "text": "A 42 years old, systemically healthy male visited the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Dentistry, University of Abant Izzet Baysal, Bolu, Turkey for a routine check-up. His panoramic radiogram revealed an irregularly bordered radiolucent lesion with approximately 2cm diameter around the impacted right mandibular wisdom tooth. A cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed to examine the lesion in detail. CBCT images showed calcification foci and close relationship of the lesion with inferior alveolar nerve. There was no sign of a lesion in intraoral and extraoral inspection. The mucosa around the lesion area had normal color, and bone hardness was felt at the area. The patient did not have any symptoms such as pain or paresthesia. The lesion was enucleated under local anesthesia and was sent to histopathological examination. Histopathological examination of the sections revealed dense, mixed inflammatory cell infiltration and diffuse psammomatous calcification in the fibrous tissue specimens that had walled structure. There were ghost cells in one focus. At the end of 6 months, the lesion healed without problems, and the patient is currently under follow-up."
