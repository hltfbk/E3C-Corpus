  "text": "A 52 year old man presented with history of intermittent pain with swelling in second toe since 6 months. Radiograph showed a lytic lesion in proximal phalanx of the great toe. CT and MRI reported non specific lesion in the toe. Pain was quite severe and as the patient was a labourer and wanted to get back to his work as soon as possible a decision of disarticulation of the second toe at metatarsophalnageal joint was taken. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and patient was called for regular follow up. There are no complications and recurrence at two year follow up."
