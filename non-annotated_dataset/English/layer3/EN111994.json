  "text": "53-year-old female patient presented myelopathic sign including gait disturbance and both leg weakness (Grade 3) for 4 months after slip down, and has the history of anti-epileptic medication for several years. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed cord compression by the mixed-type OPLL from T5 to T9, and decompressive surgery was planned. Sudden onset generalized tonic-clonic seizure attack developed before the surgery. Hypocalcemia (3.7 mg/dL) with QT prolongation on electrocardiogram, hypomagnesemia (1.4 mg/dL), hyperphosphatemia (7.7 mg/dL), hypoparathyroidism, and normal range of vitamin D was noted. Brain study showed Fahr's syndrome with multiple and symmetric calcification of basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. Decompressive laminectomy was performed after transient correction of hypocalcemia. The myelopathic symptoms improved to normal walking by the 14-month follow-up. The cause of hypoparathyroidism was concluded to be idiopathic."
