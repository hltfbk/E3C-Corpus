  "text": "We present a case report of a 15-year-old patient with recurrent penoscrotal edema and swelling of both lower extremities. The literature were also reviewed to provide additional information. Physical examination revealed slow lymphatic reflux of the lower extremities and no obvious abnormalities in testicular morphology, bilaterally, or blood supply. Surgery was performed by excising the affected skin and subcutaneous tissue and the flaps was cut in the middle in Y shape to cover the penis and scrotum. Postoperative follow-up revealed wound integrity and patient satisfaction with the outcome."
