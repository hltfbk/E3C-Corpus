  "text": "Here, we report an unusual case of jersey finger injury in a 45-year-old male patient, where the FDP tendon was found in front of the middle phalanx with a large, fractured fragment of the middle third of the distal phalanx attached to it. This type of injury pattern has not been acknowledged in the commonly used classification systems. The patient was operated with open reduction and K-wire fixation of the bony fragment with a good functional outcome."
