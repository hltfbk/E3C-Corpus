  "text": "Here we describe the case of a 39-year-old Japanese man with neurofibromatosis type 1 complicated by the rupture of a dissecting aneurysm in his superior rectal artery. Our patient presented with temporary loss of consciousness and acute abdominal pain. Hemorrhagic shock and anemia were diagnosed based on a physical examination and laboratory investigations, and rapid infusion of Ringer's lactate solution was initiated. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed hemorrhagic ascites with effusion of radiopaque dye into his pelvic cavity. A ruptured aneurysm was suspected in his superior rectal artery and selective angiography of the inferior mesenteric artery confirmed this diagnosis. Transcatheter arterial embolization was successfully performed and our patient was discharged 15 days after admission, with good recovery of his hemoglobin level, and no further hemorrhage or abdominal pain."
