  "text": "Our first case was a 37-year-old Japanese man with left renal cell carcinoma extending into the inferior vena cava below the main hepatic vein (level II) and our second was a 75-year-old Japanese man with right renal cell carcinoma extending into the retrohepatic inferior vena cava at the main hepatic vein (level III). En block resection of the kidney and the tumor thrombus was performed with the aid of partial extracorporeal circulation; the postoperative course of both patients was uneventful."
