  "text": "A term pregnant Cameroonian woman was admitted to our maternity unit with clinical findings suggestive of a strangulated umbilical hernia. She underwent an emergency caesarean section which fortuitously revealed aseptic necrobiosis of a uterine fibroid, managed within the same surgical intervention by myomectomy. Her post-operative course was uneventful."
