  "text": "We report a case of PPMS with molecular confirmation using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and DNA sequencing in a 45-year-old female patient. Computer tomography (CT) scanning revealed a peripheral circumscribed solid mass of 2.1 × 2 cm in the right lung superior lobe. Histologically, the tumor cells ranged from stellate, polygonal to chondrocyte-like or physaliferous-like, forming reticular network of delicate lace-like cellular strands and cords in abundant myxoid stroma. The tumor cell immunophenotype was positive for vimentin, EMA and negative for CK-pan, TTF-1, CAM5.2, S-100, calponin, SMA, desmin, ALK, CD31 and CD34. Molecular analysis demonstrated EWSR1-CREB1 gene fusion in this tumor. During 38 months of follow-up, the patient was alive with no clinical or radiological evidence of recurrence or metastasis."
