  "text": "A 73-year-old Caucasian woman underwent a right parieto-occipital craniotomy to remove a meningioma. The procedure was performed in the prone position and lasted for 7 hours. One hour after the end of surgery, left submandibular gland swelling was clearly visible and in a few hours, she developed massive facial edema. Imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance) showed inflammatory swelling of the submandibular and parotid glands and of the periglandular tissues, undilated excretory ducts, and complete obliteration of the pharynx lumen (pharyngeal mucosa adhered to the endotracheal tube). Analgesics, corticosteroids, and antibiotics were administered. Edema regressed from the 4th postoperative day and the endotracheal tube could be removed on the 7th postoperative day. The patient was discharged from the surgical intensive care unit on the 14th postoperative day and from hospital on the 28th postoperative day."
