  "text": "A previously healthy 28 days old male neonate presented with a history of irritability, fever, and focal seizures. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and culture confirmed the diagnosis of group A streptococcal meningitis. The clinical course was complicated by the development of brain abscess. The patient made full recovery following a surgical drainage of the abscess and a 6-week total course of antibiotics."
