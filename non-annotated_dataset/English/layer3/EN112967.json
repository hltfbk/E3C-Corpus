  "text": "A 45-year-old man was referred to our center due to Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. After trans-septal puncture, contrast injection into the sheath showed that it was in the left ventricle (LV) rather than left atrium. Trans-esophageal echocardiography confirmed left ventricle outflow tract to right atrial (RA) jet. Follow-up echocardiography showed that the tract was present up to 18 months, but considering that the patient was asymptomatic, endovascular or surgical closure was not done."
