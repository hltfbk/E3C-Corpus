  "text": "A 69-year-old Latino man was referred to Hepatology Clinic for urgent evaluation of new onset jaundice, nausea and fatigue associated with a >40-fold increase in his transaminase levels and elevated INR and alkaline phosphatase. The patient had received a new prescription for varenicline to aid with smoking cessation approximately 3 weeks prior to his evaluation in Hepatology Clinic. Within 5 days of starting the varenicline, the patient developed new onset of nausea, vomiting, malaise and deep jaundice. The varenicline was discontinued on day 5 by the patient. Hepatologic evaluation revealed no evidence of acute viral hepatitis, autoimmune, metabolic or alcohol-related liver disorders. The patient's past medical history was notable, however, for chronic hepatitis C. His liver enzymes and synthetic function completely normalized 9 weeks after discontinuation of the varenicline."
