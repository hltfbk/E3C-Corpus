  "text": "A 54-year-old Sri Lankan female with a past history of a cholecystostomy presented with symptoms suggestive of small intestinal obstruction. Evidence of ileal obstruction with pneumobilia in the supine radiograph of the abdomen and cholecyto-duodenal fistula in the water soluble contrast study was suggestive of the diagnosis of gallstone ileus. An enterolithotomy was performed with no attempt of closure of the cholecysto-duodenal fistula."
