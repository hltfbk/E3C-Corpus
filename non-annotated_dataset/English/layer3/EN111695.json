  "text": "A 36-year-old female, suffering from SLE for 10 years with effects on the central nervous system, developed diabetes mellitus (DM) triggered by the steroid therapy for SLE. The patient was undergoing steroid therapy (6 mg/day) for SLE since a long time. For DM management, her HbA1c level was maintained at 7.4%. She was 158 cm tall and 91.6 kg in weight. Her body mass index was 36.7. She could not work and depended on welfare services. To improve her obesity and DM, physicians suggested that she should undergo bariatric surgery in our hospital. Eventually, she underwent LSG, which lasted for 185 min, with minimal blood loss and without complications. Her blood glucose level stabilized immediately after the surgery; hence, her antidiabetic medication was discontinued. She was discharged 8 days after surgery, and her weight decreased steadily. In the first year after surgery, her weight was 54.4 kg, and she had lost approximately 37 kg from her initial weight. Her steroid requirement had also reduced to 4 mg/day. Through weight loss, she could begin to work and became a part of society again."
