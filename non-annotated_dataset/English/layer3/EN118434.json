  "text": "We describe a case of a 32 year old male Caucasian who presented with a tender, midline, infraumbilical mass and purulent umbilical discharge. Diagnosis of an infected urachal cyst was confirmed on magnetic resonance scan. He was treated initially with broad spectrum antibiotics in order to allow sepsis to resolve prior to surgical excision of the cyst and fibrous tract. Cystoscopy was performed intraoperatively to exclude sinus communication with the bladder. Histology of the excised specimen showed chronic inflammation with no evidence of malignancy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful."
