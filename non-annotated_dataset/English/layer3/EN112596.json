  "text": "We present a 45-year-old man with arterial hypertension. For year and a half/two years, the patient is on systemic therapy with Aspirin and Irbesartan/Hydrochlorothiazide. The patient also reported about the presence of a pigmented lesion in the abdominal area, which occurred 5-6 years ago, before the onset of cardiac therapy. According to him, there was a change in the colour and size of the lesion within the framework of cardiac therapy (from 1.5-2 years). Innovative one step melanoma surgery was performed, and the lesion was radically removed with a 1 cm operational safety margin in all directions within one operative session. The subsequent histological verification found the presence of thin melanoma."
