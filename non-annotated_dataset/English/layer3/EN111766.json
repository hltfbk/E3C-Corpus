  "text": "A 9-year-old girl complained of severe pain of the right maxillary incisor (tooth 12) when chewing for two weeks. Following clinical and radiographic examinations, Oehlers type III DI of tooth 12, with an immature open apical foramen and a symptomatic periapical pathosis, was diagnosed. Cone-beam computed tomography verified the specific spatial and stereoscopic data regarding the communication between the main root canal and pseudo root canal of the involved tooth. After removing the source of infection, a mineral trioxide aggregate was selected to fill and seal the pseudo root canal; additionally, pulp capping of the main canal was performed through the interconnections between the root canals in the middle segment to preserve pulp vitality and enable continual root formation and eventual root apex closure."
