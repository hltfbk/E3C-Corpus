  "text": "Case 1 was a 71-year-old woman who was treated at our hospital for chronic hepatitis C, nontuberculous mycobacteria infection, and bronchiectasis. She was diagnosed with a stage IV lung adenocarcinoma (cT1bN2M1b) with a synchronous complicating diffuse large B-cell-type lymphoma. Case 2 was a 62-year-old man who had undergone resection of a stage IB lung adenocarcinoma (pT2aN0M0). Thirty months after the surgery, a diffuse large B-cell-type lymphoma was discovered. In both cases, high antiviral capsid antigen IgG antibody titers were observed."
