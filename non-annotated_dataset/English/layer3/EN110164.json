  "text": "A.S 45 year old man with a desmoid tumor right story, recently diagnosed by computed tomographic examination for the occurrence of multiple right renal colic. Physical examination was unremarkable. Renal function was normal and urine culture was negative.\nInitially, a double j stent was performed to compensate for the right ureterohydron√©phrosis. Three months later, surgical removal by median laparotmy was performed. A long portion of the iliolumbar ureter was sclerotic, so we decided to make a ureteral replacement. Technique Isolation of 5 - 7 cm of the terminal ileum on their vascular bed was performed according to the length required to compensate the ureteral defect. Then, according to the Yang-Monti principle, the isolated ileal segment was further subdivided into 2 equal parts (each 2.5 cm in length) with preservation of the individual blood supply. The continuity of the ileum was reestablished. Each ileal segment was incised at its longitudinal axis close to the mesenteric border.\nUnfolding of the incised segments with suturing of their adjacent ends were performed and resulted in the formation of an intestinal plate 2.5 cm wide and 10-12 cm. This plate was tubularized around 16F Nelaton catheter using 4/0 absorbable sutures. Then we realized a spatulisation both proximal and distal ends of the ileum, before establishing a uretero-ileal anastomosis without tension and using two hemi-running 3/0 absorbable sutures. A double j protection stent will be kept for 4 weeks."
