  "text": "We report a case of 10-year-old female with severe genu valgum in EVC using two-step operative technique. First, performing soft tissue release and gradual correction using a TSF. Second, tibia elevation through intra-articular osteotomy resulted in improved joint congruity. At final follow-up, the patient has a good functional result and the Mikulicz line proceeded physiologically to the joint center."
