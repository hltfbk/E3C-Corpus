  "text": "A 15-year-old girl presented to us with the complaints of pain in the left knee of 3months' duration and inability to squat. Radiographic imaging was done which showed lytic lesion involving the proximal tibia and showing cortical destruction. The lesion was graded as a Campanacci Grade 3 tumor. The patient was taken up for surgery and an extended curettage was performed, and the cavity was packed with bone cement. The patient was asymptomatic at the end of 18-month follow-up and was continuing her normal daily activities."
