  "text": "A 24-year-old Chinese woman was transferred to our neurology department with the symptoms of dysarthria and quadriparesis developing one day after the correction of hyponatremia (from 118 mmol/L to 140 mmol/L), which followed with a continuous intravenous drip of pituitrin used to control hemoptysis in the emergency room. During the course, she developed involuntary movement. Magnetic resonance imaging changes were consistent with extrapontine myelinolysis."
