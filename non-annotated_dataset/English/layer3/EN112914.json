  "text": "A 69 year-old caucasian male presented to the chiropractic clinic at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center with complaint of chronic left shoulder pain secondary to an associated full thickness tear of the left infraspinatus. An associated regional assessment of the cervical spine ensued. Radiological imaging on file revealed ankylosis C2/C3 to C7/T1. The patient reported a history of multiple fragment wounds in 1969 to the left anterior neck and shoulder 45 years earlier. Osteomyelitis of the cervical spine resulted from the wounds."
