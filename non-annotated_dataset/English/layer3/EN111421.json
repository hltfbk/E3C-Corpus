  "text": "A 34-year-old woman was referred to our clinic for elevated AST levels with normal levels of other liver-associated enzymes on November 12, 2018. Her AST level of liver function test had been abnormal for 7 mo before she came to the clinic. The patient was asymptomatic with a normal physical examination. There was no relevant family history and no alcohol consumption or smoking. She had a several-month history of traditional Chinese medical taking and had stopped it 1 year prior. The laboratory tests in our clinic showed only the elevation of AST (89.5 U/L) with no other significant abnormalities. We performed the precipitation technique with polyethylene glycol to confirm the presence of macro-AST. Then for almost a year, her AST level still fluctuated in the abnormal range."
