  "text": "We report the case of a 71-year-old male patient diagnosed with BRAF wild-type metastatic melanoma treated with three cycles of ipilimumab, after which he developed grade 3 enteritis. The patient improved on treatment with steroids, and ipilimumab was permanently discontinued at this point. Three years later, the patient's diarrhea returned and colonoscopy revealed active chronic colitis with ulceration resembling inflammatory bowel disease. He was started on Asacol (mesalamine). The patient did not report extraintestinal symptoms typically associated with inflammatory bowel disease, nor did he have a personal or family history of bowel disorders. Moreover, his presentation was not typical of inflammatory bowel disease in the elderly."
