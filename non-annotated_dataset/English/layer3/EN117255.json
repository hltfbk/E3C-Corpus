  "text": "We report the case of a 66-year-old Hispanic man with infective endocarditis complicated by septic emboli in the lumbosacral spine and the left iliopsoas muscle. This disease was caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus containing subpopulations with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. He was initially treated with cephalothin and gentamicin but developed a rash caused by beta-lactams and interstitial nephritis. For that reason, the treatment was subsequently switched to vancomycin but he failed to respond. The infection resolved after administration of vancomycin in combination with gentamicin and rifampin."
