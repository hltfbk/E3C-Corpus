  "text": "A 78-year-old woman was brought to our emergency department by her relatives with an aphasia complaint that had been intermittent for the last 6 hours. The patient's past medical history was unremarkable except hypertension. On original presentation, she was sub febrile with 37,8Â°C, with a blood pressure of 160/80mmHg, pulse of 105 beats/min, respiratory rate of 30 beats/min, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. On her detailed examination, she was well-oriented and cooperated, exhibiting no signs of cranial nerve function disorders, such as facial palsy or dysphagia except disarthri. Her motor strength was normal bilaterally throughout her upper and lower extremities. Distal pulses and sensations were intact in all extremities. No pathological reflexes were found bilaterally. The DTRs were normoactive in all extremities. Her sensory perceptions of touch, vibration and joint position were normal. Cerebellar function tests were negative and there were no signs of ataxia. Her electro cardiogram was noted as sinus tachycardia and right branch block. Laboratory values, including complete blood count, biochemistry and full urinanalysis, were within normal ranges except leukocytosis (WBC: 12.400/mm 3) with neutrophil dominance. Arteriel blood gase analysis revealed that the patient was hypoxic but not hypocarbic (pH 7.41, Paco2 37 mm Hg and Pao2 68 mm Hg, saturation %88 on room air). Brain computerized tomography without contrast revealed chronic atrophic changes. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the patient revealed high intensity signals adjacent to left lateral ventricle without apparent reduced diffusion coefficient in the same location so that this view was thought to be meaningful in terms of sub acute infarction.\nThe patient's dizziness improved in the emergency room. Neurological examination returned to baseline status but sinus tachycardia in her electrocardiogram and low saturation value on room air were continuing. Obtained post ero-anterior pulmonary radiography was unremarkable. An un enhanced CT of chest was planned to patient with a preliminary diagnosis of pneumonia. Un enhanced CT of the chest demonstrate shy perdense material within the right main pulmonary artery. Also the main pulmonary artey and right pulmonary artery were enlarged that is indicative of pulmonary hypertension. Contrast-enhanced CTPA was planned because of seen hyperdense lumen sign and demonstrated hypodense filling defect within the rigth main pulmonary artery consistent with PE. Thrombolytic therapy was not planned because of the patient had sub acute infarct at the same time. The patient who was started anti thrombotic treatment was hospitalized by a pulmonogist."
