  "text": "A 27-year-old female (gravida 2, para 1) suffered with progressive abdomen distention associated with paroxystic pain since 2013. She doesn't consult till june 2014. No history of previous abdominal surgery, intestinal polyposis. Abdominal examination showed a firm nontender intra-abdominal mass, measuring around 10Ã—14 centimeter size, with intrinsic mobility, mass mobile perpendicular to the mesenteric line, all borders were well made out. A clinical diagnosis of mass arising from mesentery was made. Abdomino-pelvic scan showed pelvic lesion tissue adherent to the posterior surface of the wall with the former and underside of the uterus and internal and external iliac vessels (107x161x113 millimiters). Liver function test and renal function test were normal. Elective laparotomy was done showing a giant parietal mass with a huge infiltration of aponevrose which had necessitated a cure plate. Histopathology showed uniform band of spindle shaped cells arranged in fascicles admixed with blood vessels in a collagenous stroma. Cells were infiltrating skeletal muscle without necrosis and mitosis. Postoperative period was uneventful."
