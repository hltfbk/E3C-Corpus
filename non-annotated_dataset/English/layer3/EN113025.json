  "text": "We report a 12-year-old boy, who presented with a hard and large mass in the chest wall. The mass grew slowly after the original resection. Diagnosis and treatment were delayed because of the war. Radiological examination showed a large calcified tumor pushing the upper lung lobe. He was treated surgically. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of an osteochondroma with no evidence of malignancy."
