  "text": "A 30-year-old male presented with a 1-year history of right ankle pain and swelling. He denied any history of recent infection but had had recurrent ankle pain that had been treated accordingly. When he visited our outpatient clinic, he was afebrile. The patient, despite a period of conservative treatment, presented with a localized painful fullness of the ankle. Magnetic resonance imaging helps for the diagnosis with variable specificity, but TB arthritis was diagnosed through a diagnostic arthroscopic procedure, and anti-TB therapy eventually eradicated the infection."
