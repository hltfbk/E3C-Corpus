  "text": "We describe two recent patients encountered, a 64 year old and a 42 year old, who are both severely obese and presented with fluid retention of approximately 40 kilograms. Assessment revealed that the explanation of the gross clinical features were relatively subtle cardiac abnormalities. These cases illustrate how fluid retention in severe obesity can differ from that seen in 'traditional' heart failure in terms of clinical assessment and management."
