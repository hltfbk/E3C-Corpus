  "text": "We report a 75-year-old woman with ovarian carcinoma who presented with fever after chemotherapy. Repeated sterile site cultures remained negative until day 22 of admission, when Lomentospora prolificans was isolated from blood cultures. Following extensive investigations, including Fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and transoephageal echocardiography (TOE), the patient was diagnosed with endocarditis complicated by cerebral emboli. The patient was considered unsuitable for surgical intervention and passed away five days after the fungus was isolated."
