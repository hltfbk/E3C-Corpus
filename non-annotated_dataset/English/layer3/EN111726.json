  "text": "A 47-year-old man presented with a 3-year history of hoarseness, intermittent dyspnea and mass sensation in the neck. The patient was submitted to indirect laryngoscopy; a large submucosal mass obliterating the left side of the supraglottic larynx and partially obstructing the airway was found. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated non-enhancing homogeneous hypodense fat density mass lesion measured 55*45*32 mm, extending through the thyroid membrane to parapharyngeal space and showing extra laryngeal component with an intact laryngeal mucosa lesion. Open surgery of the submucosal mass was performed. Pathology examination confirmed the diagnosis of lipoma."
