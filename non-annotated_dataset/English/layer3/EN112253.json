  "text": "We experienced a 2-year-old girl who developed the signs of encephalopathy with fever 6â€‰months after a spoke-injury. On admission, the injured skin was inflamed with cellulitis. The blood culture was positive for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Electroencephalogram showed diffuse slow-wave activity. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging detected a high-intensity lesion with decreased diffusivity at the right frontal cortex. She received immunoglobulin and combined antibiotics treatments in the intensive care unit, and successfully overcame the sepsis-associated encephalopathy without neurological impairments."
