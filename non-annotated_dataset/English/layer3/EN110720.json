  "text": "This case series describes 4 patients with 4 mucosal neoplasms located in the pyloric ring. The diameter of each neoplasm was less than 15 mm. We performed UEMR for the lesions. Water immersion enabled slight floating of the lesions, resulting in easy identification. We achieved en bloc resection with a snare and electrosurgical unit. All procedure were performed within 3 min without adverse events. Pathologic examination showed low-grade dysplasia with clear resection margins in one case and hyperplastic polyps in three cases."
