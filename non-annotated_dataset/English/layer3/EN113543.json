  "text": "We have assessed one consanguineous Saudi family with typical features of VDEGS. Two siblings were affected with almost identical features; including blepharophimosis, arachnodactyly, flexion contractures of the elbows, camptodactyly, slender ribs, hooked lateral clavicular ends, and bilateral radial head dislocations. Both patients had several unusual features; including joint laxity, flat feet, recurrent patellar dislocations, and bilateral short distal ulnae. Full sequencing of SCARF2 revealed a homozygous mutation c.773G > A (p. Cys258Tyr) in both affected children. The parents (both with no abnormalities) were heterozygous for the same mutation."
