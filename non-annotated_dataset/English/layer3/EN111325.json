  "text": "A previously healthy 55-year-old man presented to the local hospital 18 h after a hump-nosed viper bite. He developed bilateral severe pulmonary haemorrhages, evidenced by rapid desaturation which needed intubation and mechanical ventilation, bleeding from the endotracheal tube and bilateral alveolar shadows in a chest x-ray. He had no other bleeding manifestations. Because of the life-threatening situation, he was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy. There was a rapid improvement of hypoxia with a resolution of x-ray changes. He was successfully weaned off from the ventilation after 24 h."
