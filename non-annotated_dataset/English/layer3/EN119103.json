  "text": "Here, we reported a 54-year-old man with an indolent clinical course of HCC. He had multiple extra-hepatic recurrences after initial hepatectomy for HCC and was benefited from repeated resections with prolonged survival. Eventually, he developed intramuscular recurrence in the thigh, which was initially mistaken as deep vein thrombosis."
