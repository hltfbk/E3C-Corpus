  "text": "We report the case of a patient with late-onset spinal form CTX without brain lesion. He showed pyramidal tract signs, and impaired joint position and vibration sensation in the lower limbs. Cervical sagittal MRI demonstrated a longitudinally extensive white matter abnormality in the dorsal column of the C2-C7 spinal cord; however, a brain MRI revealed an absence of lesions, including in the cerebellar white matter. Genetic analysis of CYP27A1 revealed that the patient was compound heterozygous for p.Gln85Arg in exon 1, a novel mutation, and p.Arg405Gln in exon 7, a previously reported mutation."
