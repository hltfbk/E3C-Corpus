  "text": "A 60-year-old female experienced sudden back pain combined with numbness and weakness in the lower limbs for several hours with no trauma, drug use, family history or any disease history. Her deep tendon reflexes were normoactive, and Babinski was negative. An emergent MRI showed a spinal epidural hematoma extending from T3 to T5. She was taken to surgery after immediate clinical and laboratory evaluations had been completed. Emergency decompression with laminectomy was performed and the patient recovered immediately after the surgery. Additional history taken from the patient at outpatient clinic after discharge revealed that she had been continuously taking herbal medicine containing black garlic for 8Â weeks."
