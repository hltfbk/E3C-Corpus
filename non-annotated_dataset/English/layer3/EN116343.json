  "text": "A 48 year old male presented to our emergency department with pain and restriction of movements involving both shoulders following a fall. The patient was standing by the side of a two wheeler when he had a sudden syncopal attack and toppled on the other side of the vehicle. On examination there was flattening of deltoid contour with a positive Dugas test in both sides. Humeral head was palpable posteriorly on the right side and anteriorly on the left side. Plain radiograph anteroposterior view of both shoulders showed posterior dislocation of right shoulder with a fracture of greater tuberosity and anterior dislocation of left shoulder with a greater tuberosity fracture. Closed reduction was achieved for both shoulders under general anaesthesia. After a couple of weeks, complete range of motion exercises was started. X-ray of bilateral shoulders, at 3 months, showed complete union of the fracture."
