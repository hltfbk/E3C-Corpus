  "text": "A healthy 32-year-old national level power lifter presented with an isolated avulsion of the vastus lateralis tendon. After a failed course of conservative therapy he underwent surgical repair and a graded physical therapy programme. One year later he returned to full training with no evidence of re-rupture."
