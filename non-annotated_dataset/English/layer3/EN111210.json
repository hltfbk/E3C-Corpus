  "text": "This retrospective review identified 5 patients, who were HBV carriers positive for hepatitis B surface antigen among 1352 patients with surgically treated hypothalamic/pituitary tumor in Kohnan Hospital between February 2007 and April 2017. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed with particular attention to prevent damage to the pituitary gland, with delicate manipulation to minimize postoperative steroid coverage. All patients received nucleot(s)ide analogue to control HBV-DNA levels before the surgery. As a result, all patients had a good clinical course. Blood examinations found a transient increase of liver enzymes and HBV-DNA levels in all patients, which started to decrease within 2â€‰weeks after surgery. No specific treatment other than nucleot(s)ide analogues was needed to maintain liver function, and all patients returned to their previous activities including reinstatement."
