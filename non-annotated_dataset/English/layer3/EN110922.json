  "text": "We report a rare case of a 13-year-old boy with primary synovial chondromatosis of the subscapular bursa. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed that multiple cartilaginous loose bodies were found in the subscapular bursa and the glenohumeral joint. Arthroscopic removal of loose bodies and synovectomy of the subscapular bursa was performed through sublabral foramen."
