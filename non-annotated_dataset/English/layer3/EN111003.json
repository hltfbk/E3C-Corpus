  "text": "A patient with stage IV refractory and relapsed diffuse large B cell lymphoma was treated with regional and intravenous CAR-T cells. During the observation period, the temperature of the skin at the abdominal wall mass was slightly elevated, and tolerable pain in the injection area was reported. Imaging showed regional liquefactive necrosis. After the sequential administration of ibrutinib and venetoclax, the abdominal wall mass significantly decreased in size."
