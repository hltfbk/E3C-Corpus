  "text": "In February 2018, a 72-year-old Japanese man presented with eruption without pain on his right shoulder. As an itching sensation and pain gradually emerged, he visited the clinic10days after the initial appearance of the eruption. He was diagnosed with lumbar spinal canal stenosis, in 2014, and had been prescribed a combination of tramadol, acetaminophen, and pregabalin for pain relief. He was diagnosed with herpes zoster infection, and valacyclovir was prescribed for 7 days. His symptoms were relieved on the 10thdayafter the initial presentation."
