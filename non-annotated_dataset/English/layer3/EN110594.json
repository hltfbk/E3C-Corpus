  "text": "We present the case of a 37-year-old man who presented with ongoing pain on weight-bearing and swelling in the left Achilles tendon area8 months after acute rupture treated with functional bracing and early rehabilitation. Magnetic resonance imaging showed intrasubstance thickening of the tendon with a large swelling. Successful decompression of the swelling was achieved using an arthroscopic technique and the patient returned to normal activities."
