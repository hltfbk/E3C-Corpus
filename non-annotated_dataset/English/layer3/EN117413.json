  "text": "A 58-year-old Caucasian man had a mass 30 mm in size in the head of the pancreas and obstructive jaundice. He was referred for radiological insertion of plastic biliary stents after a failed endoscopic attempt. The procedure was uneventful, and the patient was discharged. Two weeks after the procedure, the patient presented with an acute abdomen and signs of sepsis. Computed tomography revealed erosion of the posterior duodenal wall from the plastic stent, and a large retroperitoneal abscess. The abscess was drained under computed tomography guidance, and the migrated stent was removed percutaneously with a snare under fluoroscopic guidance. Our patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged after a week."
