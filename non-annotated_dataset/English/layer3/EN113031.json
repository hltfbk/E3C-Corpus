  "text": "A 47-year-old male patient was admitted with extensive perineum fascia necrosis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that rapidly spread to near the anus. After comprehensive therapy completed wound bed preparation, STSGs from the scalp were grafted to the wound, and NPWT was applied to improve STSGs survival and seal the anus without faecal diversion. After treatment, graft take was 95%, and the exposed testicular and residual wounds were repaired with a local skin flap. At discharge, the wound had decreased to two pea-sized areas. The patient received conventional moist gauze therapy to close the residual wound at the local hospital. A follow-up by telephone 1Â month later showed that both wounds had healed and that the patient was satisfied with the outcome."
