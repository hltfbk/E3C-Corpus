  "text": "A 18-year-old male was referred to our outpatient clinic because of mass-like lesion in his left calf. He had a history of car accident and left isolated tibia fracture 30 months ago that was treated by open reduction and internal fixation with DCP plate. After union in radiograph, the plate was removed 7 months ago on the patient request. Four weeks after surgery, the patient had complaints of pain and swelling. Finally, pseudoaneurysm was diagnosed and was repaired in a common surgery with a vascular surgeon without any difficulty."
