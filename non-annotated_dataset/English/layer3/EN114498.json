  "text": "We describe a 62-year old patient diagnosed with malignant pleural mesothelioma who experienced ten days after the second dose of third line therapy with pembrolizumab sudden onset of generalized edema including legs and eyelids and weight gain of 15 kg resulting from nephrotic syndrome and acute renal failure. Pembrolizumab was discontinued and prednisone, diuretics and angiotensin II receptor blocker were initiated with full recovery of symptoms and renal function. Pembrolizumab-associated minimal change disease (MCD) was confirmed by electron microscopy in the renal biopsy."
