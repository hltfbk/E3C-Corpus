  "text": "Here we report for the first time a case of a recall reaction to Eribulin mesylate, a novel chemotherapeutic compound that affects microtubule polymerisation, approved for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced breast cancers (BCs). We present the case of a 61-year-old female BC patient originally diagnosed with bilateral BC with metastatic disease that went through several lines of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT); RR reaction was observed following Eribulin treatment and sequential palliative RT."
