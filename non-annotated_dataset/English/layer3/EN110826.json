  "text": "We report on a 13-year old male who presented with an afebrile convulsion with a background history of chronic burning sensation of hands and feet and anhidrosis for 2 years duration with a similar history of episodic acroparesthesia in the other male sibling. The early clinical diagnosis was based on the history and detection of Cornea Verticillata on eye examination. Biochemical confirmation was established with detection of low α galactosidase A enzyme levels and a missense mutation of the Galactosidase Alpha (GLA) Gene (c.136C > T) established the genetic confirmation."
