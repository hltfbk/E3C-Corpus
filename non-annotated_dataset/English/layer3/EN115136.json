  "text": "We describe 2 female patients in their 20s confirmed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. They shared two points in common: About several weeks (2 weeks and 5 weeks respectively) before the initial symptom, both of them underwent a resection of melanocytic nevi; the screening tests for an ovarian teratoma and other tumors were all negative. A 25 year-old woman presented with seizure, psychiatric symptoms and behavioral change for 2 weeks. Electroencephalogram indicated electrographic seizures. Anti-NMDAR antibodies were all positive in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Her symptoms relieved gradually after the treatment with steroids and mycophenolate mofetil. Another patient admitted to our hospital with psychosis, behavioral change and complex partial seizure over a period of 5 months. Electroencephalogram demonstrated generalized slow activities. High titres of anti-NMDAR antibodies were both detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. She responded well to the first-line immunotherapy and got substantial recovery."
