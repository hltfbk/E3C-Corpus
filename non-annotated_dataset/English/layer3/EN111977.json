  "text": "We present the case of a giant fibroepithelial polyp measuring approximately 11 x 6 x 4 cm which was protruding from the anterior lip of the uterine cervix in a 51-year-old woman who clinically presented vaginal bleeding. She was nulligravida and doesn't have a child. The speculum examination revealed a soft, mobile, painless irregular cerebriform mass on the cervix, protruding through the vagina. The polyp was excised using a scalpel, and the pedicle was sutured using the Vicryl 1-0 under short-term intravenous anaesthesia. Histopathological examination revealed a polypoidal tumour mass composed of cellular fibrovascular stroma covered with stratified squamous epithelium. Three months after the initial surgery, there was no recurrence seen."
