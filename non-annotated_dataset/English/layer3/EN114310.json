  "text": "A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for comprehensive investigation of nephrotic syndrome. Computed tomography showed a small nodule in the right upper lung lobe with hilar mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Pathological examination of transbronchial biopsy samples of the nodule yielded a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, the pathological detection of amyloid deposition in biopsy samples of a subcarinal lymph node, gastric and duodenal mucosa, cardiac muscle, and bone marrow led to a diagnosis of primary systemic AL amyloidosis with nephrotic syndrome and cardiomyopathy. In addition, RAGE was detected in lung tumour tissues surrounded by normal lung tissues with amyloid deposition."
