  "text": "Three PD patients scheduled for DBS surgery had to receive general anesthesia for various reasons. For the first asleep stage, general anesthesia and nasotracheal intubation was completed with routine methods. During the awake stage, we pulled the nasotracheal tube back right above the epiglottis under fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) guidance for microelectrode recording (MER), macrostimulation testing and verbal communication. Once monitoring is completed, we induced anesthesia with rapid sequence induction and utilized the FOB to advance the nasotracheal tube into the trachea again. To minimize airway irritations during the process, we sprayed the airway with lidocaine before any manipulation. The neurophysiologists completed neuromoinitroing successfully and all three patients were satisfied with the anesthesia provided at follow-up."
