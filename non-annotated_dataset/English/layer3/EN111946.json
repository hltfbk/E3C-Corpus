  "text": "A 76-year-old woman presented a 5-mo history of exertional angina. Selective coronary angiography revealed an SCA, with severe ostial stenosis that originated from the left sinus of Valsalva and bifurcated normally into the LAD and circumflex coronary artery. In addition, an anomalous RCA originated from the mid segment of the LAD as a separate branch. Successful balloon angioplasty and stenting for the SCA ostial stenosis were performed on the patient."
