  "text": "A 40-year-old male presented with Achilles tendon contracture and muscle weakness that bothered him from 8â€‰years old. While the strength of his distal and proximal upper limbs was severely impaired, the function of his lower limbs was relatively spared. Muscle pathology showed dystrophic features, and electron microscopy showed ultrastructural abnormalities of disrupted muscle nuclei envelopes. Whole-exome sequencing showed a frameshift mutation in TOR1AIP1 (c.98dupC)."
