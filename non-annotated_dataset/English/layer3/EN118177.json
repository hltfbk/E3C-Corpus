  "text": "A 32-year-old woman (gravida 2, para 1) presented with massive vaginal bleeding. A Cesarean scar pregnancy was diagnosed. She was treated by local methotrexate injection, followed by uterine artery embolization. Recurrence of bleeding necessitated two repeat embolizations. Hysteroscopy four months later revealed the presence of a uterine defect within the Cesarean section scar."
