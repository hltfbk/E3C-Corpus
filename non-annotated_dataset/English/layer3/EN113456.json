  "text": "Hereinafter we describe a case of an immunocompetent 56 years old woman, presenting with flank pain and shivering. The diagnosis turned out to be difficult due to initially negative urine culture. The fungaemia caused by obstructive nephropathy led to bilateral candida chorioretinitis. The patient was treated with intravenous amphotericin b and the bezoar was removed by percutaneous \"nephrolitholapaxy\". After two months, a follow up revealed the patient felt well, chorioretinal lesions regressed and urine culture did not show any fungal growth."
