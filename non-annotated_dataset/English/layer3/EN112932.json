  "text": "A 13-year-old female presented with a growing left-sided tongue mass. The patient has a past medical history of NF2. The tongue mass was excised and histopathological examination revealed a spindle cell tumor with multinodular growth pattern, with Verocay bodies' formation. Tumor cells were strongly positive for S-100 protein and negative for smooth muscle actin (SMA), and EMA highlighted perineural fibroblasts surrounding tumor nodules. These findings were diagnostic of plexiform schwannoma."
