  "text": "Three Caucasian patients, two men (21 and 24 years of age) and one woman (14 years of age), with bronchial masses were evaluated by us. All three patients were symptomatic, and underwent a thorough clinical examination, bronchoscopy and biopsy, plain computed tomography, 18F-FDG PET-CT and 68Gallium 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-NI,NII,NIII,NIIII,- tetra acetic acid (D) - Phel1-Tyr3-octreotide positron emission tomography-computed tomography (68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT). 18F-FDG PET-CT revealed mild uptake in all three patients, whereas 68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT revealed no significant uptake in any patient, making carcinoid tumor unlikely. Results of histopathological examination were consistent with low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma in all patients."
