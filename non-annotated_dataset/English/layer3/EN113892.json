  "text": "We are presenting a case report of a 30-year-old male, who had previously underwent an above-knee amputation due to road-traffic accident, presenting 24 h after the injury with segmental fracture femur and popliteal artery laceration, for which the limb could not be salvaged. He had an impacted anteroinferior dislocation of the ipsilateral hip with significant cartilage damage of the femoral head which required open reduction. Subsequently, he developed traumatic arthritis of the involved hip which required conversion to an uncemented THR, using a minimally invasive (MIS) anterolateral approach. The preoperative management, surgical technique, and postoperative rehabilitation are described to highlight the technical challenges, these lower limb amputees may present along with review of literature of such rare cases."
