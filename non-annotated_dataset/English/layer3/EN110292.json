  "text": "A 24-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 3, asthmatic for 13 years and diabetic with high dose of insulin for 2 years. The current unplanned pregnancy was poorly followed. The first ultrasound was performed at 28 weeks of gestation. It revealed an anterior medial mass of the anterior abdominal wall, well limited, surrounded by a thin membrane where passes the umbilical vein. It was an omphalocele containing small intestine with a collar measuring 1.5 cm. The insertion of the umbilical cord on the top of the omphalic sac was thick in relation to an over-developed Wharton's jelly. It was associated with a short rachis limited only to the thoracic stage. Indeed, there was an agenesis of lumbar vertebrae, sacral and coccygeal on the axial and sagittal sections. The lower limbs were frozen, of echo structure distinctly different from that of the upper limbs with bone segments little echogenic. The long bones (femurs and humerus) were shortened. The femur measured 3.92 cm and the humerus was 3.52 cm corresponding to an ultrasound term of 22 weeks of gestation. There was also a moderate ventriculomegaly, measured at 12 mm. A fetal MRI was then performed. Its objective was to study the spine and the spinal cord and to seek an etiology for ventriculomegaly. It confirmed the omphalocele and its content. It allowed a more precise spinal analysis by showing an interruption of the spine with agenesis of the lumbar, sacral and coccygeal segments. The medullary cord was visible until the end of the spine. The delivery was performed by Caesarean section at 40 weeks of gestation for breech presentation. The newborn, male, was hospitalized in neonatal resuscitation because of neonatal respiratory distress associated with a malformative syndrome. His Apgar was five in the first minute and then seven in the fifth minute. The clinical examination found a weight at 3600 g, a small size at 36 cm, and a macrocrania with a cranial perimeter at 38 cm. The omphalocele was found to be 10 cm in diameter. There was also a micromyelia of the two lower limbs, feet bots, paraplegia of the two lower limbs and peripheral axial hypotonia, a polypnea at 80 cycles/min and a generalized cyanosis. Cardiac auscultation was normal. The thoraco-abdominal radiograph showed cardiomegaly, digestive clarity in the omphalocele and lumbo-sacrococcygeal agenesis. The karyotype was normal (46, XY). The evolution was marked by the death after five hour of life by neonatal respiratory distress."
