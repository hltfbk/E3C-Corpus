  "text": "A 49-year-old female presented with bilateral lower limb erythematous bullous rash with bilateral lower limb numbness. She had bilateral ankle edema with frothyuria and a recent onset wheeze. Blood investigations revealed a marked peripheral eosinophilia with positive P-ANCA. Skin biopsy was suggestive of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. She also had positive cryoglobulins with a high rheumatoid factor titre. The patient was diagnosed of having EGPA with overlapping mixed essential cryoglobulinemia. Her skin eruptions and systemic manifestations improved with prednisolone and cyclophosphamide therapy."
