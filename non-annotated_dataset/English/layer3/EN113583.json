  "text": "A 23Â year-old female with history of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) and HCM presented for evaluation after an episode of Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). The patient was found to have severe coronary bridging on angiography and underwent an unroofing of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Due to the constellation of symptoms, the patient underwent genetic testing and a cardiac muscle biopsy. Genetic testing was significant for an Arg302Gln mutation in the PRKAG2 gene. Cardiac tissue biopsy revealed significant myocyte hypertrophy and large vacuoles with glycogen stores."
