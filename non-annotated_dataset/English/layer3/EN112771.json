  "text": "We present a series of four cases which were misdiagnosed by the treating surgeons, reporting radiologists and pathologists due to clinical and investigatory consistencies with other benign or malignant orthopedic tumors. Due to common diagnostic errors of these uncommon tumors, the patients had recurrence and required multiple invasive procedures which could have been avoided with high index of suspicion."
