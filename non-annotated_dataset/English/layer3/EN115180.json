  "text": "All three patients had a history of ocular trauma, and their clinical symptoms were compatible with the persistence of IOFBs. It was difficult to get a direct visualization of IOFBs with slit-lamp biomicroscopy because of opacities of the cornea and traumatic cataract. A computed tomography scan detected IOFBs in the anterior segment, but could not determine the exact location. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was performed but failed to show any IOFBs owing to the limited depth of penetration. B-scan ultrasonography was further applied but also failed to show any intraocular foreign bodies using axial scanning, a routine procedure of B-scan ultrasonography examination. However, using dynamic transversal scanning of B-scan ultrasonography, the accurate location of IOFBs was eventually shown to be embedded in the posterior lens cortex in case 1, adjacent to the posterior lens capsule in case 2, and located in the anterior vitreous close to the posterior lens capsule in case 3. Different surgical procedures were designed according to localization by B-scan ultrasonography, and all IOFBs were successfully removed."
