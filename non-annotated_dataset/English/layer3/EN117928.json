  "text": "A 67 years old Caucasian woman presented with three days history of right flank pain and difficulty in urination. Her medical history included cervical cautery due to ectropion 15 years previously. In physical exam a huge cystic mass that proved to be a large hematocervix was bulging in the vagina. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a distended cervix adjacent to distended urinary bladder secondary to endometrial cancer."
