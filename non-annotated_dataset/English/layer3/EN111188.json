  "text": "We present a very rare case of an adult male with a sino-nasal mass diagnosed to be an embryonal type rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient also had a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma-tongue for the past 8 months. Radiological investigations were done to see the extent of the sino-nasal mass and the extent of tongue lesion, which was seen to be involving the base of the tongue. The patient was referred for chemoradiotherapy but succumbed to the disease after 2 weeks of treatment."
