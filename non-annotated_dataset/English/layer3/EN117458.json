  "text": "We report the case of a 16-year-old Caucasian girl who had undergone resection of a retroperitoneal paraganglioma that measured 15 × 11.5 × 9.5 cm. After further staging, a solitary metastatic paraganglioma was detected in the first lumbar vertebral body. After initial chemotherapy, marginal en bloc resection and reconstruction were performed followed by radiotherapy. Histologic examination of the specimen revealed that the tumor cells did not show any response to preoperative chemotherapy, which is in line with a few other reports in the literature. Ten years after operative treatment, the patient is free of complaints, very satisfied with the result and without signs of local recurrence or distant metastases."
