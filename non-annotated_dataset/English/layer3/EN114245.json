  "text": "A 28 year old female Cameroonian presented with progressive burning painful sensations on the upper trunk, paraesthesia and numbness of the upper and lower limbs for a period of 5 years. Before presenting to us, she had consulted in numerous health institutions for which she had been treated for diverse pathologies with no relieve of symptoms. After clinical and laboratory evaluation, a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency-associated neuropathy was made. She was placed on oral vitamin B12 supplements at 2 mg daily for 3 months. Follow up was marked by good clinical recovery after 1 month of therapy."
