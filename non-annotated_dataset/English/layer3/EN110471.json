  "text": "A 63-year-old man presented with a one-year history of progressive and itchy perineal lesions. On physical examination, the patient had extensive verrucous plaques and nodules of the gluteal region, perineum extending to the inner thighs. Skin biopsy showed multiple small, non-necrotizing, epithelioid cell granulomas in the dermis with hyperkeratosis and acanthosis of the underling epidermis. Special stains and culture of skin tissue failed to indicate any infectious diseases. PCR analyses from skin biopsy failed to detect mycobacterial DNA. Blood investigations showed lymphopenia and elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels. Endoscopic screening for inflammatory bowel disease was normal. Systemic computed tomography identified hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes associated with subpleural and peri-lymphatic micronodules. Based on the histopathology, radiological findings and the exclusion of other granulomatous etiologies, a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made. The patient was managed with topical and general steroids."
