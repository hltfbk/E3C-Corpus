  "text": "We present a 24-year-old man with erosions and ulcerations on palatal mucosa and a strawberry-like gingival hypertrophy associated with nasal congestion and epistaxis which two stated months ago. Also he had an episode of unilateral blepharitis and upper eyelid edema five months ago. Mucosal biopsy showed perivascular infiltrations of mainly neutrophils, some eosinophils and rare giant cells. He had elevated level of proteinase 3-ANCA or C-ANCA with microscopic hematuria without significant kidney involvement in kidney biopsy. Mucosal lesions and hematuria improved after two months of treatment with oral prednisolone."
