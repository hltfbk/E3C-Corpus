  "text": "We present a case of a 35-year-old woman presenting with progressive numbness and weakness in the legs and urinary incontinence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intramedullary lesion with bright enhancement. A diagnosis of spinal hemangioblastoma was suspected, and thus a three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography reconstruction was requested, which also demonstrated an angiomatous lesion. The tumor was completely resected under neurophysiological monitoring. However, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed an SFT. No adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy was scheduled. The symptoms were relieved completely, and no recurrence or progression was noted during the follow-up."
