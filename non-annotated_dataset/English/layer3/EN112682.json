  "text": "We report a 1-year-old child with no obvious history of trauma who presented with conscious disturbance. Abdominal computed tomography showed acute ischemic bowel complicated with pneumatosis intestinalis and portomesenteric venous gas. The first impression was septic shock with acute ischemic bowel. Two weeks after admission, brain magnetic resonance imaging showed subdural hemorrhage of different stages over bilateral fronto-parietal convexities and diffuse axonal injury, suggesting abusive head trauma. He was subsequently diagnosed with occult child abuse."
