  "text": "Four patients with OLTs who had continued symptoms after PJCAT underwent a second-look arthroscopic evaluation. The quality of cartilage repair was evaluated using the international cartilage repair society (ICRS) score. Biopsy of the repair was taken for histological analysis. Two patients demonstrated a lack of integration of the allograft into the surrounding cartilage, and two had failures associated with impingement. Three patients' repairs were consistent with a Grade III ICRS score and one with a Grade II score. Histological examination demonstrated fibrotic repair tissue (Type 1 collagen) with depleted proteoglycans and Type II collagen."
