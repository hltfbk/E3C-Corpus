  "text": "A 77-year-old man underwent pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy for suspected distal bile duct cancer. Hemorrhage from a pseudoaneurysm of the common hepatic artery due to the formation of the pancreatic fistula was detected on postoperative day 9, and a stent graft was successfully placed with the preservation of hepatic arterial blood flow. On postoperative day 12, new-onset hemorrhage from a pseudoaneurysm of the right hepatic artery developed, and a stent graft was similarly placed, but immediately occluded. Refractory pancreatic and biliary fistulas developed and required continuous drainage. On postoperative day 85, computed tomography revealed the presence of air within the latter stent graft, which indicated infection of the stent graft. The patient died due to sepsis caused by the graft infection."
