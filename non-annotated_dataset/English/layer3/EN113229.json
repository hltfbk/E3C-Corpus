  "text": "A 52-year-old colon cancer female was brought to us with a family history of colon cancer. Genetic counseling traced 4 members in her family with colon cancer (mother and 3 siblings including the proband) as well as other cancer types. Next generation sequencing (NGS) with a multiple gene panel including MMR genes showed a germline mutation in MLH1 (c.1852_1854delAAG, p.K618del) in all 3 affected family members and confirmed the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. In addition, this mutation was also identified in a asymptomatic offspring, who was then recommended to a prophylactic measure against cancer. A personalized health care plan was implemented for monitoring the condition and progression of the affected individuals."
