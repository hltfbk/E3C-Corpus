  "text": "We present the case of a patient with metastatic prostate cancer and chronic kidney disease due to obstructive nephropathy who developed severe hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia after denosumab injection, which required intensive care unit admission, aggressive calcium supplementation, and hemodialysis assistance. We reviewed the evidence behind the safety profile of denosumab in chronic kidney disease, and we also looked at additional factors that may precipitate severe hypocalcemia with denosumab in advanced kidney disease."
