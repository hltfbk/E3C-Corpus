  "text": "A 66-year-old Japanease man presented eye closure myotonia, percussion myotonia and grip myotonia together with the warm-up phenomenon and cold aggravation from early childhood. On genetic analysis, a heterozygous mutation of the SCN4A gene (c.2065 C > T, p.L689F), with no mutation of the CLCN1, DMPK, or ZNF9/CNBP gene, was detected. He was diagnosed as having NDMs. A biopsy of the biceps brachii muscle showed increasing fiber size variation, internal nuclei, chained nuclei, necrotic fibers, fiber splitting, endomysial fibrosis, pyknotic nuclear clumps and disorganized intermyofibrillar networks. Sarcoplasmic masses, tubular aggregates and ragged-red fibers were absent."
