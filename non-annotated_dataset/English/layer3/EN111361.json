  "text": "A 38 year old female presented with a large 8.0â€‰cm enhancing left adrenal mass concerning for pheochromocytoma, given refractory hypertension and symptoms of palpitations and headaches. Functional work up was negative. The patient underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic left adrenalectomy after appropriate alpha and beta blockade. Histological sections demonstrated a cortical neoplasm with prominent myxoid changes consistent with myxoid adrenocortical carcinoma. The patient's symptoms resolved and serial imaging demonstrated no recurrence three and nine months, post-operatively."
