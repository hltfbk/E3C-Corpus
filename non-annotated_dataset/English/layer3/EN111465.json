  "text": "The patient was diagnosed with oophoritis when she was 8 years of age. She had no menses before treatment. The patient underwent a low-dose contraceptive treatment from age 19 until she was 31 years of age. During this period, the size of her uterus was constantly monitored, which revealed constant yet slow uterine growth. At age 31, Drospil (containing 3 mg of drospirenone and 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol) treatment was initiated and administered for 3 months, which led to substantial uterine growth and menses. After her uterus had reached a mature size, the patient was referred to an assisted reproductive technology clinic. There she received a donor oocyte that was fertilized with the sperm of her husband. She had a successful low-risk pregnancy after the second embryo transfer."
