  "text": "We report the case of an 8-year-old girl with an epiphyseal distal fibula fracture complicated with a symptomatic non-union associated with the chondral flap of the talar dome after conservative treatment. Surgical excision of the fragment and chondroplasty was performed and resulted in an excellent clinical outcome."
