  "text": "We report a 28-year-old Pakistani male complaining of recurrent migraines that are now associated with skin markings that appear on his forehead and last for a few days and then disappear on their own. A diagnosis of migraines with cutaneous markings was made. An MRI was done on the patient and showed normal results. The patient has only been given painkillers for the treatment of his migraines. No other treatment or interventions have been done."
