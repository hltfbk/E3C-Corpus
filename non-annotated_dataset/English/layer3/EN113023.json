  "text": "A 19y old male with relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was admitted under haematology with pyrexia of unknown origin. At the time of his admission, he reported bilateral and sequential visual impairment for 2 days. On examination, there was bilateral profound retinopathy across the posterior poles. This was symmetrical and with associated macular oedema. Infective aetiology was excluded and cyclosporine was stopped. Although no definitive treatment was initiated the visual acuity improved whilst macular oedema fluctuated."
