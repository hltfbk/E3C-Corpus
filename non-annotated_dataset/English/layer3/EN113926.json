  "text": "We report a case of life-threatening bleeding from DL during late pregnancy 31 weeks. Hemoclips were used twice through upper endoscopy with successful hemostasis. Unfortunately, she developed HELLP syndrome diagnosed 5 days after the GI bleeding was stopped. Her pregnancy had to be terminated with delivery of a premature infant. She recovered from her illness and discharged from hospital uneventfully. There is no current report in literature of DL in pregnant woman subsequently suffered HELLP syndrome."
