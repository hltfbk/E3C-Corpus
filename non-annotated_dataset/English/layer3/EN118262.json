  "text": "We report a case of a 24-year-old primigravida of Indian origin who was seen in the emergency department with a diagnosis of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. A careful ultrasound assessment led to the diagnosis of a heterotopic pregnancy. Immediate surgical intervention with supportive measures resulted in a successful outcome."
