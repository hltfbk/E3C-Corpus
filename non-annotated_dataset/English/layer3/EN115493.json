  "text": "Review of recent literature and presentation of a patient with Morgagni defect. Only five cases of simultaneous Morgagni hernia and paraesophageal hernia have been described in the English-language literature since 1958. Here, we report the first case of acute appendicitis within an incarcerated right Morgagni hernia in a 76-year-old patient who also had a paraesophageal hernia."
