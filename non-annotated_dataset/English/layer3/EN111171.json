  "text": "A 61-year-old woman had been operated with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and hiatoplasty. A few weeks later she presented with high-output chyloperitoneum due to large leakage of the proximal thoracic duct. Conservative treatment and conventional transnodal lymphangiography did not result in a significant improvement. Thoracic duct embolization via retrograde transvenous access was challenging but both technically and clinically successful."
