  "text": "We report the case of a 79-year-old Korean woman with a gastric subepithelial lesion in the stomach body. The lesion was observed via endoscopy as a bulging mass in the stomach body with a cystic center. It was confirmed via endoscopic ultrasonography. A laparoscopic wedge resection was performed. A biopsy revealed epithelial and smooth muscle proliferation, and a final diagnosis of gastric adenomyoma was made."
