  "text": "This is a case of asymptomatic giant right coronary artery aneurysm concurrent with coronary artery fistula. Because the aneurysm was in the distal right posterior descending coronary artery, right coronary artery ligation and fistula occlusion through the right atrium were performed in the absence of cardiopulmonary bypass. The aneurysm was excluded without impacting the myocardial blood supply, and the patient was exempted from lifelong anticoagulation regimen. The follow-up revealed favorable outcomes and the patient's life expectancy was improved."
