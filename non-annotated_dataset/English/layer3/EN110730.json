  "text": "A 79-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with Barrett's esophageal cancer and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Initially, we performed endoscopic submucosal dissection for Barrett's esophageal cancer. Since residual tumor was observed after the endoscopic submucosal dissection, we performed an esophagectomy with two-field lymph node dissection, which was followed by placement of a gastric conduit via the posterior mediastinal route. He was discharged 14â€‰days after surgery. Although no additional treatment exists for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, no recurrent disease has been detected to date."
