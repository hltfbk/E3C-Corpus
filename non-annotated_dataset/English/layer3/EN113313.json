  "text": "We report here a new case due to Neisseria meningitidis occurring in an 85 year-old-man. The comparison with previous reports allows to drawn several conclusions: (i) cases occurred in relatively old adults (median age: 65 years); (ii) Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. meningitiditis and Staphylococcus aureus are the leading responsible pathogens; (iii) atypical clinical presentation seems the rule in which meningism often lacks; (iv) in absence of clinical or biological specific parameters, modern brain imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement is of utmost importance for the diagnosis, leading to anticipate an increase of the diagnosis in the near future, thanks to easier access to such exploration; (v) death or serious sequelae commonly occurred; (vi) prolonged antibiotic courses (6 weeks to 3 months) have been used, without strong rational. In the given case, the patient presented with a lack of meningeal irritation signs. The diagnosis was made by MRI considering a lasting confused state. A four-week antibiotic regimen was successful, combining two weeks of intravenous cefotaxime followed by two weeks of oral levofloxacin much easier to administrate and allowing early rehabilitation."
