  "text": "A 6 years old boy with IgA nephropathy presented with dyspnea, orthopnea, pretibial pitting edema, ascites and fever. Muffled heart sounds and hepatomegaly were also noted. Echocardiography and thoracic CT revealed that there was a large volume of hydropericardium. Moreover, the pericardial milky fluid by pericardiocentesis was analyzed and chylopericardium effusion was eventually confirmed. Pericardial drainage was continued and his diet was modified to low fat, rich MCT and high protein. Complete remission was achieved after 3 weeks of this combined treatment."
