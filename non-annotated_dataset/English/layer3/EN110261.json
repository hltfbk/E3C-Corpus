  "text": "A 60-year-old male presented with back pain and lower extremity weakness. He had diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and four lumbar disc hernia. He had been taking antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs for 5 years, together with anti-inflammatory agents for 1 month. He had a heart rate of 70 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, a fingertip blood sugar of 173 mg/dl, and an oxygen saturation (SpO 2) of 99%. His electrocardiography (ECG) revealed a normal sinus rhythm. Laboratory analyses revealed that his blood electrolytes were normal. When he was observed in the emergency department, his consciousness and orientation were deteriorated. His vital signs changed to a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg and a heart rate of 40 beats per minute. His ECG demonstrated a Mobitz type II AV block. The strength in the patientâ€™s lower extremities and Babinski reflex were normal, but deep tendon reflexes were decreased. No acute pathology was detected in a head tomography. Brain diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data revealed multiple nodular and linear hyperdensity lesions that were evaluated as acute ischemia. He was hospitalized to the intensive care unit for observation by a neurologist and cardiologist after a transcutaneous cardiac pacemaker had been applied."
