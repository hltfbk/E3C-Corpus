  "text": "A 64-year-old man presented to our hospital with upper abdominal pain and anorexia. Initial laboratory examinations revealed increased total bilirubin and a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a dilated CBD. Gastroenterologists performed an endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), which revealed that the cause of obstructive jaundice was a hematoma in the CBD. Enhanced CT scan and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) performed after the hematoma was drained showed improved dilation of the CBD and an enhanced wall thickness of bile duct measuring 25 × 10 mm at the union of the cystic and common hepatic ducts. A cholangioscope detected an elevated tumor covered by sludge in the CBD, and we performed an extrahepatic bile duct resection and cholecystectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful and the pathological examination of the resected tumor revealed that although the ulcerated lesion had inflammatory granulation tissue, it did not contain the components of invasive carcinoma. Many consecutive intraepithelial micropapillary lesions spread around the ulcerated lesion, and the epithelial cells showed an increased nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, nuclear hyperchromasia, and architectural atypia. The pathological diagnosis was BilIN-1 to -2. Immunohistochemical staining showed that S100P was slightly expressed and MUC5AC was positive, while MUC1 was negative and p53 was not overexpressed."
