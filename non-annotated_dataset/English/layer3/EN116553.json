  "text": "We present the rare case of a 42-year-old-man suffering from stable angina with unusual development of 3 major components of the cardiovascular system Coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the ostium of the right coronary artery. Magnetic resonance angiography depicted an anomalous origin of the left common carotid artery from the innominate artery and an aneurysm of descending thoracic aorta. Coronary computed tomography angiography revealed the course of left coronary artery between aortic root and conus arteriosus at the level of the right ventricular outflow tract. In this report we attempt to highlight the rarity of this vascular anatomy."
