  "text": "We report a 35-year-old female who suffered from Takayasu's arteritis. The patient did not get regular treatment, and IAA and right common carotid artery aneurysm developed, which complicated with occlusion of the left carotid artery, subclavian artery, and the initial part of the left vertebral artery. The patient also had moderate aortic valve insufficiency. With inflammation being controlled well, the patient received the surgery for arterial aneurysms of innominate and right common carotid arteries and aortic valve insufficiency. The shunts for cerebral blood supply were designed to protect the brain and the surgery was conducted successfully under extracorporeal circulation."
