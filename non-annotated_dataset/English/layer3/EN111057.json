  "text": "A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with distending pain in the right flank for more than 20â€‰days. He had a history of accidental toothpick ingestion. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan and Color Doppler Ultrasound of the superficial tissue (right flank pain area) consistently revealed a linear lesion -corresponding to the toothpick- was located at the right flank next to the body surface. Surgery via lumbar approach was then successfully performed to retrieve the toothpick under local anesthesia. The post-procedural course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the third day after surgery, no complications were noted at the 18-month follow-up."
