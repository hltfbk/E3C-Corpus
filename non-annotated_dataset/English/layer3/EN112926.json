  "text": "On a farm in Midwestern Brazil, six of 47 Saanen goats died within one week. No vaccination protocols were implemented on the farm and the owner stated bat bites history on the livestock. Although rabies is endemic in Brazil, livestock vaccination is not mandatory. One 1-year-old buck was evaluated and showed non-specific clinical signs evolving within 12-h to nervous signs. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed mononuclear pleocytosis, hyperproteinemia and high glucose levels. At necropsy, no gross lesions were present. Microscopically, discrete to moderate perivascular lymphoplasmacytic cuffing in gray and white matter, neuronal necrosis, neuronophagia, and mononuclear ganglioneuritis was observed in the brainstem and cervical spinal cord. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong anti-rabies virus immunostaining. Fresh central nervous system samples were positive for rabies in direct fluorescent antibody test (dFAT) and mouse intracerebral inoculation test (MIT). Exposed livestock recommendations included immediate vaccination, a strict isolation period of 90 days, and booster vaccinations during the third and eighth weeks."
