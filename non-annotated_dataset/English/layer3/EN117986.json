  "text": "A 63-year-old Indian man developed bladder and bowel incontinence immediately following coronary bypass grafting surgery. Findings were suggestive of microcirculatory partial conus medullaris infarction. Based on his urodynamics findings he was managed with duloxetine, tolterodine and clean intermittent catheterization. The clinical presentation, serial urodynamic findings and implications are discussed."
