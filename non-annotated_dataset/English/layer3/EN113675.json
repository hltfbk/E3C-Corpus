  "text": "We are presenting a series of five cases of IFs at unusual sites, along with a detailed literature review on this individual. A 50-year-old male patient with chronic kidney disease presented with both femoral neck and right lesser trochanter IF which was managed with cannulated screws. A 53-year-old male patient on steroid presented with sternum IF. A 26-year-old male patient presented with Vitamin D deficiency and accessory navicular IF. A 60-year-old female on bisphosphonate therapy came with bilateral femoral shaft fracture. All these three patients were managed conservatively. Another 62-year-old male patient with rheumatoid arthritis presented with sacrum IF which was managed with cannulated screw fixation."
