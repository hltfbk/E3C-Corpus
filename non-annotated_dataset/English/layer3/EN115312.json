  "text": "A 57-year-old woman was admitted due to jaundice, itching and dark urine with abnormally elevated liver function. She has performed thyroidectomy followed by 100 mci radioactive I-131 ablation therapy 21 days ago. The basic hepatic protection could not efficiently prevent disease progression. The patient was further treated with methylprednisolone, the bilirubin and alanin aminotransferase were finally lowered back to normal in the follow-up visit."
