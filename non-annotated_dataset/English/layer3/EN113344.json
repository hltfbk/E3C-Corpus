  "text": "We present a case of a 22-year-old Caucasian male admitted to our hospital with fever, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia and dark urine (brown-coloured). The symptoms appeared after viral infection followed by fever. Acute kidney injury (AKI) developed as a complication, and there was a need for treatment with hemodialysis. At the clinical presentation, the patient had plasma creatine kinase (pCK) level of 130.383 U/L and plasma myoglobin level over 5000 Âµg/L. Genetic testing (molecular analysis) confirmed the diagnosis of inherited rhabdomyolysis, a metabolic disorder of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency. A previous episode with the same symptoms, the patient had four years ago but did not ask for medical treatment. The patient was discontinued from hemodialysis because of the resolution of acute kidney injury. The patient was discharged from the hospital in good condition, with a recommendation about his future lifestyle in order to prevent similar episodes."
