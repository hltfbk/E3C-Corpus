  "text": "A 43-year-old man visited the hospital due to periumbilical pain. The patient underwent imaging study and laboratory testing for evaluation of cause. Pancreatic AVM associated with pancreatitis was suspected on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was diagnosed with pancreatic AVM with pancreatitis on imaging study and angiography. Transcatheter arterial embolization with various embolic materials was performed. Follow-up computed tomography scan revealed progressive regression of AVM and improvement of pancreatitis. At two-year follow-up, the patient showed no recurrence of symptom or pancreatitis."
