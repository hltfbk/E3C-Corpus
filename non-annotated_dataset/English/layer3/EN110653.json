  "text": "Our patient was an 86-year-old man with macroglossia, ecchymotic patches and bullous lesions associated with a skin laxity on the periorbital, palmar, and glans penis areas. Skin biopsy confirmed dermal amyloid depositions. In serum immunofixation electrophoresis, prominent monoclonal immunoglobulin-M lambda light chains were detected associated with prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltration in bone marrow biopsy which was diagnosed as Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia."
