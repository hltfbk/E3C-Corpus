  "text": "A 26 years old Moroccan woman in the category of para II gravida II was admitted to the obstetrical emergency unit, after experiencing upper abdominal pain, vertigo and general weakness at home. This patient had no significant medical history prior to the onset of pregnancy. At admission, she was pale and had signs of hemorrhagic shock. Also, she had a high pulse of 140 beat per minute and a blood pressure of 60/40 mmHg. To stabilize the situation, immediately, intravenous access was established and plasma expenders and oxygen were given to this patient. Furthermore, this patient had no contraction, the uterus was tender and the cervix wasn't dilated. Ultrasonographic exam revealed a non viable intra uterine pregnancy at 35 week of gestation and an extensive intra abdominal fluid. Emergent laparotomy confirmed the important hemoperitoneum of approximately 3 liters. A low hysterotomy was performed, amniotic fluid noted clear and a dead fetus was delivered.\nThere was no uterine cause of the bleeding. An upper midline laparotomy was performed. Active bleeding was identified at the splenic hilum consistent with splenic rupture. A splenectomy was performed by a general surgeon.\nAfter temporary stabilization of blood pressure by infusion and blood transfusion, disseminated vascular coagulation set in. Despite all of our attempts, this patient died of a sudden cardiac arrest, about 7 hours after her admission."
