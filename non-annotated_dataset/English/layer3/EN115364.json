  "text": "Patients showed incomplete paraparesis caused by the ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament at uppermost thoracic spine. Cervicothoracic posterior decompression with instrumented fusion was performed. Postoperatively, the patients showed partial paraparesis when they were sitting. They showed rapid recovery from lower extremity paralysis upon lying down. After strict bed rest for one month, those patients showed no apparent development of paralysis during sitting."
