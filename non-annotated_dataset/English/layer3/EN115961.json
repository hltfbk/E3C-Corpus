  "text": "A 47-year-old Caucasian woman presented with mammographic-detected suspicious microcalcinations in an area of 8.6 x 6 cm. A radical mastectomy with a sentinel lymph node biopsy and immediate breast reconstruction with implant was performed. A histopathological report showed a massive high grade ductal carcinoma in situ, of the solid and comedo type. In one quadrant, some foci of microinvasions of less than 1 mm were present. Tumour margins were free. Isolated tumour cells were found in the sentinel lymph node. Hormone receptors were negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 status was not performed. The patient received no adjuvant systemic therapy. Eight months after the surgery, she died from hepatic failure without known breast cancer progression before. An autopsy revealed diffuse liver metastases with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive, hormone receptor negative breast cancer. Dissemination to other organs was not proven."
