  "text": "A 68-year-old woman was referred to our hospital and diagnosed with carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater with lymph node and multiple liver metastases. She underwent systemic chemotherapy with a combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. After 19 months of treatment, the primary tumor and liver metastases were difficult to detect on follow-up images. Shrinkage of the enlarged lymph nodes was also confirmed. Surgical resection was performed with curative intent after a multidisciplinary meeting. Pathological examination of the resected specimen showed no residual tumors. Systemic chemotherapy achieved a pathological complete response. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient remained free of recurrent disease at 10 months of follow-up."
