  "text": "A fifty-six-year-old Sri Lankan male, without any modifiable risk factors for ischemic heart disease presented with acute onset nausea, vomiting, sweating, abdominal discomfort and fullness without any chest pain. On examination, he had a pulse rate of 50 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 110/50 mmHg. His abdomen was distended and the liver dullness was not detectable. Subsequent ECG showed > 2 mm ST elevations with T inversions in chest leads V1 to V3, J point elevation in leads L 11, L 111, aVF and T inversion in leads L 1 and aVL. Cardiac biomarkers were normal and 2D echo showed normal left ventricular function without any regional wall motion abnormalities. Abdominal X-ray showed a distended stomach, dilated ascending and descending colon with absent rectal air. Electrocardiographic changes reverted back to normal with the resolution of bowel obstruction."
