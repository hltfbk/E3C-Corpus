  "text": "We present a case of a 26-years-old Caucasian, white woman with two forgotten encrusted ureteral stents for 48 months. Multimodal stone therapy including extracorporeal shock wave (SWL), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), ureterorenoscopy (URS), cystolithotripsy with Lithoclast, and open surgery was necessary to remove all the stones. Using the described combination of techniques, our patient was rendered stone and stent free. Urologists should bear in mind the presence of severe encrustations when they have to deal with a forgotten stent."
