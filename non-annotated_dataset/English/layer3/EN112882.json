  "text": "A 12-year-old boy sprained his left ankle while playing soccer and was referred to our clinic 4 days after the injury. At the first visit, he could walk, reporting motion pain with a VAS scale of 80 mm. On day 5, pain intensity increased to 100 mm, and a diagnosis of acute CRPS I was made. On day 7, he could not move the injured ankle; therefore celecoxib and pregabalin were administered, and physical and educational therapies started. On day 35, pain intensity was 0 mm and he could walk and run normally."
