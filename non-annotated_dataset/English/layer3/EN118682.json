  "text": "A 37-year-old woman was referred to the obstetric haematology clinic for prenatal counselling with a history of three severe post partum haemorrhages, two of which were complicated by placental retention. Platelet aggregation studies confirmed a diagnosis of platelet storage pool disease. She was counselled regarding her risk of a recurrent haemorrhage and a planned delivery was discussed. She subsequently presented at 15 weeks' gestation. Following an uneventful pregnancy, she was covered with prophylactic desmopressin and tranexamic acid before a planned induction of labour. She had a normal delivery but placenta was retained. In theatre, an uncomplicated manual removal was followed by massive haemorrhage secondary to uterine atony. Aggressive medical management and B lynch sutures at laparotomy failed to contract the uterus. Hysterectomy was therefore performed. Placental histology later showed evidence of partial placenta diffusa."
