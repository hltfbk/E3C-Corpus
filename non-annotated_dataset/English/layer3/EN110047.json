  "text": "A woman aged 26 years, nulliparous, pregnant 38 weeks gestation, with small size 1 meter 50 and a tight mitral stenosis. In this background, we noted repeated episodes of angina, and poor oral health. At admission, she was hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg, weight 60 kg, had a shallow tachypnea to 23 cycles / minute. On examination, she had dyspnea NYHA Stage II (Classification of the New York Heart Association), bilateral edema of the lower limbs, cardiopulmonary auscultation revealed a rolling end diastolic mitral with intensity 3/6, a burst of B2, tachycardia, and crackles at two discrete lung bases, no evidence for an infringement of the right cavities were observed. The electrocardiogram betrayed bifid P waves, wide (> 0.11 sec) in DI, DII and aVL, in favor of an enlarged left atrium. Echocardiography showed a mitral stenosis moderately tight with an area of 1.3cm 2 cut short axis planimetry, valvular thickening with the large and small mitral valve, left atrial dilatation with a volume of 32 ml/m 2 without spontaneous contrast or thrombus detected, moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension, global and segmental contractility (17 segments) to the limit of normal with an ejection fraction 53% left ventricular, pericardium dry, and vena cava inferior to 13 cm in diameter with normal respiratory variation. The results of standard laboratory tests were normal. On the obstetric examination is for a narrows pelvis, after a multidisciplinary discussion cesarean section under spinal anesthesia was determined. Premedication consisted of cim√©tidine 200 mg, hydroxyzine, antibiotic associated with the imidazole and Beta lactam one hour before induction of anesthesia. The patient has never previously received drugs under heart. Throughout the procedure, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, urine output, and ECG were monitored. Spinal anesthesia with 10 mg of isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% with one injection speed very slow under 3 min and nasal oxygen 4 liter/min. Incidents encountered perioperatively were hypotensive episodes, tachycardia and amounted to 96/min, these incidents were just after the installation of the engine block of the two lower limbs were readily reversible after injection titration of ephedrine, extraction of a male baby APGAR score: 10/10 with a weight of 3 kg. The venous thromboembolic disease prevention was established at the tenth hour postoperative: enoxaparin 0.4 ml subcutaneously, multimodal analgesia, diuretics, filling echo guided, and digitalis. The patient transferred on the fourth day in the maternity ward with cardiac monitoring."
