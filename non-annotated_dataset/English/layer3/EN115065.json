  "text": "A 19-year-old Caucasian female, with a prior diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in remission, presented with bilateral lower limb ulcers 4 years after the diagnosis of AIH. She was diagnosed with PG and treated with high-dose prednisolone, methotrexate and cyclosporine. One year later she was well, the ulcers completely healed, and with the autoimmune hepatitis still in remission."
