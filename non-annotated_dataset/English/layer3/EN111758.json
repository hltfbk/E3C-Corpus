  "text": "Here, we report the case of a 48-year-old male patient who presented with a history of persistent local erythema lasting for 2 years on the thenar eminence of the left palm. Initially diagnosed as hand eczema, the condition did not improve with intermittent treatment with anti-allergy medications or topical glucocorticoid ointments, among other approaches. Then, the area of erythema gradually enlarged and was accompanied by mild itching. For a definite diagnosis and treatment, the patient came to our hospital. Dermoscopic examination revealed BD, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. We performed partial resection of the skin lesion followed by photodynamic therapy. No recurrence was observed at the 6-mo follow-up."
