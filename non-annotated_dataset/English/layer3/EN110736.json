  "text": "We present the case of a 62-year-old woman arriving to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of intractable vomiting after ingestion of kratom. After a day of yard work, she was in pain, secondary to her osteoporotic joints. She was recommended kratom from a family member, who stated he was using kratom to transition away from opioid dependence. She took two \"scoops.\" She proceeded to have multiple episodes of vomiting at home. She came to the ED, where she required multiple rounds of anti-emetic medication for resolution of her symptoms."
