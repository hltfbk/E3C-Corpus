  "text": "A 70-year-old South-Asian woman with no prior history of cardiovascular disease presented following an accidental low voltage electrocution with loss of consciousness. On initial assessment she was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a moderate to rapid ventricular rate. Troponin I and 2D echo were normal. Transient rise in markers of muscle damage were noted. The arrhythmia resolved spontaneously without active intervention."
