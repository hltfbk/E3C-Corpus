  "text": "A 45-year-old man diagnosed with stage III MM (Î» type) was treated with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Fourteen days after the second course, he complained of intense burning sensation in the lower limbs and hands, loss of tactile sensation, and pain in the distal area of both thighs and in the distal part of both wrist joints. Neurological examination revealed absence of knee and ankle reflexes. CSF examination revealed albuminocytologic dissociation. Nerve conduction studies indicated sensory nerve action potential amplitudes, conduction velocity decrease, and F wave latency prolongation. He was diagnosed as MM complicated with GBS. Subsequently, he was treated with high-dose IVIG (400 mg/kg/d for five days). His symptoms fully resolved without relapse at the 6-month follow-up."
