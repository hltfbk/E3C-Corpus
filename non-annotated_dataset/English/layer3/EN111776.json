  "text": "The patient was treated with high dose steroids, and subsequently developed malignant hypertension and acute renal failure, later identified on biopsy as steroids-induced scleroderma renal crisis. Although Neuromyelitis Optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) has often been associated with various collagen and autoimmune diseases, the coexistence of NMOSD and SSc presented a challenge where the patient underwent aggressive physical therapy and necessitated an intervention with Rituximab to achieve an appropriate clinical response. We have received a written consent forms from the participant in our study, and we have them on file in case they are requested. We have also received the patient's written consent for the data and images presented in this article."
