  "text": "The case of a 43-year-old Japanese man with multiple chondromas and hemangiomas (Maffucci syndrome) is reported. One of the hemangiomas was removed and examined pathologically. The morphological picture was an admixture of cavernous hemangioma and spindle cell hemangioma without cytological atypia or mitosis. Sheets of vacuolated endothelial cells were also observed."
