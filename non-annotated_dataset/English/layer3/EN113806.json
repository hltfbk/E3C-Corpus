  "text": "A 63-year-old woman was presented with a-three-year history of RA and a recent discovery of an excavated pulmonary nodule. Initial investigations focused on a rheumatoid origin. The evolution of the disease was worrisome and surgical exploration was deemed mandatory. The result was the discovery of a nodule of a malignant nature."
