  "text": "A 50-year-old man presented with vertigo and progressive hearing loss in the right ear. MRI examination revealed a lesion in the CPA with solid and cystic components. Surgery was performed. Well-circumscribed adhesion to cranial nerves, the cerebellum, or the brain stem was noted during surgery. The lesion was totally resected. Pathological examination suggested the lesion to be a CM. At 1-year follow-up, the symptoms at presentation had resolved and no complications had occurred."
