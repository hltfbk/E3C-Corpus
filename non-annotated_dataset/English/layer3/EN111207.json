  "text": "A 75-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for nearly 5 years on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was admitted to the nephrology department with a 1-week history of abdominal pain and a cloudy peritoneal dialysis effluent. Based on the history, physical examination and laboratory results with the findings in the peritoneal dialysis fluid, a diagnosis of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis was confirmed. The final culture of initial peritoneal effluent results indicated the organism was P. multocida. After a 12-day antibiotic treatment, the condition of patient was not improved. The patient was switched to ampicillin/sulbactam (3 g intravenously) twice every day and the condition was improved significantly. On further inquiring, the patient reported that he had had a cat at home and when the patient did CAPD, the cat was usually playing with the tubing or contacting the patient during CAPD."
