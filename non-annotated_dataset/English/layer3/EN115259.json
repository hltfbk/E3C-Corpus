  "text": "A 26-year-old white male presented with febrile upper respiratory infection symptoms and had an EKG change, which was initially misinterpreted as an ST elevated myocardial infarction due to ST-T segment elevation in leads V1 and V2. The patient reported past recurrent syncopal episodes leading to a recent suspected diagnosis of BrS. A later episode of febrile illness, triggering a Type 1 EKG pattern, led to a subsequent hospital admission for continuous cardiac monitoring. On that occasion, he was placed on a wearable external defibrillator pending placement of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) device."
