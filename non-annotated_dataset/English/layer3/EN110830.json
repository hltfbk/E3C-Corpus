  "text": "A 70-year-old Caucasian man, positive for asymptomatic lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, presented with a blind painful right eye in our ophthalmology department to evaluate enucleation bulbi. After enucleation, a histopathologic examination revealed the presence of intertrabecular infiltration in the metaplastic bone marrow of non-Hodgkin B lymphoma, with small lymphocytes, with similar characteristics to the already known disease."
