  "text": "A 74-year-old Japanese man who had hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma and was successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation four times underwent direct-acting antiviral therapy with daclatasvir and asunaprevir; sustained virologic response at 24 weeks was confirmed. However, although he had no high risk factors for reinfection, hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid was detected again 6 months after achieving sustained virologic response at 24 weeks. Moreover, he developed active hepatitis with an increased viral load. Five months after development of hepatitis, recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma emerged in segment II, where we had performed radiofrequency ablation 17 months previously. The recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma enlarged quite rapidly and induced multiple peritoneal disseminations and lung metastases. He died 3 months after the abrupt recurrence. A sarcomatous change in the hepatocellular carcinoma was identified during the autopsy."
