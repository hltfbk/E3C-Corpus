  "text": "We report a case of 25 years old female patient of African ethnicity who presented with a 2 × 2 cm mass attached to the left mandibular gingiva in cuspid- bicuspid region which is an unusual site for AOT. It was accompanied by slight bone loss. With the differential diagnosis of gingival epulis and peripheral ossifying fibroma; surgical excision was performed. The light microscopic examination of the specimen aided the final diagnosis of Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor with the histopathological features identical to its intra osseous counterpart."
