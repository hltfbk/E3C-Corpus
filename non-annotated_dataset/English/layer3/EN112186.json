  "text": "Herein, we present a case report of a six-year-old male patient who was diagnosed with noma infection at a Chinese pediatric medical intensive care unit (PMICU), at which time, it was discovered that he had septic shock. Following treatment by continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for septic shock arising from noma, the patient was in generally good condition, and the local wound was seen to be essentially healed five weeks post-admission."
