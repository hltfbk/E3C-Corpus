  "text": "A 76-year-old woman presented with a right ventricle tumor that was detected incidentally on screening cardiac ultrasonography. The initial computed tomography (CT) scan showed the cardiac tumor, which was approximately 40 mm in size, and multiple pulmonary nodules. Serum levels of tumor markers CEA and CA19-9 were elevated aberrantly. The suspected primary tumor, a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon with wild-type KRAS was found by colonoscopy, and treatment with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (modified FOLFOX6) plus panitumumab was initiated. After 4 courses of the therapy, a CT scan showed that the cardiac tumor size had markedly decreased and the pulmonary nodules had diminished. The serum levels of CEA and CA19-9 were also markedly decreased. After 12 courses of chemotherapy during 10Â months of treatment, the patient continued to show a partial response, and she remained asymptomatic with continuation of the treatment through 15 courses."
