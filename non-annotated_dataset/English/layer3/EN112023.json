  "text": "A 61-year-old African American male with past medical history of hypertension and schizophrenia presented to the emergency room following 2 episodes of syncope and 3-month history of progressive neck mass. CT scan of neck, abdomen and pelvis showed bulky left cervical, supraclavicular and axillary lymph node, mass in anterior aspect of heart, and multiple solid left renal masses and probable right renal mass. Echocardiogram revealed a large RV mass with deformation of the RV free wall suggesting malignant growth. Core biopsy of the right superficial gluteal mass revealed a metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma of likely renal origin, with a possibility of an unclassified RCC. Due to the extent and burden of metastasis, patient and family members agreed to conservative management and evaluation for hospice care."
