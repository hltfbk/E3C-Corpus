  "text": "We present a 70â€‰year old woman with history of psoriasis and treatment refractory CD requiring monoclonal antibody therapy with ustekinumab. One month prior to the current admission, she developed abdominal pain, worsening diarrhea and was diagnosed with CD exacerbation for which she was given ustekinumab. While her abdominal symptoms mildly improved with ustekinumab, she developed new bilateral lower extremity rash initially treated with levofloxacin for presumed cellulitis. The rash consisted of mild erythematous, non-scaling patches with scattered non-palpable petechiae on the lower extremities with subsequent involvement of abdomen, lower back and buttocks. Abdominal exam showed diffuse tenderness without mass, guarding or rebound while reminder of physical exam was unremarkable. Following the failure of antimicrobial therapy, she was diagnosed with LCV by skin biopsy. Complete work up was negative for infectious, malignant and inflammatory etiologies of LCV. Patient improved with increased dose of budesonide and subsequently continued to tolerate ustekinumab without recurrence of LCV."
