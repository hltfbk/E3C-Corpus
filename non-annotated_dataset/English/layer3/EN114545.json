  "text": "A 72-year-old Japanese man, who had been followed for ten years after surgery and chemotherapy for treatment of hilar and lower bile duct cancers, developed intermittent fever and abdominal pain and visited this hospital. Blood examinations revealed an inflammatory reaction, worsened glucose intolerance, and an increased level of serum IgG4 (137 mg/dL). Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm-sized mass in hepatic segment 7. Because of his cancer history, not only was a benign mass suspected, but there was also the possibility of a recurrent biliary malignancy. Liver biopsy was performed and the histology met the criteria for IgG4-related IPT. Corticosteroid therapy was initiated and his symptoms quickly resolved. However, two months later, a repeat CT demonstrated that the hepatic mass had been replaced by an abscess. The abscess was initially refractory, despite tapering corticosteroid treatment, controlling diabetes by intensive insulin therapy, administration of antibiotics, and percutaneous abscess drainage. Finally, after six months, the condition resolved."
