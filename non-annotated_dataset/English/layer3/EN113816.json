  "text": "Here, we present a case of a 5-year-old male child of Middle Eastern origin who had been diagnosed as having alpha thalassemia and was undergoing chronic blood transfusions. He later presented with hypopigmented skin lesions and atrophy post-photosensitivity, persistent red-colored urine and hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory investigations showed a high level of porphyrin metabolites in his plasma and erythrocytes. As a result, he was diagnosed as having Congenital erythropoietic porphyria."
