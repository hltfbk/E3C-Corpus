  "text": "We report the case of a 65-year-old female treated with an arthroscopic rotator cuff repair who had significant extravasation of arthroscopic fluid causing severe facial and neck swelling. Overnight intubation was required for respiratory monitoring until the edema had resolved enough to allow safe extubation."
