  "text": "We report a case of a patient with a chronically occluded right coronary artery, found on a coronary angiography performed due to acute ST elevation myocardial infarction with an occluded circumflex artery as a culprit lesion. Three months later, a follow-up angiography was performed and a recanalization of the occluded right coronary artery was detected."
