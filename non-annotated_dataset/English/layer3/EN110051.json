  "text": "A 44-year-old woman with HIV/AIDS of 8 years duration developed progressive breathlessness on exertion and fatigue over the past two years. She denied any cough, chest pain, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, or orthopnoea. Her past medical history was significant of well controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension. It was learnt that the patient had been followed-up for a right atrial thrombus for 2 years and had received warfarin since then. She has also been on Combivir (zidovudine + lamivudine) and nevirapine for over 8 years. Her most recent CD4 count was 367 units/ml with undetectable viral loads. In 2004, she presented with renal insufficiency and nephrotic range proteinuria that subsequently receded after a short course of oral steroids and initiation of highly active antiretrovirals (HAART). She had, since then, been followed for a stable stage 3 chronic kidney disease. She stopped cigarette smoking and alcohol intake about two years ago. She denied any history of drug abuse and she had never been on oral contraceptive pills. On admission, she was clinically afebrile but desaturated at SO 2 85% on room air. Her blood pressure was 117/76 mm Hg and she had a pulse rate of 96 beats per minute. There was marked dilatation of both jugular veins and mild bilateral ankle oedema. She had no murmurs and her lungs were clear. A 12-lead electrocardiogram detected a sinus rhythm of 96 beats per minutes, right axis deviation, and an incomplete right bundle-branch block. A chest X-ray showed moderate cardiomegaly with clear lung fields. Her laboratory results were: WBC, 6370/ml; Haemoglobin, 13.3g/dl; platelets, 274 × 10 9 /l; Sodium, 140mmol/l; Potassium, 5.5mmol/l; Urea, 13.3mmol/l; Creatinine, 181µmol/l; ALP, 354U/l; ALT, 23.2u/l; AST, 37.3U/l; total protein, 86.5g/l; albumin, 37.3g/l; and glucose 12.88mmol/l. Arterial blood gases showed: PH 7.42; PC0 2 40mmHg; PO 2 56mmHg and HC0 3 25.1mmol/l. Two dimensional transthoracic and trans-oesophageal echocardiographs showed a large lobulated and mobile mass in the right atrium. It was attached posteriorly to the lower part of the right atrium and extended into inferior vena cava. The tricuspid valves were not distinctively visible. The mass was moving to and fro into the right ventricle with each cycle without any significant occlusion of the tricuspid valve. There was a free flow of blood between the right atrium and ventricle. The right atrium and ventricle were dilated. The right and left ventricular systolic functions were normal. There was no evidence of pericardial effusion. The superior vena cava was normal. The abdominal ultrasound confirmed the extension of the mass into the inferior vena cava. Other abdominal findings were otherwise unremarkable. Despite over two years of anticoagulant therapy, the mass remained unchanged in size. She consequently underwent surgery. At operation, a rubbery, creamy coloured and mobile atrial mass (5 × 5 × 3 cm) arising from the inferior vena cava (IVC) was appreciated. It was free from the right atrial wall and the tricuspid valve but extended into the inferior vena cava. The atrial mass was easily detached from the junction of the inferior vena cava and removed completely. The extension into the IVC was fixed to the caval walls. It was not removed as this would have ruptured the inferior vena cava. Histology revealed a fibrous tissue with embedded red cells and extensive calcification, compatible with a calcified thrombus. The patient died 24 hours postoperatively due persistent hypotension and progressive right failure. The chest was re-opened before she died and revealed a tense dilated right atrium, hypokinetic right ventricle with no evidence of pericardial effusion. She most likely died from pulmonary embolism caused by fragments from the IVC thrombus."
