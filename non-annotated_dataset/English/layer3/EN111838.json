  "text": "A 67-year-old Caucasian male presented with an anterior-posterior compression pelvic ring injury after he was struck by an oncoming vehicle on his motorcycle. Radiographs revealed pubic symphyseal widening of 4.7 cm. A pelvic binder was placed as a temporary measure to minimize intrapelvic hemorrhage. Advanced imaging revealed a complete, midline sagittal sacral fracture through the posterior sacral elements. During his hospital admission, the patient required multiple procedures for sustained upper extremity fractures and subsequently underwent surgical fixation of his anterior and posterior pelvic ring injuries 2 days after admission. Our patient to date has achieved sacral fracture union, minimal residual pubic diastasis, and has no evidence of neurologic injury. He has some persistent impotence and is ambulating without assistance. Despite his significant injuries, his outcome to date has been quite impressive."
