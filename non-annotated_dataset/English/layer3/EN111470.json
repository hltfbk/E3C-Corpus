  "text": "Herein, we reported a 46-year-old man presenting with right nasal block, epistaxis, and epiphora from the right eye for one month. The nasal endoscopy revealed a friable mass arising from the anterior half of the right nasal cavity. Histological findings were suggestive of Ewing sarcoma. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the paranasal sinuses showed a soft tissue mass in the right anterior nasal cavity with mucosal thickening in the right maxillary sinus, without any bony erosion or distant metastasis. The patient underwent endoscopic medial maxillectomy with modified Denker's procedure, followed by a 6-cycle course of chemotherapy. He was clinically well after chemotherapy; however, the recent bone scans were suggestive of bone involvement with the tumor."
