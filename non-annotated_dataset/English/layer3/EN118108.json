  "text": "A 20-year old patient treated for meningitis was referred to us for vision blurring of his left eye. Unilateral endogenous panophthalmitis was diagnosed with visual acuity hand movement at 1 meter and vitreous sample was obtained for culture. The patient was already receiving intravenous ceftriaxone and dexamethasone. Ceftazidime was injected intravitreally. Four months later visual acuity improved to 4/10 on the Snellen's scale but the development of extensive fibrous strands and the risk for vessel rupture led to vitreous surgery. One year later the visual acuity is stable at 5/10."
