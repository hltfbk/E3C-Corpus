  "text": "Our patient was a 46-year-old Korean man. Transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac catheterization demonstrated hemodynamically balanced ventricles with a non-regurgitant systemic atrioventricular valve, normal pulmonary arterial pressure, and a reasonable difference between the oxygen saturation values of the aorta and pulmonary trunk, even with the presence of a large ventricular septal defect. Further morphological assessments using cardiac computed tomography and three-dimensional modeling/printing of his heart revealed that the mitral valve was straddling over the posteriorly positioned ventricular septal defect, which could explain the functional and anatomical subvalvular pulmonary stenosis and a small amount of shunt flow through the large ventricular septal defect. We interpreted this combination of cardiac defects as able to sustain his stable cardiac function. Thus, we decided to maintain his unoperated status."
