  "text": "We present the case of a man who suffered from a low-voltage electrical injury followed by ischemic stroke. Magnetic resonance angiography showed segmental narrowing of the right internal carotid artery and right middle cerebral artery. The patient underwent thrombolytic therapy and catheter-assisted angioplasty. The low-voltage current-induced vasospasm rather than direct vascular injury, and this may explain why the intracranial defect occurred away from the electrical current pathway."
