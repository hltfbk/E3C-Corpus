  "text": "We present the case of a 38-year-old Middle Eastern woman with a large, slowly-growing gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the duodenum. Her complaints were minor epigastric discomfort and swelling. A pancreaticoduodenectomy with complete tumor excision was performed. She was doing very well with no evidence of disease recurrence when she was last seen 34 months after her operation."
