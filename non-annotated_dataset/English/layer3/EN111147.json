  "text": "We present a case of a 16-year-old young man with a history of quick jerks since childhood. They progressed gradually over the years involving the entire body and interfering with most of his daily activities. He had no dystonia. Genetic testing identified a single base deletion in exonÂ 3 of the SGCE gene, considered very likely pathogenic. After unsuccessfully trying several oral medications, he underwent DBS of the globus pallidus internus (GPi). His Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale score during rest and with action improved by 92.8% and 82.6%, respectively."
