  "text": "We report a case of 70-year-old female presenting with hemoptysis. Computed tomography angiography showed hypervascular lesions in the lingula of the left lung abutting the pericardium. Three-dimensional reconstruction image revealed an aberrant systemic arterial supply communicating with the left pulmonary artery and co-supplying the pulmonary parenchyma of the left upper. Single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with anomalous vessel ligation and lingual segmentectomy were performed smoothly. The symptom of hemoptysis subsided after operation with 2-year follow up."
