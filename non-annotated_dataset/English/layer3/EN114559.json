  "text": "A 67-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for dizziness, dysarthria, and dysphagia. He was diagnosed with lateral medullary syndrome based on the neurological examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging. Horner syndrome was absent. Asymptomatic hyponatremia appeared 9 days after admission and the patient was diagnosed with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Fluid restriction and intravenous furosemide injection improved the hyponatremia."
