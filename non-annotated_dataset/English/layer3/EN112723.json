  "text": "The patient had a persistent cough for one month and had been clinically diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in 2011. He worked in a stone processing factory from the ages of 20 through 37 and has owned his own mill for the past 25 years. His chest radiograph showed significant increases in the size and number of lung nodules since his last follow-up in 2013. By percutaneous needle lung biopsy, the nodular lesions showed diffuse infiltration of phagocytic macrophages and birefringent crystals by polarizing microscopy. He was finally diagnosed with RPP of mixed dust pneumoconiosis combined with silicosis."
