  "text": "A man aged 25 was admitted in our department on August 1999 with chronic diarrhea and loss of weight. His bowel symptoms started in 1998 at the age of 24. However, two years previously (June 1996) he noticed a swelling of the lower lip, which contrasted significantly with the previously normal appearance of his mouth. A lip biopsy performed at that time was compatible with granulomatous cheilitis. Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum and large bowel was diagnosed in 1998 and confirmed on the basis of colonoscopy, enteroclysis and histology findings of the small and large bowel. Conservative treatment resulted in clinical and laboratory improvement of the bowel symptoms and lip swelling. During the following years the disease was active with exacerbations and remissions of mild to moderate severity. The swelling of the lower lip occurred in parallel with the exacerbations of the bowel disease, returning to normal during periods of remission."
