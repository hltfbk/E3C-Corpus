  "text": "A previously healthy 54-year-old First Nations Canadian man presented with intermittent gross hematuria. He underwent surgical excision of his right testis for cryptorchidism and a transurethral resection of a bladder mass. Histology showed an active medium vessel vasculitis in both organs. On extensive clinical, laboratory, and radiographic review, he had no systemic features of vasculitis. On 2-year follow-up, he has not required any systemic therapy and has not developed further symptoms."
