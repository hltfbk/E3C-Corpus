  "text": "A 51-year-old Korean man was diagnosed as having acute myeloid leukemia and received induction chemotherapy. After prolonged severe neutropenia, he complained of coughing with aspiration. Imaging showed a bronchoesophageal fistula with extensive necrotizing pneumonia in the middle and lower lobes of his right lung. Bronchoscopy showed near total tissue necrosis in the middle lobe of his right lung, creating an orifice. A bronchial scope was passed through and was able to be connected with his esophagus; a bronchial wall biopsy was performed. Esophagoscopy revealed a large linear defect of his esophageal wall 30 cm from the incision that may have connected with the bronchus. A bronchial biopsy showed typical hyphae with necrotic tissue, indicating pulmonary mucormycosis. He was given amphotericin B, and a wide excision of lung and esophagus was planned. However, he suddenly died due to massive hemoptysis."
