  "text": "Our patient was an 8 years old child with a history of epilepsy. She experienced her first seizure at the age of 5 years. She had a normal neuropsychological development. There was no family history of epilepsy. The physical examination was normal. Her seizures began with what it was described as «weird feeling» and then followed by automatism (chewing). This seizure lasted about 1 minute and 30 seconds. Our patient expressed total amnesia of her seizures. 1.5 Tesla MRI revealed a small round cyst in the right choroidal fissure of the temporal horn compressing the hippocampus. The signal intensity of the cyst was hyposignal T1, hypersignal T2, no restriction of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), identical to that of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). There was no peripheral contrast enhancement or surrounding edema. Based on the MR features, the presumptive diagnosis of a choroidal fissure cyst was made and seizures were medically controlled by Carbamazepine."
