  "text": "A 65-year-old woman presented with a self-palpated breast lump that had discordant radio-pathological features. While imaging results were compatible with an infiltrative malignancy, on core needle biopsy (CNB) a sharply delineated lesion composed by a bland-looking population of spindle cells was observed; excision was recommended for final diagnosis. Histology of the resection specimen showed small areas of epithelial differentiation and foci of peripheral invasion. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a co-immunoreactivity for epithelial and myoepithelial markers in the spindle cell component. Mutation analysis with a capture-based next generation sequencing method revealed pathogenic mutations in GNAS, TERT-promotor and PIK3R1 genes. A diagnosis of LG-FLMC was rendered."
