  "text": "A 70-year old male presented to the emergency department for chest pain. The patient had cardiac arrest before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was inserted with ECMO. Although he was successfully weaned from ECMO 4 days after PCI, he consistently complained swelling, abnormal sensation, and weakness in his right lower extremity, where the cannulas were inserted. Imaging studies showed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right leg, which was further treated with anticoagulants. Symptoms, however, remained after the regression of DVT. Nerve conduction study revealed femoral neuropathy, which may have been caused by ECMO cannula compression and tissue swelling."
