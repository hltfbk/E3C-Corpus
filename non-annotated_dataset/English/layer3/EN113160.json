  "text": "We treated 3 consecutive infants aged less than 12 months with sirolimus, an oral mTOR inhibitor. All patients achieved significant reductions in cardiac rhabdomyomas. A complete response was documented in 2 patients, while a partial response with tumor debulking greater than 50% was seen in the other one. The median time to best cardiac response was 1.9 months in all patients, and 3.3 months in those with complete response. The side effects profile was acceptable."
