  "text": "A 75 year-old male patient who had undergone OLT for decompensated HCV-cirrhosis in 2009, and bilio-digestive surgery in 2011 under tracrolimus (0.5 mg/day) and prednisone (5 mg/day) immunosuppressive therapy, started to receive antiviral treatment for recurrent HCV-infection of graft with 200 mg/day ribavirin in combination with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir by the end of October 2015. Because of multiple side effects (anemia, asthenia, infections, and reduction of kidney functions - palliated by treatment with erythropoietin), treatment was stopped after 16 weeks. At the third control, a minimal increase in alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serum level to 10 μg/L was measured 8 months after therapy, whereas both liver sonography and serum transaminases were normal. The patient's general condition; however, remained poor, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of abdomen was performed 2 months later. A nodule of 3 cm in diameter with a pseudocapsule was found centrally in the liver. The patient had to be hospitalized for recurrent infections of the lung, overt ascites and peritonitis. Rapid tumor growth (10 cm) was detected during last stay in hospital (April 2017), concomitant with a rise of AFP-serum levels to 91 μg/L. The family decided to take the patient home, and best supportive care was provided by a general practitioner, local nurses and the patient's dedicated wife until his death."
