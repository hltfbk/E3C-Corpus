  "text": "An asymptomatic 61-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of elevated levels of tumor markers. Imaging revealed an intramural lesion of the uterine corpus exhibiting fluorodeoxyglucose uptake. A total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. The tumor was completely confined to the corpus wall and was composed of an intracystic bulky component and an invasive component in the myometrial layer. The tumor exhibited a variety of growth patterns, including a characteristic tubular pattern with dense eosinophilic secretion reminiscent of the thyroid, as well as a variety of morphologies, such as acinar, papillary, and ductal structures. The structures were immunoreactive for CK7, vimentin, CD10, calretinin, PAX8, and GATA3 and almost completely negative for ER/PgR. CA125 and CA19-9 antigen expression was also detected."
