  "text": "This article reports a very rare case of a 40-year-old patient who developed acute pericardial and pleural effusions (both bloody), acute respiratory distress, peripheral hematoma of the ascending aorta, and acute cerebral infarction after PCI. The patient's ECG showed bow-back downward ST elevation in leads I, II, III, and V4-V6. A blood test showed significant increases in eukaryotic-cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Echocardiography and pulmonary artery computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed a large amount of pericardial effusion and pleural effusion. CTA of the thoracic and abdominal aorta showed a peripheral hematoma of the ascending aorta. A cranial computed tomography (CT) showed cerebral infarction anterior to the anterior horn of the right ventricle. After tracheal intubation, ventilator breathing support, pericardial and pleural drainage, and adrenocortical steroid (prednisone) treatment, he gradually recovered and was discharged 20â€‰days later."
