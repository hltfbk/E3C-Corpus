  "text": "We report a case of extra-adrenal non-functional adrenocortical carcinoma in a 15-year-old Persian boy who presented with an acute abdomen. He underwent surgical resection. Pathologic findings based on immunohistochemistry and cellular morphology confirmed adrenocortical carcinoma. He was treated with mitotane for 24 months. During a follow-up period of 30 months, no recurrence or metastases were found."
