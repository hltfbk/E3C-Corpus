  "text": "A case of PXA that was initially diagnosed as GBM is presented. A 42-year-old man visited our clinic because of right hemiparesis and total aphasia. Head magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated enhanced multiple cystic lesions in the left temporal lobe suggesting an intra-parenchymal brain tumor. The lesion was partially removed and GBM with a Ki-67 index of 20 % was diagnosed by pathological examination of the resected specimen. Despite receiving radiation and chemotherapy, the patient died 6 months after the first admission. At autopsy, the boundary between the tumor and normal brain tissue was clear. Large parts of the tumor demonstrated typical features of PXA, including pleomorphism, clear xanthomatous cells with foamy cytoplasm, positive silver staining, and a Ki-67 index of less than 1 %."
