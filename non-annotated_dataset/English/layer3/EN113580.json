  "text": "An 83-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain after a motor accident. We performed intestinal resection and splenectomy for intestinal perforation and splenic hemorrhage and treated conservatively for acute AD, liver injury, renal hematoma, and pneumothorax. On postoperative day (POD) 2, the patient had localized abdominal pain. Follow-up computed tomography suggested a smaller superior mesenteric vein sign and segmental lack of enhancement in the intestinal wall and ascites without SMA occlusion. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with NOMI. Although the patient had type B AD including the SMA, we performed selective mesenteric arteriography and transcatheter papaverine infusion via the SMA and prostaglandin via the peripheral vein. Seven days post treatment, mesenteric blood flow improved and intestinal wall enhancement was restored."
