  "text": "A 60-year-old Japanese man presented with swelling of the medial side of his right thigh, and he complained of nighttime pain and slight tenderness. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a 4 × 4 cm mass in the right thigh. Open biopsy was performed. The mass was diagnosed histologically as a benign fibrous tumor, and we maintained follow-up without surgical therapy. After one year, magnetic resonance imaging showed an increase in tumor size to 4 × 5 cm, but the histologic findings were the same as those obtained one year earlier. Resection was performed with narrow surgical margins. Pathologic diagnosis was desmoplastic fibroblastoma. Two years after surgery, the patient is free from pain and shows no signs or symptoms of recurrence."
