  "text": "Patient K.R., 42 years old, without any particular pathological antecedents, who has had bilateral cervicobrachialgia for the past 9 months without any sensorimotor deficit, evolving in an unquantified weight loss context. On clinical examination, there was noticeable pain on the mobilization of the cervical spine. Standard radiography showed osteolysis with compression of the body of C4. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the CT scan data and revealed a compression of the C4 vertebral body with epiduritis, or spinal epidural abscess and infiltration of the paravertebral soft tissues, suggesting primarily an infectious origin. The biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of active tuberculosis. The patient was treated with an anterior arthrodesis and quadruple tuberculosis chemotherapy for 12 months.\nPost-rehabilitation showed improvement in patients' neurological symptoms, and his wellbeing with no signs of tuberculosis recurrence."
