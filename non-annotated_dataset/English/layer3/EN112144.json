  "text": "A young adult diagnosed and previously operated for ES of the left scapula, presented to us with a massive fun gating mass over the left upper back, excruciating pain and inability to use the left upper limb. Limb salvage surgery was performed, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and autologous stem-cell transplantation. The patient is disease free with a functional limb on 3 years of follow-up."
