  "text": "Here, we reported the case of a 57-year-old Chinese woman with MG. She experienced progressive muscle weakness for 1 week. MG with acute exacerbation was initially suspected. However, further biochemistry tests found mild hyperkalemia (5.6 mEq/L) and a lower renal potassium excretion rate. Consequently, low aldosterone action was highly suspected. Further findings included a suppressed cortisol level, a higher adrenocorticotropic hormone concentration, and 21-hydroxylase antibody positivity, supporting a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency due to autoimmune adrenalitis."
