  "text": "We present a case of a 53Â year-old woman with synchronous occurrence of four malignancies including HDGC, GIST, esophageal small cell- and local squamous carcinoma in situ. A total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and paclitaxel liposome were performed. After a 1-year follow-up, this patient was still in good condition with no evidence of recurrence."
