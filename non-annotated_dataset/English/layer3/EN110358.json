  "text": "A 3-year-old girl was admitted to our emergency department, with a history of falling from a 2-meter high bed while playing, crushing the right side of her head on a marble floor, approximately one hour before admission. During the initial examination, the child was crying, moving her arms and legs, but did not respond to verbal stimuli. In addition, two episodes of vomiting have been reported.\nThe GCS on admission was 12(E:2, M: 5, V:5). Gradually, in the next two hours, the patient's breathing became irregular and response to stimuli worsened (GCS:7 E:1, M:3, V:3); hence the child was intubated and underwent an emergency brain and cervical spine CT scan, which revealed no pathological findings. She was then admitted to the intensive care unit. A catheter for intracranial pressure monitoring was placed. The initial ICP was 14mmHg and remained between the normal values the following day.\nWhen the patient was awakened, next day, tremor of torso, arms and legs was present. Neurological examination revealed hyperactive deep tendon reflexes, neck stiffness and positive Babinski sign on right foot. Right pupil was slightly dilated. The patient started treatment with levetiracetam 40mg/kg/d, Clobazam 1,5mg/kg/d and dexmedetomidine 0,2g/kg/h.\nA brain MRI revealed high signal changes on T2W and flair sequences, at the junction of gray and white matter, in both hemispheres, but mainly in the right frontal lobe, the right cerebellar hemisphere, the vermis and the splenium of corpus callosum. The lesions have a round shape, which is commonly described as \"axonal bulb\" or \"retraction ball\" and indicates diffuse axonal injuries (DAI), due to shear-strain deformations of brain tissue, and also the subacute phase of the injury [2]. The lesions located in the corpus callosum and basal ganglia on the right side are suggested to play a significant role regarding the presence of both tremor and dystonia. In addition, the diffuse axonal injuries in the cerebellar hemispheres and vermis may have contributed to the appearance of tremor [3, 4]. No pathological findings were present on spine MRI. The patient remained in the intensive care unit for two more days and then returned to our neurosurgical department. She was discharged home three days later with significant improvement of tremor. In the next six months the child was winning off the drugs and in one year follow up she is free of symptoms with no drugs."
