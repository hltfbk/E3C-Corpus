  "text": "30-year old male patient had decompression operation due to cranial fracture 15 years ago. He had cranioplasty operation 12 years ago. Two weeks ago he complained of headache, and abscess formation on the frontal bone. The abscess formation was surgically drained at the Neurosurgey Department and sent to Izmir University School of Medicine Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. The specimen was cultivated on blood agar, chocolate agar and eosin metylene blue agar. After two days of incubation at 37?C; pink mucoid colonies were detected on blood agar. The identification of the strain was carried out by automatized Vitek 2.0 (Biomerieux, France). The culture reported the isolate as Roseomonas gliardii. The isolate was susceptible to amikacin, imipenem, levofloxacin, tigecycline, ciprofloxacin, and resistant to meropenem and tazobactam/piperacillin. Then his complaints continued and he underwent neurosurgical operation and cranioplasty was removed the from the cranium. The patient recovered thereafter."
