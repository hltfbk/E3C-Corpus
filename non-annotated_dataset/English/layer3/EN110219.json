  "text": "This paper present a male infant, aged 20 months, born of consanguineous marriage, without special perinatal history, that was referred to the Pediatric Nephrology department because of growth retardation associated with a psychomotor impairment, dysmorphic features and nephrocalcinosis. Birth weight was 3200 g and the height was 48 cm. He had psychomotor retardation: smile-response acquired five months, holding the head at 10 months, sitting at 15 months, standing at 20 months and walking not yet acquired. At the age of 3 months, he had a bilateral inguinal hernia surgery. From the age of four months he had hypotonia, chronic vomiting associated with constipation and poor weight gain. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal. An abdominal ultrasound showed a rudimentary right kidney and a normal-sized left kidney with nephrocalcinosis, without dilatation of the excretory cavities.\nAdmission physical examination found a very characteristic face: flat nasal bridge, everted lower lip, full cheeks, epicanthus, retrognathia, low-set ears and high arched palate. We did not find abnormal bones or spinal deformities. The weight and size were at three standard deviations below the mean and the head circumference was at one standard deviation above the mean. Cardiac auscultation was normal; blood pressure was suitable for age. He had hypercalcaemia (2.83 mmol/l) with normal creatinine level (24 Âµmol/l).\nThe urine test showed hypercalciuria with a urinary calcium / urinary creatinine ratio: 1.627 (normal ratio < 0.5). Echocardiography was normal. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. Thyroid tests were normal. DMSA renal scintigraphy showed a single left kidney in its normal place. The diagnosis of Williams-Beuren syndrome was defined and confirmed by genetics. Indeed, the fluorescence in situ hybridization test using MD Williams-Beuren Kreatech probe, specific for the ELN locus 7q11, was performed. The FISH generated one ELN signal in 20 metaphases read and found the presence of deletion of ELN locus, compatible with Williams-Beuren syndrome. The diagnosis of Williams-Beuren syndrome was made, and the patient is under observation, with a decline of eight months."
