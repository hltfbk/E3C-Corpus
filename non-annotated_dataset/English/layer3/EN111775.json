  "text": "A healthy 33-year-old Caucasian patient (gravida 2, para 2) had two episodes of progressive focal neurological deficits during postpartum periods. Signs and symptoms included right-sided dysmetria, adiadochokinesia, weakness, ataxia, and photophobia. MRI revealed rhombencephalitis involving the mesencephalon of the brainstem. Extensive and comprehensive investigations using blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were consistently positive only for ACA. The first episode was successfully treated with empiric antimicrobial agents and steroid. Given the negative infectious work up with the prior episode and the nearly identical clinical presentations, the second episode was treated with corticosteroid only. This led to complete resolution of her symptoms and reversal of the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions."
