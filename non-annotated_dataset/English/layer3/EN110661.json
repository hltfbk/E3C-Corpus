  "text": "A 43-year-old female diagnosed with metastatic leiomyosarcoma of unknown primary presented with a mild rash in sun-exposed areas of her face and upper chest, with no other neuromuscular symptoms. This rash resolved with systemic treatment with doxorubicin for metastatic leiomyosarcoma. Imaging assessment confirmed overall stable disease after chemotherapy completion. She presented acutely 2Â months later with new onset rash in a shawl-like distribution, periorbital oedema and proximal muscle weakness. Based on the characteristic cutaneous signs and symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, abnormal electromyography and raised skeletal muscle enzymes with a positive anti-transcription intermediary factor-1 gamma antibody result, a diagnosis of paraneoplastic dermatomyositis was made. Re-evaluation of her metastatic leiomyosarcoma revealed disease progression. Second-line chemotherapy was commenced once the dermatomyositis was controlled on steroid therapy. Systemic anti-cancer therapy was again associated with mild improvement in dermatomyositis symptoms."
