  "text": "A technetium-99 scan was performed in an 18-year-old man with abdominal pain, vomiting and rectal bleeding to confirm the presence of a Meckel's diverticulum which was not diagnosed laparoscopically elsewhere. The technetium-99 scan was positive and a diagnostic laparoscopy was re-performed which revealed a Meckel's diverticulum that was subsequently resected."
