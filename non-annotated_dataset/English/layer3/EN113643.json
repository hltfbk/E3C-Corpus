  "text": "A 69-year-old male treated for hypertension was found to have a left supra-renal mass (5.8 × 5.2 cm) by abdominal computed tomography. His laboratory data showed that his plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was within the normal range, but his plasma renin activity (PRA) was reduced, resulting in an increased aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR). Load tests of captopril or furosemide in the standing position demonstrated autonomous aldosterone secretion and renin suppression. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) with ACTH stimulation indicated bilateral hypersecretion of aldosterone. A left supra-renal tumor was resected because of the possibility of malignancy and was found to be a benign schwannoma arising from the juxta-adrenal region together with an adrenal gland. The dissected left adrenal gland was morphologically hyperplastic in the zona glomerulosa, but was immunohistochemically negative for CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase). Multiple CYP11B2-positive adrenocortical micronodules were detected in the adrenal gland, indicating micronodular hyperplasia. Although bilateral aldosteronism was indicated by AVS before the operation, the PRA, PAC and ARR values were within their respective reference ranges after resection of the unilateral tumor, suggesting that the slight increase in hormone secretion from the remaining right-sided lesion could not be detected after resection."
