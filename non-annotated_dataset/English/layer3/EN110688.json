  "text": "We report a rare five testicles in the genital area of a 13-month-old baby. The initial diagnosis was undescended testis (UDT) based on ultrasound findings where a testis in the abdomen and a testis in the inguinal canal were detected. Surgery with general anaesthesia was performed to diagnose and treat this case. Before surgery, four HCG 1200u injections were administered. During the operation, it was determined that the case had had five testicles. Testicles were on the left in the proximal inguinal canal, and the sac hernia was ligated parallel to the inner ring. The patient was followed up several times after surgery by a urologist, and the results showed that there were no problems, and the intervention was uncomplicated."
