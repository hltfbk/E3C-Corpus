  "text": "A 68-year-old man, without any past medical or surgical history, presented to general surgery clinic for an uncomplicated umbilical hernia evolving for five years. Clinical findings : physical examination showed an umbilical mass measuring about 4 cm. It was painless and utterly reducible with an expansile cough impulse. Otherwise, the abdomen was soft, with no guarding or tenderness. Timeline : as part of the preoperative check-up, an abdominal ultrasound was performed. The latter did not visualize the gallbladder clearly, and this suggested the presence of a sclerotic or atrophied gallbladder. The biliary tree was normal, however. Reinterviewing the patient, he did not have any history of right upper quadrant pain or episodes of fever and jaundice. Diagnostic assessment : biological findings were within normal limits; notably, liver function tests were unremarkable. A further investigation with an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed but failed to identify the gallbladder.\nFurthermore, there were no abnormalities detected in the biliary tract and the common bile duct measured 5 mm in diameter. Given non-visualization of the gallbladder on both ultrasound and CT scan, an MRCP was subsequently performed, revealing the absence of both the gallbladder and cystic duct. Then MRCP confirmed the diagnosis of gallbladder agenesis and ruled out an ectopic gallbladder. Therapeutic intervention : since the patient was asymptomatic, no further management was required. He was then operated on for his umbilical hernia. Follow-up and outcomes : the postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient remained symptom-free during a total follow up of two years."
