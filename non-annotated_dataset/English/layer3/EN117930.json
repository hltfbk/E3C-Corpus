  "text": "A 45-year-old woman presented to our outpatient clinic with a 1-year history of progressive dyspnea. At the age of 37 years, based on clinical and radiological features, our patient was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A family history showed that of five deceased siblings, four had died of disease of undetermined etiology. In addition, we screened other family members, and three were shown to have clinical, radiological, and pathological features consistent with interstitial pneumonia."
