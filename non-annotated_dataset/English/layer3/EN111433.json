  "text": "Here, we report a rare case of simultaneous breast and pulmonary paragonimiasis in a woman presenting painless breast mass and lung nodule with a history of eating raw trout. To confirm the diagnosis, serologic testing and tissue confirmation of the breast mass were performed. The patient was treated with surgical resection of the mass and praziquantel medication."
