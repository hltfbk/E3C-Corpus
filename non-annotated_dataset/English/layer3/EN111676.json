  "text": "A 49-year-old female presented at the hospital with a one-year history of a vulvar lump. The sonography of the lump showed several subcutaneous fluid-filled regions from the left vulva to the pubic symphysis, which suggested possible fat liquefaction. An enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a cystic area, which was considered a benign lesion. Intraoperative observations showed that the mass did not have an obvious capsule, the subcutaneous tissue presented as a cavity, and some yellow material came out of this cavity. A culture of the drainage did not show bacterial contamination. Histopathology revealed a foreign body granuloma. After resection and closed drainage, lumps were successively observed in the left lower abdomen and the bilateral hypochondriac region with infections. Sonography found that the hypoechoic areas in the bilateral hypochondriac region seemed continuous with deep in the breasts. The patient reported that she had undergone surgery with PAAG injections 20 years ago after she was repeatedly asked about her past history. Finally, a diagnosis of distant migration of PAAG was made."
