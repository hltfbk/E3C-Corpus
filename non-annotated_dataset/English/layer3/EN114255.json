  "text": "A 60-year-old woman presented to us with pain over medial aspect of right knee joint. She underwent open reduction and internal fixation for a patellar fracture which she sustained 4 years back and subsequently underwent kirschner wire(k wire) removal for the same around 2 years back. X-rays of the knee joint shows that the circlage wire used in tension band construct which was left in place had broken into multiple pieces and was lying in the soft tissue envelope surrounding the knee joint and one piece migrate to the popliteal fossa. On examination patient did not had distal neuro-vascular deficit. The pain of the patient was due to the osteo-arthritic changes in her medial side of knee joint rather than broken wire pieces. Patient was advised to undergo total knee replacement along with subsequent removal of broken wires but patient refused for any type of surgery and is kept on regular follow up."
