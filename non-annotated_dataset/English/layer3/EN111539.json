  "text": "A 31-year-old woman in week 15 of pregnancy complained of epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. Clinical diagnosis was severe hyperemesis gravidarum. Because the symptoms persisted during hospitalization, CT was performed and revealed dilated small bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels. In the right mid-abdomen, there was a large part of air containing a cavity connected to the small intestine, which was considered a dilated bowel loop. Emergency laparotomy was performed and axial torsion of a large Meckel's diverticulum measuring 11 cm was found at a few centimeters proximal to the ileocecal valve. Ileocecal resection including Meckel's diverticulum was performed. The postoperative course was uneventful. At 40 weeks gestation, she had vaginal delivery of normal baby."
