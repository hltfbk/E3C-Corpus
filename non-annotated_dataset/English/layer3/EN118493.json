  "text": "On questioning, patient admitted she did not cooperate during intravenous administration of Tc-99m-pertechnetate. Based on the abrupt onset of lesions and the absence of cooperation during intravenous administration of radiotracer, a suspect diagnosis of technetium and blood extravasation was made. This entity was confirmed in basis of evolution, with a spontaneous resolution of lesions within the next 15 days with no complications."
