  "text": "A 65-year-old Saudi woman presented with 6 months history of painful posterior scalp lump, 7 years after initial diagnosis of PTC. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed occipitoparietal calvarial lesion with massive intracranial extension. Another para-sagittal lesion was found at the top of corpus callosum mimicking a meningioma. Histopathology of para-sagittal lesion and the biopsy of calvarial mass confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic PTC. After surgical resection, residual tumors were treated with postoperative intensity-modulated radiation therapy. At 13 months of follow-up, patient was alive and without any signs of recurrence."
