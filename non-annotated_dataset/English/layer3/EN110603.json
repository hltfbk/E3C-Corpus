  "text": "A 61-year-old male comes with a complaint of right hip pain who has been diagnosed in some other clinic as a case of osteopoikilosis after an X-ray of the pelvis with both hips. However, on the further skeletal analysis found to involve most of the skeletal system with the diffuse osteolytic lesion. A bone scan, lab investigations helped in the arrival of diagnosis of atypical prostatic metastasis."
