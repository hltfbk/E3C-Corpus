  "text": "Here we describe a compound heterozygote in LYST gene, which was identified in a 4-year-old female patient. The patient showed skin hypopigmentation, sensitivity to light, mild splenomegaly and reduction of platelets in clinical examination. Giant intracytoplasmic inclusions were observed in the bone marrow examination, suggesting the diagnosis of CHS. Amplicon sequencing was performed to detect pathogenic mutation in LYST gene. The result was confirmed by two-generation pedigree analysis base on sanger sequencing."
