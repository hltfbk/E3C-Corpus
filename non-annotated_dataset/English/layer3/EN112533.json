  "text": "The advanced lung cancer was treated with pembrolizumab, and partial response was achieved in 3 months. However, the mediastinal cyst enlarged rapidly. We resected the mediastinal tumor and diagnosed it as myxofibrosarcoma. The postoperative course was uneventful. Immunotherapy was resumed after the operation without any adverse effects. No recurrence of mediastinal sarcoma or progression of lung cancer was found until the patient died in an accident 8 months after surgery."
