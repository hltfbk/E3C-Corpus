  "text": "A 91-year-old Japanese woman with a past medical history of angina pectoris, hypertension and uterine carcinoma noted bilateral axillary pain and presented herself to an emergency room. Although the pain improved and she went home, there were several subsequent episodes of recurrent chest pain. At approximately 1 week after the onset, she was hospitalized as her symptom worsened. Electrocardiography showed low voltage in limb and chest leads, and ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF and V3 to V6. Echocardiography revealed medial to apical dyskinesia and basal hypercontractility of the left ventricle, and cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis improved the symptom, but not her cardiac dysfunction. At 3 days after her admission, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed due to ventricular fibrillation. She died on the 5th day of admission (2 weeks after the onset). At autopsy, the left ventricle was dilatated and the apical ventricular wall was thin. On microscopy, remarkable wavy change and thinning of myocardium were diffusely observed, especially at the apex and the anterior to lateral wall of the left ventricle, interventricular septum and right ventricle, intermingled with interstitial fibrosis, hemorrhage and neutrophil infiltration. Contraction band necrosis was mainly observed on the posterior to inferior wall of the left ventricle."
