  "text": "A 68-year-old Asian male with JAK2 V617F mutation developed four different hematologic and non-hematologic neoplastic processes. In 2009, he was diagnosed with stage IA lung adenocarcinoma and also noted to have worsening leukocytosis and thrombocytosis with peak platelet count of 1,054,000/mL). Bone marrow biopsy was consistent with myeloproliferative neoplasm. His monocyte percentage increased in 2011 and met criteria for chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In 2013, he was admitted for proximal small bowel obstruction, with biopsy confirming stage IE diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In 2014, a bone marrow biopsy performed for worsening leukocytosis was consistent with acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic differentiation."
