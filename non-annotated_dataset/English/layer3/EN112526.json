  "text": "We present the case of a man who at the age of 66.0 years was diagnosed with Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS). In addition to watery diarrhea, alopecia, and a complete loss of toenails and fingernails, the patient had been suffering from dysgeusia and rapid weight loss of more than 10.0 kg within a few months. The patient had recently incurred a distal radius fracture. During the initial endoscopy an extensive polyposis of the stomach and jejunum was found. The diagnosis of CCS was made and after initiation of a steroid therapy his diarrhea improved immediately. A discontinuation of the steroid therapy was not possible and mesalazine (1000 mg t.i.d.) was added to prednisolone (10.0 mg/d). This therapy led to a remission within 6.0 months with weight gain and normalization of serum albumin levels. The prednisolone dose was reduced to 7.5 mg/d. During the following year, the steroids could be further reduced and nails had regrown again. Within three years, all polyps had disappeared and the steroid therapy was finished while the dosage of mesalazine was reduced in a stepwise fashion. Four years later, the mesalazine was stopped and more than 14.0 years after the initial diagnosis the patient is still in complete remission without any treatment."
