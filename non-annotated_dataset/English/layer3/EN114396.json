  "text": "A 60-year-old male presented with a history of a slowly progressing mass in the right lacrimal caruncle since several years before his initial visit. At the first examination, a yellowish, relatively smooth surface mass was observed in the right lacrimal caruncle. The caruncular mass was completely removed under local anesthesia. The pathological findings of this mass were consistent with a steatocystoma. At the 6-month follow-up, there was no sign of recurrence or development of the steatocystoma or any other masses."
