  "text": "A 25 year old girl presented with severe amitriptyline poisoning causing pulseless VT and prolonged cardiac arrest. After 3 h of uninterrupted external cardiac massage, together with nine DC shocks and intra venous bicarbonate injections the rhythm reverted to a nodal tachycardia, initial 2D echocardiogram showed left ventricular dysfunction, which recovered to normal after 2 weeks and the patient had a complete recovery subsequently."
