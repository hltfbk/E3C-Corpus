  "text": "An elderly male farmer presented to us with an insidious onset of painless swelling in his left lower limb which gradually progressive. At the time of presentation it had involved his entire limb. A hard palpable mass of size 5 * 4 cms was detected in the left iliac fossa and a testicular enlargement was noted on the left side. The ultrasound of the testes showed that the left testis was enlarged 3.9*3*3.2 cms showing diffusely heterogenous echo-texture and irregular nodular surface with irregular hypoechoic thickening of the scrotal wall with left sided hydrocele. A separate hypoechoic *1.2 cms lesion was visualized in the anterior scrotal wall. FNAC from the scrotal mass showed tumour cells of simialr morphology present singly in monolayered sheets and in three dimensional fragments. The overall immunomorphological features suggested a malignant mesothelioma likely to have arisen from the tunica vaginalis."
