  "text": "We report a case of iliopsoas pyomyositis in a 25-year-old Greek Caucasian woman with a history of intravenous drug use. Her condition was complicated by bilateral dilation of the ureters and renal calyces as a result of mechanical pressure from inflammation and edema of the involved muscle. The patient did not present aggravation of renal function and was treated successfully solely with intravenous antibiotics, without surgical intervention. This is the first case report describing iliopsoas pyomyositis with reversible bilateral dilation of the urinary tract that was treated successfully with intravenous antibiotics, without surgical intervention."
