  "text": "A 39-year-old right-handed woman with a history of CD was referred to our hospital with etiologically unexplained Gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing cortical lesions, triggering epileptic seizures. A CT-scan of the thorax and bronchoalveolar lavage found no signs of sarcoidosis. Lumbar punctures and laboratory testing found no underlying infection or coincidental autoimmune disorders and MRI-scans showed progression of lesion load. Consequently, the patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of a cortical lesion. Histological examination revealed a mixed lympho-histiocytic and tuberculoid granulomatous inflammation surrounding small vessels and no signs for infection. After exclusion of other granulomatous diseases and the typical histological findings we diagnosed a cerebral granulomatosis as a manifestation of CD. The patient was initially started on azathioprine, which had to be switched to corticosteroids and methotrexate because of an azathioprine related pancreatitis. The patient has not suffered any further epileptic seizures to date."
