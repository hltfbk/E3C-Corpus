  "text": "We describe the case of 44â€‰year old Pakistani woman, presenting with stage four non-proteinuric chronic kidney disease, and a brother on dialysis. Renal biopsy demonstrated KIN and concurrent ALECT2. Genetic sequencing identified a novel FAN1 mutation as the cause of her KIN and she is being managed conservatively for chronic kidney disease. Her brother also had KIN with no evidence of amyloidosis and is being worked up for kidney transplantation."
