  "text": "We report a patient who developed an unusual central retinal artery occlusion with unilateral blindness following nasal surgery under general anesthesia. A 45-year-old man underwent a nasal septal surgery for severe epistaxis. Soon after recovery, the patient noticed loss of vision in his right eye and was unable to lift his upper eyelid. Upon ophthalmic examinations, we determined that he had right-sided third cranial nerve palsy with central retinal artery obstruction and ptosis of right upper eyelid, restriction of ocular movements, and no perception of light in the right eye. Postoperative computerized tomography scan revealed multiple fractures of the left medial orbital wall, including one near the optic canal. Ptosis and ocular defects were recovered partially, but visual loss persisted until the last follow-up."
