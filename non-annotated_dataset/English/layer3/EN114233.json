  "text": "Herein, we report a rare case of disseminated pulmonary nocardiosis with cerebral manifestation in a 66Â year-old-Nepali farmer; with a history of renal transplantation and undergoing therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. Radiographic imaging revealed multiple opacities of varying sizes in bilateral lung field mediastinal, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and ill-defined lesion with surrounding edema seen in left occipitoparietal region of brain. Bacteriological assessments of bronchoalveolar lavage and purulent fluid extracted intra-operatively from the lesion confirmed the case as Nocardiosis."
