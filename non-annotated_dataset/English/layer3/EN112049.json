  "text": "An 85-year-old man, who underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for stage IIIa sigmoid colon cancer 10 months ago, was referred to our hospital with complaints of a growing mass in the abdominal wall. The tumor was palpable at the right-sided abdominal wall corresponding to the port site of laparoscopic sigmoidectomy. The tumor rapidly grew for 2 months. Computed tomography showed a ring-enhanced mass at the right-sided abdominal wall. PET examination revealed high accumulation of FDG in the tumor. Tumor resection was performed due to suspected port site recurrence. The pathological diagnosis was inflammatory granuloma, so-called Schloffer tumor."
