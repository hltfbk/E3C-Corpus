  "text": "A 22-year-old man complained of left eyelid swelling, eye redness, visual decrease and occasional headache after motor vehicle accident 4Â months prior during which he experienced a head injury. He was initially thought to have glaucoma, but he was finally diagnosed with a right CCF based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Timely embolization surgery resulted in obvious relief of the ocular symptoms and an improved prognosis."
