  "text": "A 70-year-old man with chronic limb-threatening ischemia and foot gangrene had undergone bypass surgery from the left common femoral artery to the dorsalis pedis artery 2 years earlier. We evaluated the bypass graft using ultrasonography and found stenosis around the proximal anastomotic site, presumably due to IH. POBA was performed every 3 months due to the repeated re-stenosis of the lesion. Since using the DCB, no restenosis has been detected to date (10 months)."
