  "text": "A 36-year-old white man diagnosed 29 months previously as having 1p/19q codeleted anaplastic oligodendroglioma presented bilateral cruralgia and lower limb motor deficits. A computed tomography scan showed multiple osteoblastic bone lesions. The presence of oligodendroglial cells was revealed by bone marrow biopsy and confirmed by immunohistochemical analyses. A positon emission tomography-computed tomography scan confirmed the exclusive involvement of bones."
