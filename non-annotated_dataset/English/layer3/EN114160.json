  "text": "A 21-year-old man, who had GBM 7 years ago complained of a transient shadow in his vision and presented with normal visual acuity but optic disc edema and an enlarged blind spot in the right eye (oculus dexter, OD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a right intraorbital optic nerve tumor without a brain lesion. Chiasm involvement and severe vision deterioration occurred 3 months later. A biopsy of the right optic nerve revealed glioblastoma. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) prevented involvement of the fellow eye 1 year after symptom onset."
