  "text": "We report the case of a 74-year-old Armenian woman who received capecitabine as adjuvant treatment for colon cancer and subsequently developed abnormal liver biochemical tests and radiographic findings in keeping with hepatic steatosis. There was complete reversal of liver enzyme abnormalities with discontinuation of the drug and this patient represents a case of reversible liver injury due to capecitabine."
