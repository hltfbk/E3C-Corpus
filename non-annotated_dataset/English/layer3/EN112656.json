  "text": "A Chinese boy had his first attack of severe hypovolaemic shock that responded to fluid resuscitation when he was 6 years of age. His second attack developed at 8 years of age. He was then transferred to our cardiac unit for refractory hypotensive shock. The patient's echocardiogram revealed ventricular wall thickening with significant cardiac dysfunction requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Subsequently, he made a full recovery, including his myocardial wall thickness and function. The echocardiographic findings suggested myocardial oedema that was transient in nature. Clinical and laboratory investigation from both episodes were compatible with ISCLS."
