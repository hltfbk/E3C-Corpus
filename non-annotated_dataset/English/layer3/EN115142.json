  "text": "Here, we present the case of an otherwise healthy 23-year-old Caucasian man who presented to the Emergency Department at our institution and was found to have both subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum as a result of cocaine use. His only presenting symptom was mild chest pain and he had palpable subcutaneous crepitations. He underwent a series of investigations including a chest radiograph and computed tomography as well as a barium fluoroscopy study to rule out secondary pneumomediastinum, which can be fatal. There were no other pulmonary features of illicit drug use, such as granulomas or fibrosis, seen on radiological imaging. He was subsequently managed with a period of observation and supportive care."
