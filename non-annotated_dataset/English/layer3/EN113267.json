  "text": "A 76-year-old man was diagnosed with pulmonary adenocarcinoma with pleural dissemination and liver and adrenal metastases. Genomic analysis revealed neither EGFR mutations nor ALK translocations. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a programmed death-ligand 1 tumor proportion score of 23%. Chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab resulted in Grade 3 skin eruption and disease progression. Pembrolizumab was initiated as a second-line treatment. However, peritoneal dissemination and ascites developed. The patient died 2Â weeks later. The autopsy revealed widespread peritoneal dissemination and an extensive hemorrhagic infarction."
