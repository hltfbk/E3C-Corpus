  "text": "We describe a 60-year-old male who presented with rapidly progressive intermittent claudication of his right leg. He did not have any significant atherosclerotic risk factors. He had recent onset hypertension and loss of weight. He also had mononeuropathy of right common peroneal nerve and livedo reticularis rash. With negative autoimmune markers and suggestive histology in deep punch skin biopsy and angiographic evidence of segmental stenosis of femoral and renal arteries, we diagnosed PAN. We treated him with aggressive immunosuppressants and vascular bypass surgery of right femoral vessels; he showed a good response."
