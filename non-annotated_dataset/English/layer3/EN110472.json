  "text": "Case 1: an 18-year-old unmarried school going female patient, reported to the outpatient Department of Oral Medicine and Maxillofacial Radiology with a chief complaint of unerupted upper front permanent teeth. She was moderately built and nourished with a short stature, she revealed no significant systemic illness with no deleterious and par-functional habits. On general physical examination the patient was well oriented, conscious she had very thin eyebrows, there was no history of heat intolerance or problems in sweating, she had spoon-shaped slow-growing small fingernails with onychorrhexis with deformed toenails. History revealed that her nails had improved with age but were small and discolored at birth. The patient's family history revealed that her younger sister has a similar problem. On intra oral examination generalized missing permanent teeth with retained deciduous teeth with severe attrition was noticed. Generalized pit and fissure caries was noticed on all the posterior teeth one deep caries was noticed with left maxillary anterior teeth. Maxillary palatine tori noticed with poor gingival and periodontal condition, oral mucosa was normal. Investigation: panoramic radiograph confirmed the clinical data, showed periapical infection with right maxillary anterior teeth, generalised absence of permanent tooth bud in both maxillary and mandibular arch was shocking. Case 2: a 14-year-old school going girl, sibling of the case 1, was examined after clinical examination of her elder sister, she was moderately built and nourished for her age, she revealed no significant systemic illness with no deleterious and par-functional habits. On general physical examination the patient was well oriented and conscious, she had similar spoon-shaped slow-growing small fragile fingernails with onychorrhexis with deformed toenails like her elder sister which was better compared to before. On intra oral examination generalized missing permanent teeth with retained deciduous teeth was noticed. Generalized pit and fissure caries on posterior teeth with one deep caries with right mandibular posterior teeth. Maxillary palatine tori was also common with poor periodontal condition having generalized stains and calculus, oral mucosa was normal. Investigation: panoramic radiograph showed generalized missing of permanent tooth bud in both maxillary and mandibular arch. Based on family history, clinical, and radiological findings, a provisional diagnosis of partial anodontia was given considering mesoectodermal dysplasia, ectodermal dysplasia and tooth and nail syndrome (nail dysplasia with hypodontia) in differential diagnosis. Genetic investigation DNA extraction: 5 ml of blood sample was collected from the median cubital vein of the patients. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes using the standard Qiagen blood DNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's protocol. Sanger sequencing: in order to validate the identified MSX1 mutation, primers were designed using the Primer3 tool for MSX1 exon 1; forward primer (5' -CTGGCCTCGCCTTAT TAG C 3') and reverse primer (5'-GCCTGGGTTCTGGCTCTC 3'). A standard PCR was performed and the products were sequenced using Sanger sequencing through ABI 3500xl genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA USA). Result: the present work is intended to identify the involvement of MSX1 gene variants in familial hypodontia. MSX1 is a vital gene in tooth development. The DNA sequences were analyzed and compared with DNA reference using DNASTAR alignment software (Madison, WI 53705 USA); meanwhile chromatograms were also viewed and analyzed using Sequence Scanner software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA USA). We have observed one point mutation on exon 1 of MSX1 (1A;c.731G > A). We observed that MSX1 is contributing to cause hypodontia. In the present study, MSX1 gene is mutated in familial hypodontia; however, the mutation of MSX1 alone might not cause phenotype change to the patient. Few other genes and mutation is the more predominant factor which might be contributing to hypodontia compared to MSX1. This can be identified by analysing whole exome or whole genome sequencing of the patient samples."
