  "text": "Here, we report a case of an asymptomatic 61-year-old female misdiagnosed as solitary fibrous tumor of posterior mediastinum which was revealed to have blood stained pleural effusion during the video-assisted thoracic surgery. Eventually pathological study and immunohistochemistry profile of the tumor was reported as benign schwannoma."
