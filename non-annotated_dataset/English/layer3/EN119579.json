  "text": "A 60-year-old patient presented with 6 months history of increasing difficulty in micturition. On digital rectal examination prostate was hard and nodular and estimated weight was 50-gram. His serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 150 ng/ml. Clinically a locally advanced carcinoma of prostate was suspected. In view of severe obstructive urinary symptoms and significant post-micturition residual urine, transurethral resection of prostate was carried out. Histopathological examination of resected prostatic tissue revealed xanthogranulomatous prostatitis with no evidence of malignancy. Patient remains symptom free at 16 months follow-up and serum PSA has decreased to 6 ng/ml."
