  "text": "A 48-year-old woman was admitted to West China Hospital of Sichuan University, presenting with fatigue, whole body edema for 1 year, alopecia and skin pigmentation for 5 months. Hormonal profiles including plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) measurements and low-dose dexamethasone inhibition test suggested that the patient had Cushing's syndrome. However, during tumor location phase, the results of high-dose dexamethasone inhibition test (HDDST) contradicted desmopressin (DDAVP) stimulation test. Thus, BIPSS was employed, and its results indicated a pituitary origin. Interestingly, MRI of sellar region showed an innocent pituitary but caught a serendipitous lesion in the lateral rectus muscle of left eye, which was later proved to be an orbital neuroendocrine tumor secreting ACTH by pathological and immunohistochemical results. ACTH level of the patients was < 0.1 ng/L and cortisol level was 51.61 nmol/L 1 week after surgery. At 24 months follow-up, the patient appeared stable with no complaints nor any symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, including moon face, purple striate and central obesity. The patient's life quality also improved significantly."
