  "text": "An 11-year-old boy was referred to our clinic due to the persistence of the lower deciduous molars. The further diagnosis revealed bilateral keratocystic odontogenic tumors in the region of teeth 33 and 45 representing a symptom of a Gorlin-Goltz syndrome. This case of the oral rehabilitation of an adolescent with bilateral keratocystic odontogenic tumors shows the approach of a multidisciplinary treatment concept including the following elements: Enucleation and bone defect augmentation using a prefabricated bone graft; distraction osteogenesis to extend the graft-block vertically after cessation of growth; accompanying orthodontic treatment, guided implant placement and prosthetic rehabilitation. Six months after implant insertion, a new keratocystic odontogenic tumor in the basal part of the left sinus maxillaris had to be removed combined with the closure of the oroantral fistula. During the follow-up period of 18 months in semi-annual intervals, the patient showed no sign of pathology."
