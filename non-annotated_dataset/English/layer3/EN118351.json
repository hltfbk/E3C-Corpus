  "text": "We report a case of a 66-year-old female with systemic symptoms and bilateral cervical lymph nodes which were initially diagnosed as the hyaline vascular variant of Castleman's disease and two years later after the initial diagnosis she was confirmed to B cell lymphoma. Following the treatment with radiation therapy to the cervical area and combination chemotherapy complete response was achieved."
