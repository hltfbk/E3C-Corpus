  "text": "An 80-year-old female presented with pancytopenia and was diagnosed with MDS. Over time, she required hospitalizations for platelet transfusions with increased frequency. She developed fatigue and weakness along with gastrointestinal symptoms. On exam, she had diffuse abdominal tenderness and a maculopapular rash. Her lab results revealed a new basophilia. A bone marrow biopsy showed 100% cellularity with many aggregates of mast cells. Chromosomal analysis showed t(9;22) with confirmed BCR/ABL1 fusion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)."
