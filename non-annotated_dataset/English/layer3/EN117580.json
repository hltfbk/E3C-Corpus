  "text": "A 55-year-old Turkish woman presented with a two-year history of persistent hoarseness. Endoscopic laryngeal examination and computed tomography revealed a supraglottic mass. Direct laryngoscopy was performed and a biopsy taken. Results of the histopathologic examination and immunohistochemical analysis were consistent with typical carcinoid tumor of the larynx. A supraglottic laryngectomy was performed. There was no recurrence during a follow-up period of three years."
