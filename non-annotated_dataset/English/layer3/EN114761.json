  "text": "We report the case of a Caucasian male infant diagnosed shortly after birth with neonatal diabetes, truncus arteriosus type III, ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, an absent gallbladder and a right inguinal hernia. His diabetes resulted from a de novo mutation of the GATA6 gene resulting in pancreatic hypoplasia. At 20 months of age he developed protein losing enteropathy. This has not previously been associated with GATA6 mutations and it is not known if this association is causal."
