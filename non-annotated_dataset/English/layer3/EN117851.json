  "text": "The patient is a 26-year-old Caucasian Greek male who was presented in the emergency department with acute chest pain. Computerized tomography with contrast material showed the presence of an ascending aortic aneurysm with the question of an acute dissection type A (De Bakey II). The patient was emergently operated with replacement of the affected aortic segment and he had an uneventful clinical course. Three years follow up is essentially normal."
