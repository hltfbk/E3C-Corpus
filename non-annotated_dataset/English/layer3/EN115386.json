  "text": "A 51-year old Caucasian non-smoking female police officer presented with a chronic cough. She had been diagnosed with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia in 1992. She complained of a severe, dry cough at the time of the diagnosis and a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation in the upper left lobe as demonstrated by CT of the chest. The fistula was occluded and the cough disappeared rapidly but resumed in 1994. Recanalisation of the fistula led to a new embolisation procedure, and the cough disappeared. Similar episodes occurred in 1998 and 2004, leading to embolisation of a fistula in the right lower lobe and reperfused fistula in the upper left lobe, respectively. The patient was referred to our research team in 2010 because of reappearance of her dry cough that was more pronounced during exercise and exposure to volatile irritants, and absent during the night. Despite extensive investigations, no cause was found other than reperfusion of the fistula in the left upper lobe. The malformation was not accessible to embolisation, leading us to recommend surgical excision of the malformation. A surgeon undertook atypical resection of the left upper lobe in 2012. The cough disappeared immediately after surgery and has not recurred."
