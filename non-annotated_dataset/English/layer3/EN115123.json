  "text": "A 55-year-old caucasian woman presented recurrent keloids on a presternal scar. Standard surgical intervention was used to treat the scar. However, this was unsuccessful and a year later the patient sought treatment again, but only by alternative means as the patient refused further surgical intervention. Consequently, based on past research and experience, the authors attempted to treat these lesions with ingenol mebutate gel, due to the pro-apoptotic effects."
