  "text": "Here we report a case of a 69-year-old Caucasian man who presented to the emergency department after a fall. He had 1-year history of syncope and bradycardia with frequent ectopic beats shown on his electrocardiogram. He had no neurological symptoms. He was previously investigated as an out-patient and a diagnosis of idiopathic bradycardia with ventricular ectopic beats was made. On admission, cardiovascular investigations could not reveal the cause of his bradycardia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans of his head showed a localized mass in left basal ganglia consistent with infiltrating glioma."
