  "text": "A case of massive splenomegaly with anaemia referred for investigations at the haematology clinic at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital is described.\nHE is a 15-year-old female who presented with a mass in the left hypochondrial region of six months duration. The mass was gradually growing in size. There was no associated fever, night sweats, recurrent respiratory tract infections or weight loss.\nHer past medical history was unremarkable. She had her menarche at 13 years and menstrual loss is over a period of 4 days. She denied menorrhagia. She was not on any regular medication. There was no past history of blood transfusion.\nOn examination, she looked well. She had mild pallor but was anicteric. There was no lymphadenopathy. She had splenomegaly palpable 10 cm below the left costal margin. There was no other palpable abdominal mass. There was no ascites.\nShe had a soft ejection systolic murmur at the mitral area. No other abnormalities were detected on examination.\nTable 1 details the results of laboratory investigations performed. HE had microcytic hypochromic anaemia with a high RDW. She also had a mild thrombocytopenia with normal leucocyte count and a raised reticulocyte count. The iron studies were however normal. Quantification of haemoglobin fractions was by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) using a Bio-Rad variant II system. We were unable to perform tests to determine the alpha-beta chain synthesis ratio or do genetic tests of the beta-globin cluster (using Southern blot or PCR assay tests) due to technical and logistic challenges.\nThe possible diagnoses for HE include\n- β 0 thalassaemia/hereditary persistence of haemoglobin F or δβ 0 thalassemia/hereditary persistence of haemoglobin F\n- HMS\nShe was treated presumptively for HMS with Proguanil 200 mg daily.\nShe was reviewed monthly and she showed consistent reduction in spleen size until the ninth month of therapy when the spleen was impalpable. Her haemoglobin improved slightly to 10.0g/dl and her platelet count increased to 210 x 109/l after 9 months of Proguanil and Folate therapy. Folate supplementation was necessary because of the inhibition of endogenous Folate synthesis by Proguanil. The good response to Proguanil confirmed a diagnosis of HMS and the results of the haemoglobin electrophoresis and quantification point to a diagnosis of β thalassemia."
