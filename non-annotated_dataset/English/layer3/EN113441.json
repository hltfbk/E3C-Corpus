  "text": "A 32-year-old man was admitted due to increasing urination frequency and palpable mass in right lower abdomen for 2 months. The mass was resected and diagnosed DSRCT. The patient refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy,and used Chinese medicine only. Six months after the surgery, the patient re-hospitalized due to growing abdominal mass and ascites. Intraperitoneal cisplatin treatment showed little effect. Apatinib was then recommended. Apatinib revealed outstanding effect on reducing mass size and ascites during 2-month treatment. Apatinib therapy continued for additional 2 months, and the patient was in good condition. The only toxicity was hand-food syndrome, which was controllable and well tolerated."
