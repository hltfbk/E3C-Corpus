  "text": "A 63-year-old man was admitted due to sudden onset of chest pain and was in a cardiogenic shock state. His ECG showed ST-segment elevation in precordial (V2-6) and inferior leads (II, III, and aVF) and ST-segment depression in lead aVR. Blood biochemistry showed that cardiac enzymes were not elevated. Ultrasonic cardiography showed that the left ventricular apical level was akinetic, papillary muscle level was severely hypokinetic, and basal level was hyperkinetic, mimicking TC. However, coronary angiogram showed total occlusion of his right coronary artery wrapping around the cardiac apex. Successful percutaneous coronary intervention reversed his critical status."
