  "text": "A 60-year-old man presented to our clinic with abdominal pain and vomiting that occurred suddenly after dinner. Three years before presentation, he had undergone radical thoracoscopic esophagectomy followed by reconstruction of the gastric conduit through the posterior sternum, for esophageal cancer. Enhanced computed tomography scans showed distension of only the gastric conduit without ischemia and distension of the small intestine. According to our findings, we initially diagnosed the patient with postoperative intestinal obstruction caused by adhesions. After conservative treatment failed, the patient underwent an endoscopic study that showed a bezoar at the pylorus ring. We initially failed to remove the bezoar endoscopically because of its large size; hence, we attempted enzymatic dissolution. Three days after the first endoscopic study, the bezoar was disintegrated using a snare and extracted during a second endoscopy. The patient recovered uneventfully and presented with no complications during the 1-year follow-up interval."
