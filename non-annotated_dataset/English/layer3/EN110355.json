  "text": "We report a case of a 30-year-old female para 2+0, gravida 3 at 35+1 who presented at a Tertiary facility in Eldoret Kenya with one-day history of per vaginal bleeding and 2 weeks' history of no fetal movements. The previous pregnancies were both spontaneous vertex delivery, no complications. On abdominal examination, the fundal height was 30 weeks, cephalic presentation, No fetal heart rate. There was no tenderness on abdominal examination. Fetal parts were not easily palpable. On speculum examination, slight blood oozing from the cervix. An impression of Antepartum hemorrhage (differential diagnosis of placenta Previa) with intrauterine fetal demise was made. Formal obstetric scan done showed Intrauterine fetal demise at 27+4 weeks, low lying placenta. Patient was admitted to the antenatal ward and decision to induce with Misoprostol was made. Patient received 5 doses of misoprostol (100mcg sublingual). The 4 th dose of misoprostol was given together with catheter (60mls of Normal saline). Once the catheter fell, the patient was transferred to the Labour ward floor, 2cm dilated and started on Oxytocin. There was no progress with oxytocin for 48 hrs. Decision to reevaluate the patient was made. A bedside obstetric ultrasound was done which showed empty uterus, chronic uterine rupture with differential diagnosis of abdominal pregnancy was made. Patient was taken to theatre for Explorative Laparotomy.\nIntraoperative findings: there was a cystic mass about 20*20cm extending from the pelvis to Epigastrium, brown in colour. The Mass was attached to the anterior abdominal wall and the mesentery posteriorly. The fallopian tubes were attached on either sides of the inferolateral aspect of the mass. The ovaries were partially attached to the inferior lateral aspect of the mass bilaterally. The greater omentum was partially attached to the superior aspect of the mass. The uterus was grossly normal and free. The stomach, bowel, liver and spleen were grossly normal. The cystic mass was easily separated by blind dissection from the anterior abdominal wall, the mesentery and the greater omentum. The ovaries were easily separated from the infero-lateral aspect of the mass. Bilateral partial salpingectomy was done since both the fallopian tubes were tightly adherent to the mass."
