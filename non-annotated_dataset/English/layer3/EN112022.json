  "text": "We report a child who initially presented with failure to thrive and mildly elevated transaminase levels and was determined to have pancreatic insufficiency due to SDS. During follow-up he had persistently elevated transaminase levels and developed hepatosplenomegaly. An investigation was performed to determine the etiology of ongoing liver injury, including a liver biopsy which revealed hepatic cirrhosis."
