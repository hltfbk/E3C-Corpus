  "text": "A 45-year-old woman presented decreased visual acuity in both eyes. Her best corrected visual acuity was 0.1 in the right eye and 0.15 in the left eye. Goldmann perimetry showed bilateral central scotomas and bitemporal visual field defects. MRI demonstrated a lesion with mixed hypo- and hyperintensity at the optic chiasm, which was thought to be an intratumoral hemorrhage. The patient underwent bifrontal craniotomy. The tumor was exposed via an anterior interhemispheric approach, and histological evaluation of the mass led to a diagnosis of cavernous angioma. Six months after the surgery, her best corrected visual acuity was 0.9 in the right eye and 0.9 in the left, with slight bitemporal visual field defects."
