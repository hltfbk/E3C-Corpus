  "text": "In this case report, we presented the management of a 7Â year old with left TMJ ankylosis discovered since infant. Clinical and imaging investigations were consistent with left temporomandibular joint ankylosis (Type IV) possible secondary to childhood septic arthritis. Left gap arthroplasty via modified Al Kayat Bramley and retromandibular approach was performed, with interpositional arthroplasty placement of temporalis fascia graft. No complications from the surgery except reduced mouth opening were seen. Possible contributing factors to this less than satisfactory mouth opening are adressed."
