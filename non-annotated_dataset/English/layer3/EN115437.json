  "text": "We described a 31-year-old male who presented with involuntary brief jerky movements of the left shoulder and arm with significant wasting of shoulder muscles. In retrospect, the patient had a progressive right leg weakness one year prior to his presentation. Needle electromyography confirmed the presence of rhythmic irregular burst discharges in motor units of muscles expanding from the third to the sixth cervical region with normal nerve conduction parameters. There was no evidence of cortically generated myoclonic jerks using time-locked electroencephalogram. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain and cervical cord along with the presence of oligoclonal bands in cerebral spinal fluid confirmed the diagnosis of MS. Based on the history and progressive clinical features, a diagnosis of primary progressive MS was established."
