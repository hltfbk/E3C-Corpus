  "text": "A 15-year-old boy was admitted to the emergency department following blunt abdominal trauma. The computed tomographic scan showed a traumatic rupture of the spleen and a 7-cm mass at the left side of the retroperitoneal space. Conservative treatment started and aborted after 4â€‰h due to the onset of haemodynamic instability. Splenectomy was performed. An accessory spleen was discovered. A second large mass in the retroperitoneum was diagnosed as a second large accessory spleen that was also left in place. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day. Seven months later, the CT scan showed viability of both accessory spleens."
