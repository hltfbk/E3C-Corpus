  "text": "A 66-year-old German woman presented in a university hospital with nasal obstruction. Clinically the patient showed nodular and ulcerative lesion at the nasal septum. Histology of the left nasal septum biopsy revealed necrosis, chronic inflammation and intracellular amastigote that was suggestive of leishmaniasis. The molecular-pathological detection of parasite DNA was positive for leishmania infantum. The medical history includes hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis for which she was under continuous immunosuppressive treatment with methotrexate and anti-TNF-blocker (HumiraÂ®) several years ago. Moreover, she was treated for cutaneous leishmaniasis in the left elbow after a travel history in Mallorca five years ago (4 weeks, amphotericin B). The patient successfully retreated as a case of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis receiving at first liposomal amphotericin B for 2 weeks. Under the treatment showed the patient an increased level of creatinine, therefore, the therapy was changed to a phospholipid (Hexadecylphosphocholin = MiltefosinÂ®) for 4 weeks with a side effect of vomiting. Follow up visits showed significant improvement with no recurrence."
