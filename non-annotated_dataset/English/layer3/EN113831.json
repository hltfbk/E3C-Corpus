  "text": "We report a 21-year-old woman with fibronectin glomerulopathy, who had been diagnosed with persistent cloaca and congenital esophageal atresia at birth. She developed proteinuria and hematuria 7 months before admission. Urinary protein and serum creatinine levels were 3.38 g/gCr and 0.73 mg/dL. Renal biopsy showed severe mesangial widening due to massive deposits, which was positive periodic acid-Schiff and negative methenamine silver. Immunostaining was negative for immunoglobulin but positive for fibronectin. Electron microscopy showed diffuse mesangial granular deposits. Thus she was diagnosed with fibronectin glomerulopathy, despite a negative family history of kidney disease and lack of any known missense mutations of fibronectin 1 gene."
