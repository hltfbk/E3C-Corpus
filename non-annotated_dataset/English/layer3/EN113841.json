  "text": "A 60-year-old female with thyroid papillary carcinoma (T4aN1bM0) initially underwent total thyroidectomy and paratracheal and selective neck dissections (D2a), with resectional management of recurrent laryngeal nerve, trachea, and esophagus. Three years later, she was diagnosed with left retropharyngeal and upper mediastinal lymph node metastases of papillary thyroid cancer. Transoral videolaryngoscopic surgery was performed with a combination of ultrasonography with a flexible laparoscopic transducer manipulated with forceps for identifying RPN intraoperatively. Due to the transducer's small size and thin, flexible cable, the transducer interrupted the procedure in spite of the narrowness of oral cavity. RPN was resected completely without adverse events."
