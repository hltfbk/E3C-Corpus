  "text": "We present two sequential cases (Patient 1: 26-year-old; Patient 2: 29-year-old) of postpartum tuberculosis with pulmonary and extrapulmonary lesions (Patient 1: peritonitis; Patient 2: psoas abscess secondary to spondylitis). Both cases progressed to PR (worsening of pre-existing lung infiltrations (Patients 1, 2) and new contralateral effusion (Patient 2)) in a relatively short time after initiation of treatment (Patient 1: 1 week; Patient 2: 3 weeks), suggesting that immune modulations during pregnancy and delivery may contribute to the pathogenesis of both disseminated tuberculosis and its PR. The pulmonary lesions and effusion of both cases gradually improved without change of chemotherapy regimen."
