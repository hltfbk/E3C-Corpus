  "text": "Here, we report a rare case of a 5-year-old male patient presented to the emergency room (ER) due to mass on the scrotum without the difficulty of urination. From clinical findings, mass with a size of 15 x 10 cm was found with multiple abscesses on both sides of the scrotum. Pathological Anatomy Examination confirmed yolk sac tumour present within the scrotal mass. Initially, palliative chemotherapy took place to reduce the growth rate of the tumour. However, due to the responsiveness of testicular cancer to chemotherapy drugs, it reduced into operable size testicular cancer. Wide excision and Orchidectomy was then performed, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy."
