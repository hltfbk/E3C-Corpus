  "text": "An 80-year-old Caucasian female with metastatic urothelial carcinoma failed first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine and carboplatin and second-line treatment with atezolizumab, an inhibitor of programmed cell death ligand 1. She developed hypothyroidism at completion of atezolizumab treatment and responded to levothyroxine. Subsequently she was enrolled to a phase II study and received AZD4547 due to an actionable mutation at FGFR3 found in tumor biopsy. Two months later, she experienced recurrent hypothyroidism symptoms, and was hospitalized twice for small bowel obstruction. Her thyroid stimulating hormone level was significantly increased to 2957 uIU/mL (reference range 0.8-7.7 uIU/mL). Her levothyroxine dose was increased accordingly. Her thyroid function returned to normal 1 month afterwards, and small bowel obstruction did not recur."
