  "text": "A 51-year-old male presented with a painless progressive swelling over the left cheek for nine months. It was diagnosed as a parotid cyst or a mucous retention cyst based upon the radiological and cytological features. The cyst was completely excised with transparotid and transoral approaches, and the final diagnosis was confirmed to be rhinosporidiosis."
