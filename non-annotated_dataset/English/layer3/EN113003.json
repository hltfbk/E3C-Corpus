  "text": "A 43-year-old Chinese woman with a five-year history of systemic lupus erythematous was diagnosed with colon cancer based on imaging test. A radical bowel resection was performed successfully. To avoid serious complications during surgery, prednisone was replaced with methylprednisolone therefore avoiding adrenal insufficiency. The patient was subsequently treated with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy and recovered well."
