  "text": "A 77-year-old man underwent PD for pancreatic cancer. On postoperative day 2, the patient developed a severe anemia with hypotension. The computed tomography showed acute ischemia of the jejunal loop due to thrombosis. The emergent surgery was performed. The removal of the ischemic intestine and re-anastomoses of the biliary and pancreatic ducts could be performed all at once because necrosis and inflammation were still very mild in early stage."
