  "text": "We report the case of a female Caucasian patient aged 67 years with vitreo-macular traction in the right eye, treated with Ocriplasmin, at the Eye Clinic of the Second University of Naples. Visual acuity was 20/20 before treatment, associated with metamorphopsia. Two weeks after injection, optical coherence tomography showed the release of vitreo-macular traction and multifocal electroretinogram responses showed a significant increase of retinal density responses in all six rings (p < 0.03). Visual acuity remained constant with resolution of symptoms and the appearance of vitreous floaters."
