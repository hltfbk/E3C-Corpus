  "text": "A 34-year-old man received hybrid surgery for C4-C5 and C5-C6 arthroplasty with Bryan discs and C6-C7 arthrodesis with polyetheretherketone cage due to traumatic herniation of the intervertebral disc (HIVD). After four years, cervical spine radiographs revealed severe HO around the Bryan discs over the C4-C5 and C5-C6 levels. The magnetic resonance image revealed HIVD over the C3-C4 level with spinal cord compression. Seronegative spondyloarthritis was diagnosed after consultation with a rheumatologist. A second CDA for the adjacent segment disease HIVD with Baguera C disc over the C3-C4 level achieved an excellent outcome."
