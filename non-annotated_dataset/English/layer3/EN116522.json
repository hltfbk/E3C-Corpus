  "text": "A 45-year-old patient presented with a cecal carcinoma and a large synchronous liver metastasis for major liver surgery. Liver function was determined by the LiMAx-test for the enzymatic capacity of cytochrome P450 1A2, which is ubiquitously and solely active in the liver. A solution of 2 mg/kg body weight (13)C-labeled methacetin was injected as a bolus into an intravenous catheter and, thereafter, was metabolized into acetaminophen and (13)CO2 and pulmonarily exhaled. The analysis of the (13)CO2/(12)CO2 ratio was performed using online breath sampling over a period of maximally 60 minutes. Based on this test, a value of more than 315 μg/kg/h represents normal liver function. A laparoscopic right hemihepatectomy was planned during virtual resection with a residual liver volume of 48% and a preoperative anticipated residual LiMAx of 301 μg/kg/h. After successful resection, the initial postoperative LiMAx value was 316 μg/kg/h, indicating good liver function and a correct prediction of the outcome."
