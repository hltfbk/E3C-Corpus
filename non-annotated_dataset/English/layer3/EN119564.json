  "text": "A 48-year-old male diabetic, dyslipidaemic, former heavy smoker with psychiatric illness was operated by sternotomy for a triple aorto-coronary bypass 4 years before, presented with complains of recent onset such as constant and oppressive chest pain. At surgery a mass extending from the aortic arch into the entire anterior mediastinum and to most of the right pleural cavity was found. The mass was separated from sternal periosteum and vessels of aorto-coronary by pass were isolated starting from the aortic arch up to the pericardium. The histological examination revealed aggressive fibromatosis."
