  "text": "We present the case of a 57-year-old right-handed Caucasian male in excellent health who presented to the Emergency Department with acute right-handed clumsiness. Hematologic investigations revealed a hyperviscous state and magnetic resonance imaging was consistent with cerebral emboli. Symptoms rapidly improved with phlebotomy and hydration."
