  "text": "A 16-year-old boy of Austrian origin presented with contracted valgus foot associated with tarsal hypomobility and pain. Talonavicular synostosis with ball and socket ankle joint was detected via lateral radiographs and 3 DCT scan. Preoperative laboratory investigations revealed leucocytopenia, and thrombopenia. Computerised abdominal tomography showed portal vein atresia and portopulmonary hypertension."
