  "text": "A 26-year-old female was referred to our hospital for evaluation of a pelvic mass incidentally noted in routine pre-pregnancy ultrasonography examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed an irregular mass with clear boundary in the pelvic retroperitoneum. Its signal intensity or density was inhomogeneous. On MRI images, it mainly showed isointense and slight hypointense on T1 weighted image and isointense and hyperintense on T2 weighted image. On contrast-enhanced images, it showed marked but heterogenous enhancement. With the delay time increasing, the enhanced area in the lesion increased but the CT value decreased. Dilated vessels and hemorrhage were detected in the tumor. With patience and careful separation, it was completely excised with great amount of bleeding during operation. Pathological and immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed the diagnosis of PHAT of the soft parts. We found no evidence of recurrence 18Â months after operation."
