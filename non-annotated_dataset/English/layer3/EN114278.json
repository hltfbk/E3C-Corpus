  "text": "A 48-year-old healthy gentleman sustained simultaneous bilateral thumb injuries after a fall from mountain bike which was initially missed in the emergency department. Both injuries were later treated operatively with an excellent outcome at the end of six months. A peculiar mechanism explained simultaneous injury to both the thumbs."
