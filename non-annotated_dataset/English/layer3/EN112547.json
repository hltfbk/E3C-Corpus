  "text": "A 61-year-old male patient was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and underwent PD. However, a postoperative pathologic examination diagnosed ITPN with invasive cancer. After receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, he was hospitalized for pancreatitis 16â€‰months after the operation. He was diagnosed as having recurrence near the pancreato-jejunal anastomosis based on detailed examinations and underwent a remnant total pancreatectomy. From the results of the histopathological examination, he was found to have a recurrence of ITPN as a polypoid mass without invasion distant from the surgical stump of the first operation. Furthermore, tumor cells floating in the main pancreatic duct distant from the main tumor were observed at three locations."
