  "text": "One patient presented with a month-long loss of vision in his left eye, he had surgery for esophageal cancer 2 months earlier. The patient underwent cataract surgery (by phacoemulsification) in the left eye combined with 25-gauge vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade. The microbiological culture pointed to infection with Candida albicans. At 3-month follow-up, the unaided visual acuity of left eye was 0.02 and corrected visual acuity was 0.2. In addition, there was no recurrence of the endophthalmitis within 1 year of the surgery."
