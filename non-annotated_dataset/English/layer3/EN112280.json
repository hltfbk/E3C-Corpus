  "text": "We report a case of cryptococcosis and literature review of pathogenesis and clinical aspects of cryptococcal central nervous system infection. A 64-year-old man, from Flores, complaining of severe headache since a few days before admitted to hospital. Head MRI showed multiple hypointense lesions in the left cerebellar hemisphere, suspected abscess or metastatic process. HIV testing was non-reactive. Surgery was performed, and microscopic evaluation revealed multiple abscesses containing PAS-positive budding yeasts consistent with cryptococcal abscesses."
