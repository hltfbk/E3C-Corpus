  "text": "A 10 year-old Caucasian boy presented with 3 months history of recurrent abdominal pain and a 1 month history of diarrhea. An ultrasound scan was performed on two separate occasions 10 days apart, revealing a growing cystic mass on the right side of the abdomen, in front of the psoas muscle. Subsequently an MRI scan confirmed that the mass originated from the mesenteries and infiltrates a short segment of the small bowel. Surgical resection of the affected segment was performed. Histopathological examination of the removed segment of ileum was consistent with intestinal lymphangiectasia. We could not identify any associated genetic syndromes or any other conditions that could have caused secondary intestinal lymphangiectasia. The patient's recovery from surgery was uneventful and no recurrence was observed in the following 4 years."
