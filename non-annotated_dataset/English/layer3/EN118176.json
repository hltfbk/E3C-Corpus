  "text": "We report a 55-year-old man who experienced an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction after wasp sting. The patient presented without signs of anaphylaxis or shock. The coronary angiography showed an acute stent thrombosis of the right coronary artery. Percutanous coronary intervention was performed immediately and this is an example for a cardiovascular complication associated with a hymenoptera sting, since the vasoactive, inflammatory, and thrombogenic substances of hymenoptera venoms potentially cause stent thrombosis and myocardial ischemia. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of acute stent thrombosis in a sirolimus-eluting stent following hymenoptera sting."
