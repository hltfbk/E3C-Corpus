  "text": "A 75-year-old woman was diagnosed with endometrial cancer > 2 years ago. After multiple cycles of chemotherapy, an obvious but painless umbilical mass was detected 2 wk before admission. The patient did not undergo surgical treatment but received chemotherapy, which was different from previous chemotherapy, for three consecutive cycles after discovery of umbilical metastases. Currently, the umbilical metastatic tumor has reduced, and the quality of life of the patient has significantly improved."
