  "text": "The first case, a 50-year-old Caucasian female, underwent a radical right nephrectomy for RCC. Twelve years later she underwent a radical left nephrectomy along with total hysterectomy including bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for RCC involving the right kidney and ovary. Hemodialysis was necessary because of bilateral nephrectomy. She relapsed with pulmonary metastases and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes and received cytokine based therapy along with bevacizumab. Therapy was discontinued despite the partial response because of hemorrhagic gastritis. Therapy was switched to an antiangiogenic factor but the patient manifested a parietal brain hematoma and stopped therapy. Subsequently disease relapsed with malignant pleural effusion and pulmonary nodules and a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor was administered which was withdrawn only at patient's deteriorating performance status. The patient died of the disease 13Â years after the initial diagnosis of RCC."
