  "text": "We present the case of a 75-year-old Caucasian man admitted for abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss. Two colonoscopy attempts failed in a different center and a decision to use colon capsule endoscopy was made. This exam revealed a submucosal mass located in the sigmoid colon. Surgery was performed and a local invading gastrointestinal stromal tumor was removed. This is the first image of a colonic gastrointestinal stromal tumor seen on capsule endoscopy."
