  "text": "We report the case of a 45-year-old Arab male who presented with chronic pelvic pain accompanied by straining to defecate and dysuria. The clinical examination showed a painless mass in the left perineal area. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan demonstrated a huge and well-limited pelvic mass causing displacement and compression of the rectum and bladder. Although the large size of the mass (>7Â cm in the greater diameter), it was successfully and completely excised through only perineal approach without undertaking coccygectomy or sacrectomy. The histopathological study revealed a low-grade leiomyosarcoma. The patient is currently in 4-years follow-up with no signs of recurrence or metastasis."
