  "text": "A 50-year-old man was diagnosed with myxoid liposarcoma of the right thigh and treated with wide resection. Two and a half years after the surgery, a growing low-density area was incidentally observed in the right lobe of his thyroid gland on follow-up chest computed tomography. Fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed twice, and the thyroid mass was suspected of being a sarcoma metastasis. He was treated by hemithyroidectomy, and the lesion was pathologically confirmed as a metastasis of myxoid liposarcoma."
