  "text": "Three patients presented with cases of non-infectious hypophysitis spreading outside the pituitary tissue over the cavernous sinus. All three cases were diagnosed with histological confirmation by transsphenoidal surgery, and the patients showed remarkable improvement with postoperative pulse dose steroid therapy, including disappearance of abnormal signal intensities in the bilateral hypothalami on magnetic resonance imaging, resolution of severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery, and normalization of swollen pituitary tissues. Two of 3 cases fulfilled the histological criteria of immunoglobulin G4-related disease, although none of the patients had high serum immunoglobulin G4 level."
