  "text": "A 56 year-old Caucasian woman with recurrent corneal erosions was diagnosed with corneal dystrophy of the Bowman layer after a clinical examination. Optical coherence tomography of the anterior segment (AS-OCT) mainly demonstrated deposits in the Bowman layer and a few deposits in the superficial stroma. Her son, a 36 year-old man, has a typical clinical presentation of ACD with all the deposits arranged in stromal layers. In his case, the opacities resemble snowflakes between the granular deposits, and AS-OCT shows large, snowflake-like deposits in the superficial and deep stroma without accumulation in the Bowman layer. Genetic screening in both cases shows the heterozygous R124H mutation in the TGFBI gene."
