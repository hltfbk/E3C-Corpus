  "text": "Our patient was a 41-year-old Caucasian woman with no previous history of disease who started with systemic symptoms such as headache and chills. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast of the brain suggested a mass 1.5×2cm in diameter in the temporal lobe with a non-uniform vasogenic edema. This lesion was implanted in the meninges and surgery was the first treatment. The histological findings revealed a histiocytic sarcoma. The patient received concomitant chemoradiotherapy after surgery with good tolerance and currently lives without disease."
