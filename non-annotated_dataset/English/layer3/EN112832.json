  "text": "This case report reviewed two patients with non-syndromic FD that presented with maxillary occlusal canting and facial asymmetry. Le Fort I osteotomy with recontouring of the dysplastic zygomaticomaxillary region had been performed. The stability of osseous segments were favorable. However, dysplastic, newly formed bone covered the previous plate fixation site and mild bony expansion was observed, which did not influence the facial profile. Including the current cases, 15 cases of orthognathic surgery for FD with dentition have been reported in the literature."
