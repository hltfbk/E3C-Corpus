  "text": "A 65-year-old man presented to the General Surgery Department with a complaint of repeated right upper quadrant pain for 2 years that had worsened over the previous day. The patient had a history of gallstones and hypertension. A LC was performed; it was found that a biliary stricture of 53 h duration was caused by a ligature injury of the common bile duct during the LC. Another laparoscopic exploration was performed, and the stricture was released."
