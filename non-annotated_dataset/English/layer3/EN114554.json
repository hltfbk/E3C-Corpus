  "text": "We report a case of a 42-year-old Russian man living in Estonia with rapidly progressive dementia and movement disorders manifesting as myoclonus, cerebellar ataxia and parkinsonism. The mini mental state examination score was 12/30. After excluding different neurodegenerative causes, further diagnostic testing was consistent with neurosyphilis. Treatment with penicillin was started and 6Â months later his mini mental state examination score was 25/30 and he had no myoclonus, parkinsonism or cerebellar dysfunction."
