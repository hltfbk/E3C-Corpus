  "text": "We describe the vase of a 45-year-old man with the unusual occurrence of two very rare congenital cardiac defects. He was found to have both truncus arteriosus and single ventricle with long survival. His history, clinical course, and anatomic findings are discussed along with the factors which may have contributed to his longevity, which is unique in the medical literature. His management reflected the state of medical knowledge at the time when he presented, and although alternate approaches may have been utilized if the patient presented today, this case does indicate the efficacy of the management options available at the time and place of the patient's contacts with the medical care system in Belarus. We discuss the findings, frequency, classification, and management of both of these congenital defects."
