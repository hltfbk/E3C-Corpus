  "text": "We describe the case of a 71-year-old Asian Japanese woman whose first presentation of lymphoma was congestive heart failure. Multiple imaging examinations and laboratory findings led to a presumed diagnosis of a malignant lymphoma. A tissue diagnosis of the mediastinal mass could not be performed due to our patient's generally poor condition. Our patient received corticosteroid therapy, but died 42 days after her admission. An autopsy revealed lymphoid cells encircling her ventricular wall and infiltrating her endocardium. A histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma."
