  "text": "A 14.5-year-old male patient of white Caucasian ethnicity presented with limited mouth opening, mandibular asymmetry, and dental crowding. Investigations confirmed bilateral coronoid process hyperplasia and management involved bilateral intraoral coronoidectomy surgery under general anaesthesia, followed by muscular rehabilitation. Mouth opening was restored to average maximum opening within 4Â months of surgery."
