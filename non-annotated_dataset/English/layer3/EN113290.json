  "text": "We report five cases of Para-duodenal hernia, all occurring in male patients ranging from 34 to 75Â years of age. The patients had varied manifestations presenting with abdominal pain with or without vomiting and nausea and with or without signs of intestinal obstruction. CT images showed cluster of dilated bowel segments with displaced mesenteric vessels at hernial orifice. Laparoscopic surgical approach was adopted, and the patients were discharged about a week later without further complications."
