  "text": "We retrospectively reviewed clinical presentation, investigations, treatment and outcome of six confirmed cases of severe leptospirosis admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Teaching Hospital, Anuradhapura, within a three months period from November 2014 to January 2015. All six patients were previously healthy paddy farmers presented with fever, myalgia and arthralgia. Four patients had abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting on admission. Hypotension, Neutrophilic leukocytosis and thrombocytopaenia was detected in all patients in the initial stage. Four patients had serum amylase more than 900 (range 941-2420). All patients had acute kidney injury and hepatitis. Significantly elevated amylase and low serum calcium were present in 4 cases. Five patients recovered without any evidence of residual organ damage, but one succumbed to the illness."
