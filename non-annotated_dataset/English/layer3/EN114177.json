  "text": "We present a case of a 39-year-old woman with no prior or family history of dyslipidemia, who presented with post in vitro fertilization severe hypertriglyceridemia and secondary acute pancreatitis and diabetic ketoacidosis. Discussion of the case is followed by a brief review of the literature related to in vitro fertilization-induced hypertriglyceridemia."
