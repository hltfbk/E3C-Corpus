  "text": "A 67-year-old male presented with blood-tinged stool of 1-month's duration. On colonoscopy, a solid mass was detected protruding from the colon wall. Computed tomography showed a 15 x 9.7 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass, with mottled calcification and a cystic portion, occupying the left upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity. Curative resection of the tumor was performed, and the excised tumor was composed of large multilocular cysts containing old hematomas and necrotic debris. The histology revealed an osteosarcoma showing osteoid formation and blood-filled spaces lined with atypical cells. Despite postoperative chemotherapy, he developed a recurrent peritoneal mass and multiple lung metastases 3 months postoperatively."
