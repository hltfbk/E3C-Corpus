  "text": "We report a case of 72-year-old male presenting with the right hip pain for 2 days and inability to bear weight on the right lower limb following history of domestic fall 2 days back. Radiograph of pelvis with both hips anteroposterior view and lateral view of the right hip showed right fracture neck of femur. The patient was scheduled for surgery next day but was deemed unfit on the ground of electrocardiogram reports showing ventricular arrhythmia. Cardiologist opinion was sought and coronary angiography was done. Coronary angiography revealed triple vessel lumen blockade. The patient underwent CABG 2 weeks after admission. We did cement bipolar hemiarthroplasty for the right fracture neck of femur 1 week later. The patient was mobilized on day 2 using walker. Follow-up radiograph showed acceptable prosthesis position."
