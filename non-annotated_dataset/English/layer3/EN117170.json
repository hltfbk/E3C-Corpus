  "text": "We report an incidentally-detected lipoma of the Eustachian tube in a 34-year-old Asian woman with a six-year history of persistent otitis media in her right ear. Our patient underwent surgery five years ago for the possibility of a choanal polyp, but her ear symptoms continued to be problematic following the surgery. Our patient was examined at our hospital, and computed tomography revealed a well-defined, hypodense, non-enhancing lesion involving the right Eustachian tube, measuring 1.6 Ã— 2.4 cm. The mass was excised using an endoscopic approach, and was found to originate from the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube. The tumor was sent for histopathologic evaluation. The postoperative course went smoothly, and our patient recovered during follow-up over the next five months."
