  "text": "We present a case report which describes the diagnosis and management of a 59â€‰year old female patient with chronic right temporomandibular joint pain and localized bony hard swelling over the right pre-auricular region. Patient retained normal range of motion and mouth opening. Computed tomography taken showed a radio-opaque juxta-articular ovoid mass over the right pre-auricular region in close proximity but not fused to the mandibular condyle. Surgical excision was performed for this swelling via a pre-auricular approach under general anaesthesia. Histological examination performed confirmed the diagnosis of tumoral calcinosis. Pain at the right temporomandibular joint was resolved after the surgery. Serum calcium and phosphate levels were normal in this patient."
