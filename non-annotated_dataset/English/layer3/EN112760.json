  "text": "We present an adolescent boy, with melorheostosis of the lower limb. The affected limb was longer with equally divided discrepancy of the femur and tibia. There were no another symptoms. After a thorough investigation, we performed epiphysiodesis both medial and lateral of the distal femoral and proximal tibial growth plate, using8eight plates. At the end of the growth, there was almost complete equalization of the length of his lower limbs."
