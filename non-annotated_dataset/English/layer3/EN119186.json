  "text": "A 15-year old female patient originally presenting with a well-compensated double curve pattern scoliosis. The patient was advised to undergo surgery due to the long-term negative impact of signs and symptoms of scoliosis upon her health. The patient agreed to surgery, which was performed in one of Germanys leading centres for spinal surgery. The thoracolumbar curve was corrected and fused, while the thoracic curve, clearly showing wedged vertebrae, defined as structural scoliosis, remained untreated.This operation left the patient with an unbalanced appearance, with radiological and clinical imbalance to the right. The clinical appearance of the patient though clearly deteriorated post-surgery. Furthermore, the wedged disc space below the fusion area indicates future problems with possible destabilisation accompanied probably by low back pain."
