  "text": "A 26-year old female was admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of effusive-constrictive pericarditis complicated by tamponade and cardiac arrest. An emergent pericardiocentesis was performed successfully. Hepatitis and pancreatitis were also identified in our patient. After an extensive workup, coxsackievirus B infection was suspected by positive serum complement fixation antibody titers. Our patient made a full recovery and was discharged from the hospital."
