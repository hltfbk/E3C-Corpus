  "text": "A 73 year old man with a medical history of diabetes and under oral antidiabetics, had vertigo associated with important asthenia and cutaneous mucosa pallor. He was hospitalized for an etiological investigation. He had biological tests which revealed severe anemia with 3g/dl of hemoglobin and hyperproteinemia. The blood count showed a platelet count of 180,000. Diagnosis of multiple myeloma was suspected and sternal bone marrow aspiration was indicated to confirm the diagnosis. The technique was indicated because the iliac crests were fragile and thin. The sternal bone marrow aspiration was performed after having previously eliminated the contraindication. This procedure was performed according to the usual protocol. When the needle was introduced, the doctor noticed bleeding. Immediately, he removed the needle. Few seconds later, the patient who was still lying on the table, complained of pain, developed bradycardia, hypotension and a transient loss of consciousness. He was resuscitated without success and died within 40 minutes. His death required a medico-legal investigation, for which a forensic autopsy was conducted. At the external investigation, we observed a wound surrounded by a bruising in the anterior face of the sternum in front of the third intercostal space. No traumatic lesions were noted. At the autopsy, the examination of the sternal intern table noted a wound with a bruising. In addition to this wound, there was an area of bruising over the pericardium all around a perforated wound. The pericardial sac contained approximately 300ml of blood fluid and clot. Also, there was a perforating wound in the intra pericardial portion of the ascending thoracic aorta measuring 2 mm of diameter. The rest of the autopsy was normal."
