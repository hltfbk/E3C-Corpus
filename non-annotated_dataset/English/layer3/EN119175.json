  "text": "A case of a 48-year-old man with an iatrogenic membranous tracheal wall rupture after double-lumen intubation during Ivor Lewis esophagogastrectomy is presented. Tracheal injury was successfully managed surgically with the use of bovine pericardial patch and reinforcement with the gastric conduit which was moved toward the posterior wall of the membranous trachea sealing the wall laceration."
