  "text": "A 37-year-old Caucasian woman with 5-year history of discoid lupus erythematosus presented with exophthalmos, periorbital pain and blurred vision in her right eye. Orbital computed tomography and laboratory tests were performed. Computed tomography imaging revealed an enlargement of the right medial rectus muscle. Thyroid eye disease and orbital cellulites were excluded. Corticosteroid treatment completely resolved the symptoms."
