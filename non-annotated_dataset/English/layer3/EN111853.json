  "text": "A 56-year-old man present with a 2-mo history of spreading ulcerous and necrotic papules and nodules covered with thick crusts over the face, trunk, extremities, and genitalia. The patient was diagnosed with malignant syphilis accompanied by neurosyphilis based on the characteristic morphology of the lesions, positive serological and cerebrospinal fluid tests for syphilis, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and histopathology, along with resolution of the lesions following the institution of penicillin therapy. The lesions and neurological condition successfully resolved after a course of treatment with penicillin."
