  "text": "This was a case of a 29 years old young female presenting with recurrent oral and genital ulcers. Eye lesions usually start in one eye and then pass to the other eye. They are like iridocyclitis extending very quickly to another eye. Three months later, a few shifts were introduced in the form of small initial ulcers, which for 4-5 days have been enlarged and then epithelized by leaving the catapult in the genital mucus. In the skin of the lower extremities, papules appear to be as large as corn grain."
