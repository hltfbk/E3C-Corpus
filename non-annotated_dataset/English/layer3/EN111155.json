  "text": "A 68-year-old man was diagnosed with left-sided UC 26 months prior. Although he was followed by immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine and infliximab, an emergency total proctocolectomy was performed due to rectal perforation. The resected specimen exhibited irregular wall thickening and elevated multinodular lesions extending from the mid-transverse colon to the rectum, measuring up to 52 cm in length. Histologically, the lesion was diagnosed as Oii-DLBCL and crypt abscess surrounded by mixed inflammatory cell was remained."
