  "text": "A 58-year-old myopic woman complained of decreased visual acuity and symptomatic floaters with her left eye for 3 months. We found she had significant PCO and VF in the posterior vitreous. She underwent neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum (Nd:YAG) laser vitreolysis immediately after Nd:YAG capsulotomy. After 7 days, she complained of rapid vision decline and dark shadows in her treated eye. We found she had a acute severe rhegmentogenous retinal detachment (RD) involving the macula. Then she underwent vitrectomy, retinal reattchment and silicone oil tamponade surgery immediately. Six months later, silicone oil was removed and the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of her left eye gradually improved to 10/20 and maintained during a 1-year follow-up period."
