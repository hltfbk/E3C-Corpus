  "text": "A 45-year-old female who had undergone a revision total hip arthroplasty developed concerning dermatologic, neurologic, and cardiac symptoms. Symptoms were initially attributed to an unknown autoimmune etiology. She had mildly elevated cobalt and chromium levels and subsequently underwent a second revision, this time with complete exchange of the cobalt/chromium components. By her 2-month follow-up, she reported partial resolution of symptoms. She continues to improve more than a year postoperatively."
