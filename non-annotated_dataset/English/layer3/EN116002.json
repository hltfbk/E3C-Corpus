  "text": "A 60-year-old Japanese man with a 20-year history of rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to our hospital with a left inguinal tumor. Open biopsy was performed and a biopsy specimen revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. As our patient had received methotrexate for 4Â years, we diagnosed the lymphoproliferative disease as being methotrexate-related. This lymphoma was not associated with Epstein- Barr virus by Epstein-Barr virus-encoded ribonucleic acid in-situ hybridization, but this patient was an Epstein-Barr virus carrier, regarding serological testing. The lymphoma went into complete remission after 6 courses of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone/prednisolone therapy. Two years later, however, rheumatoid arthritis activity gradually increased and was not controlled with salazosulfapyridine. Etanercept was administered in view of its possible effect on B-cells, and this reduced the level of disease activity without recurrence of lymphoma."
