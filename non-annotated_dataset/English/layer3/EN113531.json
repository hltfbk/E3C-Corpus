  "text": "A 67-year-old man presented with cough and dyspnea for 10 days. Workup revealed bilateral pulmonary effusion. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a large mass in the left atrium. Urgent surgical resection under cardiopulmonary bypass was performed. We focused on oxygenation improvement and cardiac function management by applying protective ventilation with low positive end expiratory pressure, low dose inotropic agents, and other methods to maintain stable homeostasis. Results of biopsy established a diagnosis of metastatic leiomyosarcoma."
