  "text": "A 29-year-old man presented with an acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding from a submucosal tumor located in the proximal part III of the duodenum, 3 cm distal of the papilla of Vater. After an emergency laparotomy with ligation of tumor-feeding vessels in a primary hospital, definitive surgical therapy was performed by partial resection of the duodenum with a duodenojejunostomy. Histology revealed a GIST with a diameter of 2.5 cm and <5 mitoses/50 high power fields, indicating a low risk of malignancy. Therefore no adjuvant therapy with Imatinib was initiated."
