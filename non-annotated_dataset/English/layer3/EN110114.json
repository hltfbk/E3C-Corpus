  "text": "A 16-year-old man presented with a one month history of fever, pubic pain which irradiates to the genitals and increases when hip is mobilized, and this fact produces gait claudicating. The symptoms started a few days after playing a football match, though the patient denied any history of trauma. He had a temperature of 38.5ÂºC and a normal testicular and abdominal examination. The C reactive protein had risen to 12 mg/l with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 25 mm/h and a white blood cell of 16410 per mm3. Echocardiogram was normal and autoimmune screen was negative. The blood culture was negative. The magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) of the pelvis showed a bone oedema of symphysis pubis and abdominal muscles. The puncture guided by computed tomography (CT) of the articulation of pubis returned of Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible (SAMS). The patient was prescribed intravenous flucloxacillin 1 g six times a day for six weeks and discharged with further four months of oral flucloxacillin at 1g three times a day on microbiologist's advice. A repeat MRI after four months showed a complete resolution."
