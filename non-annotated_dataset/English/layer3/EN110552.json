  "text": "A 62-year-old man, with chronic smoking, arrived at the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain with sudden-onset. On arrival, there was a collapse, blood pressure 90/60mmHg and pulse 109/min, the patient was pale, apyretic and had an abdominal defense. The hemoglobin was at 8 g/dl and WBC at 19000/mmÂ³. After resuscitation measures and transfusion of 4 units of red blood cells transfusions, the ultrasound examination showed echogenic peritoneal effusion with hypoechognic mass of the left hypochondrium. As the patient remained haemodynamically unstable, he underwent an exploratory laparotomy. During laparotomy, there was a hemoperitoneum related to complete decapsulation of spleen. The decision was made to proceed to a splenectomy. Histological examination confirmed the non-pathological aspect of a decapsulated spleen. The patient's hospital course was unremarkable. The patient received pneumococcal, meningococcal and haemophilus vaccinations and was discharged on life-long penicillin prophylaxis."
