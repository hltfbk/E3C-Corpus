  "text": "A 67 years old female, who presented with history of per rectal bleeding, was diagnosed with submucosal GIST of 4.5 cm in diameter at right posterior wall of 7 cm from anal verge. Histology of biopsy showed abundant spindle-shaped cells arranged in bundles that were positive for CD34 and negative for C-Kit, desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), and S-100. The tumor was excised by TAMIS successfully. Final histopathology showed pT2 tumor with C-Kit positive and mitosis count 10 per 50 HPF. Postoperative period was uneventful, and she was discharged on adjuvant imatinib mesylate for 3 years."
