  "text": "A 68-year-old woman diagnosed with an epidermoid anal cancer (stage 3B) was initially treated with chemoradiation therapy (Standard Nigro Protocol) in 2014. At the 5-year mark post-treatment, she was diagnosed with a recurrent anal epidermoid cancer in the form of isolated peritoneal carcinomatosis proven by biopsy. After declining systemic chemotherapy, she underwent cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy with Mitomycin-C©. Peritoneal carcinomatosis index was evaluated at 10, and intraoperative frozen sections were positive for carcinoma of epidermoid origin compatible with anal cancer. A completeness of cytoreduction score of 0 was achieved during the cytoreductive surgery, and her hospital course was unremarkable. She remains disease-free 12 months later."
