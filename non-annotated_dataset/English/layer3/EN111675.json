  "text": "This study reported one male patient on peritoneal dialysis who suffered from severe mental disorders after receiving an overdose of acyclovir and valacyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster. The literature review suggested that hemodialysis is better than peritoneal dialysis to clear acyclovir from the circulation. The patient died after his consciousness deteriorated despite peritoneal dialysis and continuous blood purification."
