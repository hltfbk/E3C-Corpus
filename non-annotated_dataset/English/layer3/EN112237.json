  "text": "The patient was born at 39 weeks (body mass = 2550 g). He was diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, non-confluent PA, and bilateral patent ductus arteriosus. Right and left Blalock-Taussig shunts with patent ductus arteriosus ligations were placed on day 27 and 3 months, respectively. At 19 months (8.8 kg), definitive repair was performed with tricuspid valved conduit concurrent with PA reconstruction using an autologous pericardium roll conduit. The autologous pericardium was treated with glutaraldehyde (autologous pericardium fixed with 0.4% glutaraldehyde for 7 min and rolled as conduit - 12 mm in diameter and 30 mm in length). Following an incision on the visceral side of the PAs before the 1st branch, the autologous pericardial roll conduit was anastomosed. Follow-up angiographies on postoperative months 9 and 57 demonstrated that the PA, including the autologous pericardium roll conduit, had spontaneously enlarged."
