  "text": "A 63-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with back pain persisting for 4â€‰months and a 2-day history of fever and right chest pain. The patient was initially treated as right-sided empyema due to general bacteria. However, after removal of the chest tube, a previously overlooked paravertebral lesion was observed on CT. MRI confirmed VO at T7/8. Mycobacterium abscessus ssp. abscessus was detected in both the thoracic cavity and the paravertebral lesion. Both VO and the paravertebral abscess were improved by antimycobacterial treatment."
