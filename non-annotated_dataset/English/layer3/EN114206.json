  "text": "This case describes a 61-year old woman who developed acute hyponatremic encephalopathy when preparing for elective outpatient lower endoscopy. She had had negligible oral solute intake for two days and ingested four liters of clear fluid within two hours. On admission, the patient was agitated and had slurred speech. Treatment with hypertonic saline lead to full recovery. A brisk aquaresis confirmed acute dilutional hyponatremia."
