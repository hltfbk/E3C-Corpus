  "text": "A 76-year-old male had a history of surgical replacement of the whole aortic arch due to a TAA. Three years after the surgery, severe hemoptysis occurred, which resulted in the patient's emergency hospitalization at our hospital. The patient was diagnosed with ruptured pseudoaneurysms of the aortic arch. Emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was performed. .After that, the hemoptysis stopped, and the patient was discharged. Two months later, the hemoptysis reccurred so the patient was re-admitted to our hospital. CT showed a type 2 endoleak from the bronchial artery. The anastomotic pseudoaneurysms remained. As re-rupturing of the anastomotic aneurysms due to a type 2 endoleak was suspected, transcatheter arterial embolization was performed to treat the type 2 endoleak. The patient's hemoptysis stopped, and he was discharged.One year later, CT showed that the anastomotic pseudoaneurysms had disappeared, and the diameter of the aorta had also reduced."
