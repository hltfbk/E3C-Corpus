  "text": "We present a case of a man with Crohn's disease actively requiring immunosuppressive therapy who subsequently received pembrolizumab for metastatic melanoma. He had no further progression of metastatic disease and had resolution of his pulmonary nodule while he experienced no Crohn's disease flares or immune related adverse events. We surveyed the existing literature for studies examining the use of ICPIs in patients with autoimmune disorders and reviewed the unique mechanism of action of the α4β7 inhibitor, vedolizumab."
