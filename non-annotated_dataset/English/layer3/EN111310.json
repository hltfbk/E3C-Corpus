  "text": "The patient was a 48-year-old man with a 1-year history of pancreatic and liver masses and refractory hypoglycemia. Increased uptake of the tracer fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was found in the liver and bones by fluorine-18 FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography. After multidisciplinary discussion, a distal pancreatectomy procedure was performed, and histological examination showed a lesion composed of abundant heterogeneous spindle cells with localized necrosis. On immunohistochemistry evaluation, STAT6 was found to be diffusely expressed in the tumor. Based on the overall evidence, the patient was diagnosed with malignant pancreatic SFT with liver and bone metastases."
