  "text": "We present a case of a 46-year-old male patient with bilateral blepharoedema, corneal opacity in the left eye and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The patient was subjected to total maxillectomy, exenteration of the left orbit and treatment with liposomal amphotericin B. Direct mycological analysis with KOH 10% revealed hyaline, coenocytic, long and wide hyphae. Apophysomyces ossiformis was identified from maxillary biopsy using 18S-ITS1-5.8S-ITS2-28S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. The patient requested to be transferred to another hospital to continue treatment, where he died on the ninth day after admittance."
