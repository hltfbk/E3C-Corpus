  "text": "We report the case of 56-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with a tender right groin lump. She had undergone a right-sided inguinal hernia repair 3 years earlier. Tubal occlusion had been performed using Filshie clips 21 years prior. Computed tomography revealed a tubal clip within her right inguinal region, and had also been identified on imaging prior to a previous hernia repair. Our patient underwent repair of a right femoral hernia, with the tubal clip identified in the sac and removed. She has since had no recurrences."
