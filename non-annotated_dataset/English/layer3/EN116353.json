  "text": "A 74-year-old female suffered from long-standing episodes of itch of the dermatomes C2 to C6 on the right side that was refractory to any treatment. On occurrence it propagated in a proximal to distal fashion. Between the episodes the patient was asymptomatic. MRI of the cervical spine uncovered a spinal glioma that matched the location of the symptoms. Treatment with gabapentin led to a prompt reduction of the symptoms."
