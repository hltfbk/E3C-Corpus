  "text": "We report a 76-year-old female patient diagnosed with anorectal malignant melanoma by colonoscopy and biopsy. Intraoperative examination revealed two distinct anorectal tumors, one melanotic and another amelanotic, as well as two pigmented mucosal zones at the dentate line level. Abdominal perineal resection was performed. A pathological report confirmed all four lesions to be melanomas. Postoperatively, we followed an immunotherapy protocol targeting PD-1 (nivolumab). The patient had 24 mo of disease-free follow-up upon completion of nivolumab treatment."
