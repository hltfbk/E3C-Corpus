  "text": "We describe a 67-year-old man with metastatic conventional chondrosarcoma who was treated with nivolumab. Treatment was discontinued after restaging showed increased tumor burden, which later proved to be pseudoprogression. The patient restarted nivolumab and continues to have a near complete response."
