  "text": "A 46-year-old man who was diagnosed with IgA vasculitis (IgAV) at the age of 38 was treated with prednisolone and mizoribine. However, complications such as common carotid arteritis or recurrent oral ulcer suggested the possibility of another pathophysiology. Later, increasing urine protein developed, suggesting disease aggravation. However, renal biopsy showed arteriosclerotic changes caused mainly by hypertension, negating exacerbation. After renal biopsy, his renal dysfunction and body temperature fluctuated, and detailed examinations revealed recurrent oral and genital ulcers and a folliculitis-like rash on his scrotum. Later, he complained of myodesopsia caused by hemorrhage in the ocular fundus due to occlusive vasculitis. Complete BD was diagnosed after development of the symptoms, and he was treated with prednisolone and colchicine."
