  "text": "A 70-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease s/p drug-eluting stent placement on Plavix, coronary artery bypass grafting, mechanical aortic valve replacement on warfarin, and iron deficiency anemia on replacement was admitted for the evaluation of fatigue and melena for a month. Physical examination was positive for black stool. The only significant lab was a drop in hemoglobin/hematocrit (Hg/dl/H%) of 10/32 to 4/12.5. Fibrosure was sought which suggested that the patient had an F4 cirrhosis. Endoscopy showed nodules in the gastric antrum which were presumptively treated as GAVE with argon plasma coagulation (APC). Surgical pathology showed reactive gastropathy and gastric polyps. Review of the past histology suggested that because of the overlap in the histopathological features of hyperplastic polyps and GAVE, they were misinterpreted as hyperplastic polyp rather than nodular GAVE."
