  "text": "We herein report two patients who suffered from PICA-D complicated with ischemic stroke. Initial magnetic resonance arteriography was not informative, however, T1-VISTA depicted high-intensity signal areas suggesting an intramural hematoma of PICA-D in both cases. The high-intensity signal areas gradually reduced and finally disappeared at 4 months and 5 months after the onset, respectively."
