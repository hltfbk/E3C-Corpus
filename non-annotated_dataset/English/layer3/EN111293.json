  "text": "A 27-year-old woman at 31 + 5 weeks' gestation presented to the emergency department with a three-day history of the left lower abdominal pain. US discovered a mass of 87 × 61 mm in the left abdomen, but did not show whether the mass originated from the left ovary or the uterus. MRI showed the left ovary was increased in size to 82 × 42 × 85 mm with peripheral follicles. On fat-suppressed T2-weighted images, the signal intensity of the lesion was significantly decreased compared with the right ovary. The adjacent fallopian tube was found to be thickened. The radiologists diagnosed ovary infarction secondary to adnexal torsion. With the provisional diagnosis of adnexal torsion, the patient was taken to surgery. The left adnexal torsion was found during surgery. There was extensive hemorrhage and necrosis, so a left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed. The histopathology confirmed an extensively hemorrhagic fallopian tube and ovary with partial necrosis."
