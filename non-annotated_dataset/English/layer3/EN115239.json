  "text": "A weak and elderly patient has cardiac arrest, and a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) clause is written in the patient's medical record. Paramedics at the scene cannot see that the patient's general appearance match conditions which would indicate the DNR clause, so they start cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and the patient survives. This turns out to be a crucial decision. The DNR clause is from an earlier bout with serious disease from which the patient has recovered, against all odds, and someone has forgotten to remove the clause from the medical record."
