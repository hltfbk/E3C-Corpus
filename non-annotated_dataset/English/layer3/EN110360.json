  "text": "Patient JD, 16 years old, without significant pathological antecedents, consults for a significant deformation of the nasal pyramid on the right side. The beginning of the symptomatology goes back to 4 years by the progressive installation of a right nasal obstruction associated with an anterior and posterior fetid chronic rhinorrhea unimpeded by well-conducted antibiotic treatment with occurrence of a progressive deformation of the ipsilateral nasal pyramid.\nThe endonasal examination after aspiration of the purulent secretions showed an irregular granulomatous tissue mass at the level of the right nostril vestibule not allowing the introduction of the rigid optics due to its large volume and which is hard on palpatation with the stylet.\nThe nasosinusal tomodensitometry examination showed 3 cm long axis calcium density opacity, with a hypodensity at its center, with destruction of medial wall of maxillary sinus which led us to make the diagnosis of rhinolithiasis.\nThe extraction was carried out under general anesthesia under control of a rigid endoscope 0Â°, a hook having allowed the rhinolite to be brought from back to front and a lower turbinectomy was performed due to its incarceration at the level of the inferior turbinate. Endoscopic verification showed complete emptiness of the right nasal fossa. The evolution was favorable after 6 months of decline."
