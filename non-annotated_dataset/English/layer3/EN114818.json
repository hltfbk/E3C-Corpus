  "text": "The authors report a case of a 31-year-old woman with progressive loss of subcutaneous fat, limited to the face, neck and thorax. She presented no severe metabolic complications, neither signs of insulin resistance. Laboratory tests revealed mild dyslipidemia, and low serum levels of complement-component 3. Clinical and biochemical characteristics were consistent with the diagnosis of Barraquer-Simons syndrome."
