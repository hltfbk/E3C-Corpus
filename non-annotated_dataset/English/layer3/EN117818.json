  "text": "A 59-year-old woman underwent a modified radical mastectomy for infiltrating ductal cancer of the breast six years ago and a total abdominal hysterectomy for leiomyosarcoma of the uterus two years ago. About 2400 cGy total dose radiotherapy has also been applied after total hysterectomy for bone metastasis of breast cancer. She admitted to our clinic with the complaints of acute abdomen due to perforated small bowel metastasis of leiomyosarcoma during the radiotherapy. Laparotomy was performed and leiomyosarcoma of the ileum was removed totally. Histopathologic examination of the specimen confirmed the presence of the leiomyosarcoma in intestinal tissue samples."
