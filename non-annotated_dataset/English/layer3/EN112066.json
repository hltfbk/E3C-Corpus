  "text": "A 28-year-old man presented at our hospital after a fall from his bicycle. The patient had a history of acromioclavicular joint reconstruction with a suture-button and a hook plate for right acromioclavicular joint dislocation, seven months ago at another hospital. The hook plate had been removed four months ago, while X-ray radiography before removal had shown the widening of a suture hole. In the current fall from the bicycle, X-ray radiography revealed a clavicle fracture through the previous drill hole for suture-button. We removed the suture-button and performed an open reduction and internal fixation for the clavicle fracture."
