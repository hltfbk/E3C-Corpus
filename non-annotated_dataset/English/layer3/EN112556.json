  "text": "A 25-year-old woman presented with symptoms of chronic exertional dyspnea and productive cough. Imaging studies showed complete left lung atelectasis due to a mass occluding the left main bronchus, as well as extreme mediastinal deviation and substantial herniation of the right lung into the left hemithorax. Bronchoscopic biopsy of the tumor and subsequent left pneumonectomy with concurrent lymph node dissection revealed an atypical carcinoid. Sixteen months after surgery the patient has been asymptomatic with repeat imaging studies showing no change in mediastinal shifting."
