  "text": "We present a 67-year-old woman without heterotaxy syndrome associated with interruption of the left IVC that continued with the hemiazygos vein system, a PLSVC, and an anomalous LHV draining the into coronary sinus (CS). The venous anomalies caused a CS aneurysm. The anomalies were demonstrated by echocardiography and the diagnosis was established by contrast-enhanced computed tomography. Three days later, a coronary artery bypass graft was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis. Half a month after surgery, the pain had been relieved and the patient was discharged from the hospital."
