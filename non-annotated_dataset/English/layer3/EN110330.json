  "text": "An 18 year old black male, with no previous medical history, presented to the casualty department at the RK Khan Hospital in Durban, South Africa with atypical chest pain. The chest pain was present for a duration of 1 month and occurred in the early hours of the morning, lasting for approximately 3 minutes. There were no associated palpitations, autonomic symptoms, pre-syncope or syncope and the pain was not related to respiration or food intake. On further enquiry, the patient volunteered that his \"different appearance\" prompted him to search the internet to determine if other people had features similar to him. The internet search suggested that he may have MFS, and this was the primary reason for him to visit the hospital to find out if he indeed did have MFS. The patient did not have a family history of a similar problem.\nOn general examination the patient was comfortable at rest, extremely tall (2.1 meters) and thin with typical musculoskeletal features of MFS. These included arachnodactyly with positive wrist and thumb signs, pectus carinatum deformity, hind foot valgus, dolichostenomelia (< 0.78), increased arm span/height, scoliosis, dolichochepaly, enophthalmos, downslanting palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, and retrognathia. His total systemic score was 10 based on the revised Ghent nosology. Figure 1 demonstrates the patients typical clinical signs of MFS.\nThe patient was normotensive with a sinus bradycardia of 60 beats per minute. The first heart sound was soft with a murmur of mitral regurgitation graded as 4/5.\nThere were no clinical features of infective endocarditis or cardiac failure. Respiratory examination demonstrated pectus carinatum and was otherwise normal.\nOphthalmology examination conducted by an ophthalmologist revealed a left dense cataract with lens subluxation but no dislocation, iridodonesis, an old retinal detachment and minimal light perception. The right eye had a clear lens with no subluxation or dislocation, but showed iridodonesis with myopia.\nLaboratory tests were within normal limits (full blood count, urea and electrolytes, calcium, magnesium and phosphate, liver function tests, growth hormone, prolactin, troponin T, creatine kinase).\nChest X-ray showed an increased cardiothoracic ratio of greater the 50%. Echocardiography demonstrated prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet with moderately severe mitral regurgitation and aortic root dilatation measuring 5 cm. The ejection fraction was 65% and no evidence of aortic dissection was noted.\nComputerised tomography (CT) showed dilatation of the aortic sinuses of valsava extending to the ascending aorta. The aortic root was dilated measuring 6.3 X 6.4cm. The ascending aorta measured 3.1cm. There was no dissection or calcification of the aortic wall. The arch of the aorta and its main branches were within normal limits. The root of the main pulmonary artery was dilated measuring 4.1cm. The rest of the pulmonary arterial system was within normal limits. A suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm was noted with length 15.1 cm and diameter of 5 cm. There were no features of dissection, mural thrombi, or signs of imminent rupture.\nThe right kidney had dual blood supply, with one artery arising from the inferior portion of the aneurysm and the other from the normal aorta inferiorly. The single left renal artery arose from the inferior aspect of the aneurysm. All renal arteries were patent and there was appropriate and symmetrical enhancement of the kidneys.\nThe coeliac axis and the superior mesenteric arteries arose from the abdominal aortic aneurysm. The inferior mesenteric artery arose from the normal abdominal aorta.\nThe lung fields were clear and the cranio-cervical junction was normal with no subluxation.\nThere was pectus carinatum and a left scoliosis of the upper thoracic spine. Dural ectasia with posterior scalloping of the vertebral bodies was noted in the lumbar sacral spine. There was expansion of the sacral spinal canal and enlargement of the sacral foramen.\nThe patient was counseled on his medical condition and offered surgery for his mitral valve and aortic root dilation. After consultation with his family he declined surgical intervention. He was discharged on losartan and subsequently lost to follow. Prior to discharge informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case."
