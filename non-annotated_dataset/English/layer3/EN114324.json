  "text": "A 61-year-old female with history of gastric cancer at age 36 presented with a transmurally invasive tumor of the right hemicolon and liver metastasis. A right hemicolectomy was performed. Histopathological analysis showed a mixed trophoblastic and syncytiotrophoblastic differentiation, consistent with choriocarcinoma. Disease progression was rapid under oxaliplatin, capecitabine, irinotecan, and bevacizumab. Molecular phenotyping identified loss of mismatch-repair protein immunostaining for PMS2, microsatellite instability, a lack of MLH1 promoter methylation, and lack of BRAF mutation suggestive of Lynch syndrome. Targeted next-generation sequencing revealed an ataxia telangiectasia mutated (p.P604S) missense mutation. A bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin treatment protocol targeting germ cell neoplasia lead to disease remission and prolonged survival of 34â€‰months."
