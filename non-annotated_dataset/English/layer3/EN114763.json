  "text": "A 68-year-old man with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia was treated with imatinib. He was diagnosed with ascending colon cancer and underwent curative surgery. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was healthy at 6 months after surgery, allowing for reinitiation of imatinib therapy. After the reinitiation of therapy, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mass shadow in the right iliopsoas muscle. This lesion was clinically diagnosed as recurrent colon cancer with an abscess, which was resected surgically. A pathological examination uncovered both edema and inflammation. Two months after the second surgery, imatinib therapy was reinitiated; however, he again developed painful swelling and erythema in his right thigh. A CT scan revealed a similar shadow as described previously. He was then diagnosed with pyomyositis; he underwent incisional drainage and was administered linezolid. Following the treatment for pyomyositis, there was no cancer recurrence or evidence of any recurrent pyomyositis."
