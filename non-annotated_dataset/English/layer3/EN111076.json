  "text": "We report a 75-year-old female whose right superior pulmonary vein V1 existed dorsal to the right main pulmonary artery and V2+3 existed dorsal to V4+5. Thus, we could not find V1 and V2+3 in the hilum just after a thoracotomy to perform right upper lobectomy for lung cancer. Thus, the right main pulmonary artery and the superior trunk (A1+3) were exposed without cutting the superior pulmonary vein."
