  "text": "We present a case of a 24-year-old male, who came with a swelling in the right side inguinal region for 2 years which was diagnosed to be osteochondroma by trocar biopsy. The site and presentation are rare. The patient had no visceral or vascular involvement though the lesion was very near many vital structures on superior pubic ramus."
