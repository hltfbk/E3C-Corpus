  "text": "A 55-year-old man with acute lower-limb ischemia was referred to our hospital after endovascular intervention failed and underwent above-the-knee amputation for severe limb necrosis. On postoperative day 8, he developed small bowel necrosis and underwent resection. Histopathological examination of the resected bowel revealed that the submucosal arterial emboli were positive for the markers of squamous cells. He had unresectable lung squamous cell carcinoma with left atrium invasion. The subsequent embolisms were thought to be caused by the advanced lung cancer."
