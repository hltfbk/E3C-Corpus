  "text": "A 97-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the emergency department of our institution with a painful, malodorous, necrotic right upper neck mass, which had progressed over a two-month period. Investigations confirmed stage 1A diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Palliative radiotherapy was delivered to a dose of 25 Gray (Gy) in five fractions on alternate days over two consecutive weeks. After four months, the mass completely resolved with no residual symptoms."
