  "text": "We herein describe an unusual case of young acute ischemic stroke patient, presenting with acute right peripheral facial palsy, right abducens palsy, and contralateral hemihypesthesia, manifesting as MGS. After receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, as well as rosuvastatin, the patient recovered significantly. The high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated a diagnosis of VAD."
