  "text": "A 61-year-old female presented with a palpable painless mass in the right breast. Mammography revealed a large irregular dense shadow without obvious internal calcification. A simple lumpectomy was performed, and a 1.6cm well-circumscribed pale-tan nodule was presented. Histologically, the nodule was composed of two obscure lobules. One exhibited typical histological image of adenoid cystic carcinoma, the other one showed the image of epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma of salivary gland, and support the diagnosis of biphasic malignant adenomyoepithelioma. Transition between the two lobules was gradual. Immunohistochemically, CK18 and P63 highlighted the epithelial and myoepithelial cells respectively in both lesions. CD117 was positive in the epithelial cells of adenoid cystic carcinoma, but was totally negative in malignant adenomyoepithelioma."
