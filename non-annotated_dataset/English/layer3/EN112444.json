  "text": "A 3-year-old Hispanic male was first seen in the emergency department for elbow pain following a fall from a sofa. He was incorrectly diagnosed with an isolated intra-articular ulna fracture. 5 weeks after the initially missed Monteggia fracture-dislocation, he presented to clinic with 90° flexion, 40° extension, and a 20° pronation/supination arc. An opening-wedge osteotomy was performed at the intra-articular CORA to restore ulnar length and allow for reduction of the radial head. The magnitude of the ulnar opening-wedge osteotomy was trialed until the radiocapitellar joint maintained reduction throughout pronosupination."
