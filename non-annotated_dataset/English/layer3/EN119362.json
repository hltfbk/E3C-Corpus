  "text": "A 69-year old man presented with a large, irreducible left inguinoscrotal hernia and symptoms of obstruction. On examination, there was an 8 cm palpable mass within the hernia sac. CT scan revealed small and proximal large bowel obstruction secondary to a large ingunoscrotal sac and synchronous colonic tumours of the transverse colon and the ascending colon. The former presented as an inguinoscrotal mass. Laparotomy revealed a large tumour mass arising from the transverse colon in the hernia sac. The procedure was followed by an extended right hemicolectomy, during which the second tumour in the ascending colon was also resected."
