  "text": "We report a case of a loosened Kirschner wire migrating from the right acromioclavicular joint to the left side of the neck in a 34-year-old Taiwanese man following a route of transversal, descendant, and then ascendant directions. The Kirschner wire was removed by exploratory neck dissection under C-arm fluoroscopy assistance without complication."
