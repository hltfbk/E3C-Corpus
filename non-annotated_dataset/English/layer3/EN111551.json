  "text": "A 2-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital with left cryptorchidism and ipsilateral CSA. An innovative method was used in the patient where a scrotal skin pedicle from the right part of scrotal skin was transplanted to the left side. At the same time, descent orchiopexy was performed. At the 4-mo follow-up, the left testicle was located in the scrotum and the size and shape were normal."
