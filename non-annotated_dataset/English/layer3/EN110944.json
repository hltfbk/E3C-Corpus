  "text": "A 26â€‰weeks pregnant, gravida two, para one, 35-year-old patient with prosthetic aortic and mitral valves presented to an external emergency clinic with clouding of consciousness. Her international normalised ratio(INR) was 8.9 at presentation. Brain MRI revealed a left subdural haematoma with no significant mass effect. Warfarin treatment was discontinued. On the second day of follow-up, she was referred to our centre for further evaluation of her clinical deterioration. She was haemodynamically stable on admission to the intensive care unit and followed up with a stable condition until the fourth day when she developed right eye drop and subsequent loss of consciousness. Her haematoma was surgically evacuated, and her condition improved. Eventually, she and a healthy newborn were discharged."
