  "text": "The first occurred in a 64-year-old woman presented with back pain and the second, a multifocal lesion, in a 47-year-old man with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Histology disclosed a vascular tumor with striking anastomosing pattern, minimal nuclear atypia and locally infiltrative pattern, mimicking superficially angiosarcoma. Extramedullary hematopoiesis, extensive perirenal fat entrapment and increased number of mast cells were additional features in the second lesion. Both patients are well, without disease, 25 and 14Â months after diagnosis."
