  "text": "We describe a 29-year-old man suffering from fever with maxillary sinusitis, multiple lung nodules, and proteinuria. He was diagnosed with Fabry's disease accompanying granulomatosis with polyangiitis on the basis of the low activity of peripheral leukocyte Î±-galactosidase A and pathological findings in the lung and kidney. Glucocorticoid and cyclophosphamide were administered, followed by enzyme replacement therapy. Progression to end-stage renal disease has not been observed for 6 years until the time of drafting this manuscript."
