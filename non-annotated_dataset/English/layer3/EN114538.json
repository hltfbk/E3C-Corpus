  "text": "We describe a case of progressive follicular dendritic cell sarcoma of the lung and pleura, treated based on knowledge of the tumour's molecular aberrations. The patient was initially treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy and developed disease progression. Mutation testing by Caris molecular intelligence demonstrated a breast cancer 2 gene mutation and further treatment with carboplatin and veliparib achieved disease stabilisation."
