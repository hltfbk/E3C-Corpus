  "text": "Here we present one male patient with anicteric leptospirosis that manifested as neuroleptospirosis with aseptic meningitis, although he did not have impaired kidney function or thrombocytopenia. He recovered well after an early investigation and treatment for leptospirosis based on suspected relevant risk factors and clinical manifestations."
