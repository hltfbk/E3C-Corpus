  "text": "Massive neutrophil leukocytosis of approximately 100,000/μl was diagnosed in a 57-year-old Caucasian woman with metastatic undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma. A bone marrow trephine biopsy revealed massively increased granulopoiesis, but no evidence of monoclonal myeloproliferative disease. After the primary tumor had been resected, white blood count (WBC) plummeted and went back to nearly normal levels within one week. With progressive metastatic disease, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) plasma levels were found to be increased by 10-fold. White blood count (WBC) strictly correlated with tumor burden and response to chemotherapy. In the final stage of treatment resistent disease, white blood count (WBC) approximated 300,000/μl."
