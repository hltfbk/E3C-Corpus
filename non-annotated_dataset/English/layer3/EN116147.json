  "text": "A 47-year-old Caucasian man developed progressive bilateral hand tremor, difficulty walking, cognitive slowing and headache. A physical examination showed bilateral hand tremor with dysmetria, hyperreflexia and abnormal gait. Magnetic resonance imaging of his brain showed bilateral, symmetrical, increased intensity on T2-weighted images concurrent with linear contrast enhancement in a radial distribution throughout his white matter, sparing subcortical regions in his centrum semiovale, corona radiata, basal ganglia and brainstem. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated elevated choline and decreased N-acetyl aspartate. Except for elevated protein and lymphocytic pleocytosis, examination of his cerebrospinal fluid showed no abnormalities. Serological tests for rheumatologic, vasculitic, paraneoplastic, infectious and peroxisomal disorders were negative. A brain biopsy revealed primary angiitis of the central nervous system. Our patient was treated with steroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide, with improvement in signs and symptoms as well as changes on magnetic resonance imaging."
