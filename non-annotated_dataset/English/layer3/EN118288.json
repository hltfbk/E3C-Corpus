  "text": "We report the case of a 40-year-old Somali man who presented with severe facial disfigurement, including total absence of both upper and lower lips. After a failed initial reconstruction, a combination of platysma flaps and a left deltopectoral flap provided mucosal lining, while a scalp visor flap served to recreate upper and lower lips, the beard and moustache."
