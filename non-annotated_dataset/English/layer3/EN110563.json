  "text": "A 58-year-old postmenopausal woman presented to our Emergency Department with complaints of massive abdominal distention which started gradually 8 months ago. The patient also complained of difficulty in breathing and ambulation. There were no other gastrointestinal, urinary, or gynecological symptoms. The woman had a significant past medical history of hyper-tension and her past surgical history included one cesarean section 10 years ago. Her family history is negative for malignant ovarian and breast cancer in first-degree relatives. On physical examination, the patient's abdomen was grossly distended, hard and tense on palpation. Blood analysis revealed hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL, 6330 leukocytes and 351000 platelets. All tumor markers were within normal limits. However CA 19-9 level was more than 953 U/mL (normal range: 0-37 U/mL). An abdominal and pelvis scan (CT) with contrast was done, which revealed a huge pelvi-abdominal mass measuring more than 45Ã—35cm. The patient was operated for exploratory laparotomy with removal of right ovarian mass with total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with complete omentectomy and appendectomy. All other abdominal and pelvic organs were normal and para-aortic lymph nodes were not palpable. The 44cm x 39cm x 19 cm lobulated tumour weighing 15.4 kg had a thick wall with solid and cystic areas filled with mucinous fluid. Her final histopathology report was suggestive of borderline mucinous tumor of right ovary and cystadenoma of left ovary. The FIGO stage was pT1c2. The patient had no intra-operative or postoperative complications. On day 6 of surgery, patient was discharged and referred to oncology department for further management. She received adjuvant chemotherapy and was discharged home in healthy condition. Four months following the surgery, the CA 19-9 levels had regressed to normal range. The patient has been symptom-free thereafter and the CA 19-9 levels have also remained normal until date, i.e. ten months past the surgery."
