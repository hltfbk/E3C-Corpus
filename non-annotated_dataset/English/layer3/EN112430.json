  "text": "A 33-year-old Chinese woman with abdominal pain was diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy implanted in the liver according to CT and advised to transfer the patient to tertiary referral center. The patient had a significant increasing abdominal pain and intense reflex sensitivity in the right shoulder when she presented to our hospital. Laparoscopic surgery was decided immediately with the impression of ruptured abdominal pregnancy and hemorrhagic shock. It was found that ectopic pregnancy was implanted on the diaphragmatic surface.The pregnant tissue was completely resected from the diaphragm and bipolar electrocoagulation was used to control bleeding. The patient was stable and discharged 3â€‰days after surgery in a good condition."
