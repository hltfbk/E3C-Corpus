  "text": "A 57-year-old Japanese man with essential hypertension was treated with candesartan. Candesartan was switched to nifedipine for the initial 10 days of an observation period and 5 days later he was started on ipragliflozin (day 6 of nifedipine treatment) with nifedipine for the next 5 days. Thereafter (from day 11 to day 20), candesartan was started instead of nifedipine and ipragliflozin was continued. In the last 5 days ipragliflozin was stopped and he was treated with candesartan alone. Neither nifedipine alone (0.038+/-0.004) nor candesartan alone (0.048+/-0.006) produce any trace amount of glycosuria. However, the extent of glycosuria under ipragliflozin with candesartan treatment (37.5+/-8.45) was significantly greater than that of ipragliflozin with nifedipine (23.75+/-0.35; P<0.05)."
