  "text": "The aim of this paper is to report a case-series of representative clinical situations describing the radiological features and illustrating the diagnostic workup of patients with florid osseous dysplasia (FOD). Emphasis is given to the endodontic implications of such periapical bone disease and the complexity of accurate diagnosis in the context of endodontic retreatment. We then propose a practical radiological-based diagnostic algorithm to assist the clinician in the diagnostic of OD periapical lesions."
