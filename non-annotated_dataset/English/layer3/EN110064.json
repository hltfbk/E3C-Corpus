  "text": "A 57-year-old woman with a history of recurrent cystitis which has been treated with repeated courses of antibiotics during a 5-year period. She has been experiencing 2 months of bladder irritation, dysuria, urinary urgency and terminal hematuria with presence of blood clots. Physical examination showed pelvic tenderness. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a tumor of the right anterolateral wall of the urinary bladder that was confirmed by computing tomography (CT) scan. Cystoscopy showed an irregular, solid and ulcerative mass arising from the right wall of the bladder. Transurethral resection was performed and histology revealed a diffuse, dense infiltration of highly pleomorphic population of large cells. Tumors cells were strongly positive for CD79a, CD20 and bcl2 protein. The proliferative fraction of cells, as determined by Ki-67 staining was 70%. Immunohistochemical analyses were negative for cytokeratins and vimentine. This allowed us to retain the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There was no cervical, thoracic, abdominal or pelvic lesion in the CT scan. Bone marrow biopsy showed no abnormality. A complete blood count and routine blood chemistry were normal. The disease was classified stage IE according to the Ann Arbor Staging system and the patient had a score of 0 by using the international prognostic index (IPI). Six cycles of R-CHOP regimen (Rituximab 375 mg/ m 2, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/ m 2, doxorubicine 50 mg/m 2, vincristin 1.4 mg/ m 2 and prednisone 100 mg/day during 5 days; the protocol is repeated every 3 weeks) were given with complete response maintained after 48 months of follow up."
