  "text": "A lady in her late sixties presents with multiple pathologies of the head and neck that appear to be a direct consequence of irradiation performed as a young child when she was not expected to live for long. Some deformities resulted early after exposure, but most of the dozen pathologies in the affected area have evolved during the subsequent fifty years."
