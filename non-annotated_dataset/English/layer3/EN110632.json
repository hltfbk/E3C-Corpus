  "text": "We described 2 familial cases (a 20-year-old male and 61-year-old female) of severe necrotizing pneumonia caused by CA-MRSA with the TSST-1 and PVL genes. A 20-year-old Nepalese male was admitted to our hospital after a 3-day history of high fever and coughing. Despite resuscitation efforts, he died of multiple organ failure. A 61-year-old Nepalese female was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of high fever and dyspnea for 1 day. She was the grandmother of the male subject and mostly stayed at his residence in Japan. We administered intravenous antibiotics, including anti-MRSA antibiotics, and she improved in 2 weeks. The sequence type of the isolates was ST22/SCCmec type IVa, and the spa type was t005. The virulence genes detected were as follows: PVL gene (lukSF-pv), TSST-1 gene (tst-1), sec, seg, sei, sel, sem, sen, seo, and seu. ST22 was not the dominant CA-MRSA clone type in Japan. Some of the reports demonstrated that PVL-/TSST-1-positive ST22-MRSA strains are prevalent in Nepal. Therefore, the MRSA strains were thought to be acquired from Nepal."
