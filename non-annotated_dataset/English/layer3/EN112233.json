  "text": "A 17-year-old previously healthy Sinhalese schoolboy presented with high-grade fever associated with chills and rigors associated with loss of appetite and loss of weight for more than 40â€‰days. On examination, he had bilateral firm matted tender cervical lymphadenopathy and firm hepatomegaly. An excision biopsy of his right cervical lymph node revealed necrotizing lymphadenitis and immunohistochemistry of a lymph node biopsy favored Kikuchi disease. Initial antinuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid tests were negative and his C3 and C4 levels were normal. An infections screening was negative. He was treated with steroids. While in hospital he developed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and renal impairment. Later his antinuclear antibody titer became positive in 1:160 and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus. He was managed with steroids and immune suppressive drugs and showed remarkable improvement."
