  "text": "The patient was a 73-year-old Japanese man diagnosed as L, type 3, circ, T4aNxCy1P1M1, stage IV (the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma). The patient was treated with docetaxel, cisplatin, and TS-1 (DCS regimen). After two courses of the regimen, peritoneal dissemination disappeared, and peritoneal lavage cytology revealed no tumor cells in the abdominal cavity. Subsequently, he underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D1+. Pathological findings were ypT2(MP), ypN2(3/15), ypP0, ypCY0, M0, ypstage II. He received TS-1 as an adjuvant chemotherapy, but he had peritoneal recurrence. The original gastric cancer was HER2-positive. We therefore treated him with TS-1 with trastuzumab. This regimen was quite effective and achieved a complete response. After complete response, we switched the patient to trastuzumab monotherapy. He had no evidence of recurrence for 6 years, 3 months after surgery."
