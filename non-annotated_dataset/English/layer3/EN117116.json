  "text": "A 54-year-old woman was noted to have an abnormal shadow in the right middle lung field on chest X-ray. Computed tomography of the chest revealed an infiltrative lesion in the right segment 4 and a nodule in the right segment 8. She underwent right middle lobectomy and partial resection of the right segment 8. Histopathology revealed non-atypical lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrates, leading to the diagnosis of the lymphoplasmacytic type of inflammatory pseudotumor. During postoperative follow-up, chest computed tomography revealed a nodular lesion in the left segment 3 and an infiltrative lesion in the right segment 2. Left segment 3 segmentectomy and right segment 2 wedge resection were performed. The histopathological findings were similar to those of the first surgical specimen, leading to the diagnosis of recurrent lymphoplasmacytic type of inflammatory pseudotumor."
