  "text": "We present a case of upper limb PCD in a 67-year-old female secondary to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia caused by warfarin bridging. She presented to the orthopedic team with upper limb compartment syndrome from a bleed around a peripherally inserted central catheter, for which she was urgently taken to the theater for fasciotomies. Postoperatively, the patient's platelets dropped and the upper limb pain and swelling continued; after conservative management and anticoagulation failed the patient had an upper limb amputation of her right arm."
