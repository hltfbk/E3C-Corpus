  "text": "A 17-year-old previously healthy young man presented with several month duration of pain in the right leg below the knee with no prior trauma, overlying a site of chronic, culture-negative osteomyelitis which was successfully treated with anti-staphylococcal therapy 1year prior. Magnetic resonance imaging of the affected area revealed findings consistent with chronic osteomyelitis at his prior surgical site, while operative culture demonstrated growth of a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An extensive immunological evaluation was unremarkable. He demonstrated clinical and radiographic improvement following 4 months of intravenous antimicrobial therapy."
