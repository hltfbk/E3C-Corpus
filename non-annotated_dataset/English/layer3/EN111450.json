  "text": "In this study, we report on a 48-year-old man who presented with a 5 × 8 cm scrotal mass between his testes. Physical examination revealed a 4.7 × 8.5 cm lobulated tumor mass located between his testicles. Surgical excision of the tumor with scrotal approach was done and pathology reported a SFT. The patient was alive without tumor recurrence or distant metastasis during ongoing follow-up for 9 months post-operatively.."
