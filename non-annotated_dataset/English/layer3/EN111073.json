  "text": "We present a rare case of primary gastrointestinal histoplasmosis manifesting with acute granulomatous hepatitis and cholestasis in a 48-year-old female with psoriatic arthritis, receiving methotrexate and infliximab. The epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of histoplasmosis is discussed. Furthermore, we review the published cases of biopsy-proven disseminated histoplasmosis with cholestatic jaundice to highlight histoplasmosis involvement in the liver."
