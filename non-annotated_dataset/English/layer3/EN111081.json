  "text": "A 53-year old male forester and farmer with protracted fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and loss of weight, who experienced productive cough and a pulmonary infiltrate later in the course of disease, was admitted for further investigation. Tularaemia was suspected only owing to history and confirmed by serologic testing more than three weeks after the beginning of the symptoms. The initial antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone/doxycycline was switched to ciprofloxacin, resulting in the resolution of fever and symptoms."
