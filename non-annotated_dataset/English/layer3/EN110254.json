  "text": "A 79 year-old male presented to our institution complaining of a painful ulcerated skin lesion localized in the left lower eyelid. The patient's history found no comorbidities. On Physical examination, an ulcerated lesionextending to the left orbite was noted. A facial neck and chest computed tomography showed a large enhancing mass of the left maxillary sinus measuring 60x65mm with bilateral suspicious lung nodules. A biopsy of the mass was performed, histopathological examination revealed an infiltrative basal cell carcinoma. A diagnosis of a giant basal cell carcinoma metastatic to the lungs was established;the patient had an ECOG performance status of 2, a blood workup showed he had normal renal function. Platinum based chemotherapy was decided. He received only one course of 5FU-ceplatin then decided tointerrupt the treatment. Unfortunately he died one month after the beginning of treatment."
