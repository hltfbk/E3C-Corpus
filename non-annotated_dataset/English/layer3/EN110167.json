  "text": "A 44-year-old man presented acutely with a 1-day history of colicky central abdominal pain, abdominal distension, vomiting and absolute constipation. He had previous history of left segmental colectomy 4 months ago. Physical examination revealed dry mucous membranes and tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Bowel sounds were increased and digital rectal examination empty rectal pouch. Laboratory investigations revealed a leukocytosis of 12400/mm 3. Plain abdominal radiography demonstrated two prominent loops of small bowel in the left lower quadrant. Nasogastric tube was inserted and he was resuscitated with intravenous fluids. A computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen showed small intestinal obstruction caused by post-operative adhesion with dilated loops of small bowel. Based on his clinical and CT findings a decision was made to perform an exploratory laparotomy. At laparotomy, a mechanical small bowel obstruction due to an incarcerated internal hernia was found. A loop of ileum had herniated through a post-operative defect in the mesosigmoid. The herniated loop was reduced successfully and the defect was approximated with interrupted 3/ 0 poliglecaprone sutures. The strangulated portion of small bowel was found to be viable. In this case the hernial orifice measured 4.5 cm and consisted of two leaves of the sigmoid mesentery. No hernial sac was present."
