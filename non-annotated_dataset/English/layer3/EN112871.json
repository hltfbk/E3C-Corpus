  "text": "A healthy looking, 50-year-old Nepali man presented with multiple growths on his scrotum for 15 years, which were mostly asymptomatic with an occasional complaint of itching. On physical examination, multiple pink to brown nodules ranging in size from 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 cm to 3 × 3 × 1 cm, which were painless and firm in consistency, were noted. On laboratory examinations the following were found to be within normal limits: serum calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D hormone levels; uric acid; alkaline phosphatase; and lipid profile. Based on clinical features and laboratory reports, a diagnosis of idiopathic calcinosis cutis of the scrotum was made. The nodules were excised under local anesthesia in several sittings, which gave a good cosmetic result with no evidence of recurrence in 1-year follow-up period. A histopathological examination revealed dermis with areas of fibrosis and calcification along with numerous multinucleated giant cells and an absence of any cystic structure."
