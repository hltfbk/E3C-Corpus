  "text": "We report the case of a 49Â year-old woman affected by metastatic breast cancer who developed trastuzumab-related cardiogenic shock due to pump failure (with LVEF of about 15%) after three months of treatment. After a long hospitalization in the cardiac intensive care unit and a proper treatment, LVEF increased to 50% and, due to a severe progression of disease, trastuzumab was resumed and continued for more than one year."
