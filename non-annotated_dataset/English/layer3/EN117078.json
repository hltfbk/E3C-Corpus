  "text": "Four female patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia with inactivating mutations in the CaSR gene were included in the treatment study. Three patients were related: two were siblings and one was the daughter of one of these. The ages of the related patients were 51 years, 57 years and 35 years. All three patients were carriers of the same mutation. The fourth patient, unrelated to the others, was 53 years old, and a carrier of a novel and previously unknown mutation leading to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. All four patients were Caucasians of Danish nationality. Biochemically, all patients had elevated blood ionized calcium, serum parathyroid hormone, serum magnesium and total serum calcium, except one, whose serum parathyroid hormone was within the normal range prior to treatment. All patients were treated with cinacalcet in a dosage of 30 mg to 60 mg per day."
