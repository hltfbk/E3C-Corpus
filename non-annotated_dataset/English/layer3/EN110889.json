  "text": "The case presented is of a 6-year-old Caucasian boy with an impacted and displaced radial neck fracture. With the patient in lateral position, under general anesthesia, elbow arthroscopy was performed to better visualize the articular surface and to assist with reduction and fixation. The fracture was reduced and fixed with a single K-wire under direct arthroscopic visualization. No associated lesions were found. An above-elbow cast was applied after surgery. The cast and K-wire were removed 3 weeks later. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient showed a full recovery with complete range of movement without any postoperative and radiographic complications."
