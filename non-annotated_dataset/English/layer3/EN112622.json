  "text": "A 48-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with ipsilateral distal ureteral calculi and ipsilateral lower calyceal calculi. One year prior to this admission, the patient had undergone Yang-Monti ileal ureter reconstruction due to long-segment ureteral stenosis. After conservative treatment failed, we used a rigid ureteroscope with a holmium laser to break up the distal ureteral calculi, and successfully removed the renal calculi with a digital flexible ureteroscope and basket extractor."
