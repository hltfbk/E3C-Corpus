  "text": "We present a case of a professional wrestler who suffered from anterior shoulder instability after sustaining a bony Bankart lesion without loss of glenoid surface area but flattening of the concavity due to medialization of the fragment. The patient's glenoid concavity was reconstructed arthroscopically by reduction and percutaneous screw fixation of the bony fragment along with a capsulo-ligamentous shift. Changes of the glenoid concavity with according alterations in the Bony Shoulder Stability Ratio (BSSR) were analyzed on pre-op, post-op, and follow-up CT scans. Postoperative CT scans revealed a deepened concavity (3.3 mm) and improved BSSR (46.1 %) compared to pre-op scans (0.7 mm; 11.3 %). Follow-up CT scans showed a slight remodeling of the glenoid concavity (3.2 mm) with steady BSSR (44.7 %)."
