  "text": "A 22-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a history of intermittent colicky right hypochondrial pain not relieved by any medications for the past 3â€‰months. Initially, she was given proton pump inhibitors, but her pain was not relieved. Further evaluation was done, and preoperative imaging showed a cyst in the second part of the duodenum. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed it as a choledochocele, but duodenal duplication cyst was kept in the differential diagnosis. Further ultrasound identified it to be a duplication cyst. After failed endotreatment, the patient was successfully managed with partial excision and marsupialization."
