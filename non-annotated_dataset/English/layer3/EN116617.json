  "text": "We describe two cases of STS who presented with DVT and PE. Physical and radiographic examination only showed the presence of DVT. Both patients were treated for DVT or PE for several months. Due to the persistence of symptoms and the inefficacy of anticoagulant therapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which revealed the presence of a lower limb mass in both cases. The definite diagnosis was reached via excisional biopsy and histological examination.In one case, MRI showed a large tumor in the anterior muscle compartment of the right thigh, with thrombosis of the right common femoral vein and involvement of the ipsilateral common iliac vein and inferior vena cava until the confluence of the renal veins. In the other case, MRI showed a large tumor in the middle third of the right thigh. The lesion was in close proximity to the superficial femoral vein that appeared compressed and showed signs of thrombosis. In both cases, histological examination revealed a high-grade leiomyosarcoma."
