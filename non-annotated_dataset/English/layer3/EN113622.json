  "text": "We present the case of a 42-year-old female who was operated at our institution previously 7 years ago for melorheostosis of her left knee and had undergone excision of intrarticular hyperostotic masses. However, pain and limitation of motion recurred in the operated knee 4 years later, and radiographs and computed tomography revealed a mineralized mass situated behind the patella in the patellofemoral joint. She was treated with repeat open excision of the mass and put on a regimen of physiotherapy and bisphosphonates."
