  "text": "Here we present three cases of pregnancy complicated with MOGCTs. The first case (immature teratoma) was complicated by maternal psychological symptoms consistent with stress and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure (POF). The second case (dysgerminoma) preterm labour occurred as an obstetric complication, but the baby was born in good condition without IUGR. The third case (yolk sac tumour) treated with docetaxel (brexel)-carboplatin chemotherapy administration there was no maternal or fetal complication. At the end of the pregnancy and delivery, complete surgical staging and cytoreduction were performed, and no metastases were found."
