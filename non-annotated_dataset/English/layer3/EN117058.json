  "text": "Five weeks following blunt trauma to the left eye (OS), a 30-year-old patient presented complaining of spontaneous blurred vision (4/60) in the right eye (OD). In the OD, there was anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation (3+), multiple areas of serous retinal detachments, Dalen Fuchs spots, and optic disk swelling. In the OS, there was iridodialysis, post-traumatic acquired external ocular pigmentation suggestive of occult globe rupture.                         This was diagnosed as SO and treated with systemic steroids and a steroid sparing agent; which resulted in resolution of the inflammation with improvement in the visual acuity."
