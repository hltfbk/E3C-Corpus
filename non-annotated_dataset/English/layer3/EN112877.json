  "text": "A 31-year-old Mestizo-Mexican woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presented with severe diabetic ketoacidosis, shortly after initiating a multi-drug immunosuppressive therapy. She did not meet the diagnostic criteria for type 1 or type 2 diabetes and had no family history of hyperglycemic states. She persisted with hyperglycemia and high insulin requirements until the discontinuation of cyclophosphamide. After this episode, she recovered her endogenous insulin production and the antidiabetic agents were successfully withdrawn. After 1 year of follow up she is still normoglycemic."
