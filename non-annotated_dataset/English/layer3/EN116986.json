  "text": "A 53-year-old woman had undergone toric implantable collamer lens implantation three years earlier. After informed consent was obtained, we performed simultaneous toric implantable collamer lens removal and phacoemulsification with toric intraocular lens implantation. Preoperatively, the manifest refraction was 0, -0.5 × 15, with an uncorrected visual acuity of 0.7 and a best spectacle-corrected visual acuity of 0.8. Postoperatively, the manifest refraction was improved to 0, -0.5 × 180, with an uncorrected visual acuity of 1.2 and a best spectacle-corrected visual acuity of 1.5. No vision-threatening complications were observed."
