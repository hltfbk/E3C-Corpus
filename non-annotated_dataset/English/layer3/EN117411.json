  "text": "Here we report on a 58-year-old woman with multiple primary malignancies and subtle mucocutaneous lesions such as small polyps and wart-like papulas. Over a period of 23 years, she developed various malignant neoplasms including thyroid, ovarian, stomach, and colon carcinomas, and a benign meningioma. Direct sequencing analysis of the PTEN gene revealed a novel germline mutation (c.438delT, p.Leu146X)."
