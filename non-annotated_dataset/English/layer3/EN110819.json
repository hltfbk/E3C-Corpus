  "text": "We report the case of a 63-year-old Caucasian man with a history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation who presented for syncope. Inpatient ischemic workup, including coronary angiography, demonstrated a rare coronary anomaly which included all three coronary arteries arising from a shared, single, ostium originating from the right coronary cusp. Our patient was treated conservatively with an option for coronary bypass if symptomatic."
