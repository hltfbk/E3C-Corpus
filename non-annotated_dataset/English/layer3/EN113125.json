  "text": "A 55-year-old female patient presented with epigastric pain in our emergency room. Laboratory parameters showed an anemia as well as elevated transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia. The CT scan showed an intussusception of the remnant stomach into the duodenum followed by cholestasis. At laparotomy the remnant stomach was resected."
