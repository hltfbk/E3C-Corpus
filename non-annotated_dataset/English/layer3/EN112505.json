  "text": "This report describes a Chinese patient with severe hyperthyroidism accompanied by multiorgan failure, who was transferred to the medical intensive care unit of our hospital. The patient presented with palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea, and shortness of breath for a week. Laboratory tests showed elevation of thyroid hormones. Hepatic failure occurred with high aminotransferase levels and jaundice. Given her abnormal liver function and medication history, we could not exclude diagnosis of propylthiouracil-induced hepatic failure. Moreover, she also suffered from heart failure. Therapeutic plasma exchange (commonly known as TPE) and continuous renal replacement therapy (commonly known as CRRT) were used as life-saving therapy, which resulted in notable improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory tests."
