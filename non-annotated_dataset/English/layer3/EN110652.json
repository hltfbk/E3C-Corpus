  "text": "A 21-year-old male of Iranian origin and known case of Evans syndrome, was referred to our hospital for better evaluation. Evans syndrome was presented with acute jaundice, purpura, petechiae, and easy bruising when he was 9.He was under treatment of corticosteroid and cytotoxic agents, and presented with left lower extremity paresis for 5 months before admission to our hospital. According to neuroimaging and pathologic results, multiple sclerosis (MS) was diagnosed. Hence, we decided to treat the patient with rituximab. The patient has been stable without any further exacerbation or increase in disability progression after 2 years from diagnosis."
