  "text": "A 53-year-old German woman underwent left lateral suboccipital retrosigmoidal craniectomy for treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in 2008. Cranioplasty was perfomed by using a mixture of autologous bone chips and human allogenic fibrin glue. Due to recurrent neuralgia, a second left lateral suboccipital craniectomy was performed in 2012. The intraoperative findings revealed a complete ossification of the former craniotomy including widely mature trabecular bone tissue in the histological examination."
