  "text": "He is a nine-year-old patient, living in a rural area, with no particular pathological history. He consulted in hematology for subacute, poorly systemic abdominal pain of moderate intensity, without notion of digestive disorders, evolving for 15 days, in an apyretic context without alteration of the general condition. The physical examination noted hepatomegaly, with a slight helpless peri-umbilical pain without dermatological lesion or neurological disorders. The hemogram showed an increase in leukocytes at 34,400/μL, with increased eosinophilia at 23,000/μL, motivating the etiological research of the increase of eosinophils, through the realization of a thoracic radiography and an examination of the stools, not finding anomalies. Only the toxocara serology was positive with 43 μL of Toxocara canis IgG, with confirmation of the presence of anti-toxocara canis antibodies. An abdominal ultrasound, performed as part of the lesion assessment objectified the presence of multiple heterogeneous hypoechogenic areas scattered all over the liver. The largest of which was localized at the level of segment VIII, associated with hepatic peri-hilar lymphadenopathy and peri-splenic. On color Doppler, these areas were poorly vascularized. The complementary abdominal CT scan; allowed to better characterize the lesions of the liver, by finding multiple scattered lesions, badly limited on acquisitions not injected, not enhanced and better seen after injection of contrast product at arterial and venous times; crossed by the portal branches, consistent with the radiological characteristics of liver damage by the larva migrans digestive toxocara. The child was started on albendazol tablet therapy, but was non-observant."
