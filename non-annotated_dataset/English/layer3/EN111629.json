  "text": "A 47-year-old patient fell from a height of 4â€‰m and was paralyzed. Computed tomography scan revealed a three-column ligamentous injury with posterior fracture-dislocation of the L3 vertebral body. Computed tomography angiography showed that the third lumbar artery was ruptured without active bleeding. The patient underwent posterior approach with reduction, transpedicular fixation, and posterolateral fusion with autologous bone graft. Finally, Vertebral reduction and sagittal balance were achieved and patients recovered well after operation."
