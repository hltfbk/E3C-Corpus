  "text": "We report a case of internal hernia in a 61-year-old male of Japanese ethnicity. The patient had advanced sigmoid colon cancer, early-stage transverse colon cancer, and multiple adenomatous polyposis, and underwent laparoscopically-assisted subtotal colectomy. Bowel obstruction developed six days postoperatively and did not improve with conservative treatment. Abdominal computed tomography detected an internal hernia, prompting emergency surgery in which the ileum protruding into the mesenteric defect and an anastomotic stricture were detected. Reanastomosis, mesentery closure, and ileostomy were performed after hernia repair."
