  "text": "We herein report a case of intraosseous IMT of the mandible with a novel ATIC-ALK fusion. Tooth 43 did not erupt after the loss of tooth 83 in an 11-year-old girl with no previous history of trauma. Panoramic tomography showed a unilocular radiolucent lesion in the right anterior mandible resorbing the root of tooth 42 and the medial side of the root of tooth 44. Computed tomography revealed a well- circumscribed 3-cm osteolytic lesion of the right anterior mandible eroding the buccal cortical plate. The entire lesion was curetted out. A histopathological examination revealed the proliferation of plump spindle cells with a storiform architecture and lymphocytes scattered around spindle cells. The spindle cells showed diffuse cytoplasmic staining for ALK by immunohistochemistry. A fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed the translocation of a part of the ALK gene locus at chromosome 2p23. A rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis confirmed the rearrangement of ALK and identified ATIC as a partner of this ALK fusion mutant."
