  "text": "We report two cases of patients with congenital abnormal left ventricular muscle bundles which caused disturbances in intraventricular hemodynamics. This process eventually led to a left ventricular aneurysm at the apex of the heart. In both cases, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) indicated ventricular aneurysm formation at the apex of the left ventricle. There were also abnormal muscular bundles connecting the ventricular septum and the posterior wall of the left ventricle. The only differences between these two cases were the comorbidities and severity of symptoms."
