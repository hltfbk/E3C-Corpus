  "text": "A series of two patients are described who underwent intramedullary flexible nails and external fixation for a closed unstable midshaft femur fracture: An 8-year-old male that sustained a left periprosthetic femur fracture after a fall on his scooter, and a 5-year-old female that sustained a right femur fracture after a fall from a wet decking. Both patients had their external fixator removed after 4 weeks and achieved radiographic and clinical fracture union at 8-week postoperatively."
