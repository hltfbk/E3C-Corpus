  "text": "We present a case with positive BRCA1 mutation who underwent the prophylactic procedure where a small mass was identified in her fallopian tube. Our initial encounter with this tumor was during intraoperative consultation. The tumor was associated with extensive psammoma bodies arranged in closely packed small tubules, mimicking serous carcinoma. Frozen section limitations including artifact, time constraint, and lack of ancillary studies as well as the clinical history further complicated our diagnostic assessment, which was deferred. A diagnosis of adenomatoid tumor was rendered on permanent sections."
