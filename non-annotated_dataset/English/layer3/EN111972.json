  "text": "The 15-year-old girl underwent cortical mastoidectomy under general anesthesia. After a smooth anesthesia and an uneventful early recovery, she developed hyperventilation after about 15â€‰min in the PACU. The symptom was severe enough to lead to apnea, desaturation and severe respiratory alkalosis. She required bag and mask ventilation and the symptoms resolved only transiently with propofol sedation. Finally, she responded to intravenous haloperidol and did not have any further episode after receiving haloperidol."
