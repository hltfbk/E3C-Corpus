  "text": "We report a case of a 28 years old woman, in 33 week of her first pregnancy who came to our hospital complaining of abdominal pain in the right hemiabdomen, associated with nausea and vomiting. The ultrasound and MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) scan showed a 7 x 7 x 5 cm mass suggestive of angiomyolipoma in the right kidney, with evidence of retroperitoneal bleeding right perirenal and intrarenal haematoma. Given the size of the tumor, presence of symptoms and hemodynamic instability of the patient right nephrectomy was performed, following emergency caesarean delivery. The histological study of the resected mass revealed the presence of angiomyolipoma."
