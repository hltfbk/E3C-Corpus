  "text": "Two cases of leptospirosis are presented here. The clinical picture differed from a real Weil's disease in the first case and from a neuro-leptospirosis in the second. However, both patients underwent liver transplantation because of the severity of the associated acute liver failure. Unfortunately, one of the cases had a fatal outcome."
