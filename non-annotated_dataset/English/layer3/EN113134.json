  "text": "A 41-year-old Chinese man who had pre-existing pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with daily hyperpyrexia and cough. Following a fungal culture from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), the patient was diagnosed with T. marneffei infection. A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest scan revealed bilateral lung diffuse miliary nodules, multiple patchy exudative shadows in the bilateral superior lobes and right inferior lobes, air bronchogram in the consolidation of the right superior lobe, multiple hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathies and local pleural thickening. After 3 mos of antifungal therapy, the patient's pulmonary symptoms rapidly disappeared, and the physical condition improved markedly. A subsequent CT re-examination demonstrated that foci were absorbed remarkably after treatment. The patient is receiving follow-up therapy and assessment for a cure."
