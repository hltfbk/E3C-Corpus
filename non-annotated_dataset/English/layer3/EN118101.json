  "text": "On per speculum examination, cervix was replaced by an irregular friable growth, which was bleeding on touch. A clinical diagnosis of carcinoma cervix was made but the cervical biopsy revealed granulomatous inflammation with presence of acid-fast bacilli on cervical smear consistent with tuberculosis. The patient responded to six months of anti-tubercular therapy."
