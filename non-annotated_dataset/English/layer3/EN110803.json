  "text": "We report the case of a 48-year-old man of African descent presenting with generalized tonic-clonic seizure and coma secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy. A biochemical evaluation revealed a very high aldosterone level and an undetectable renin level, both are compatible with primary aldosteronism. The presentation of the following confirms the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism: spontaneous hypokalemia, an undetectable renin level, and a high aldosterone level. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a left adrenal adenoma. Adrenal venous sampling confirmed lateralization of aldosterone excretion from the left adrenal gland. Our patient underwent left laparoscopic adrenalectomy that confirmed a left functional adrenal adenoma. After 12â€‰months of follow up, his hypertension was controlled on only one antihypertensive drug which was down from four drugs preoperatively."
