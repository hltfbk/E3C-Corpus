  "text": "We herein reported a case of a perforated obturator hernia with a femoral abscess that was successfully treated via repair using the pectineus muscle. An 84-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with appetite loss and right femoral pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a right obturator hernia and abscess spreading to the right thigh. Emergency surgery was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed that the abscess had formed because of a perforation in the small intestine by an incarcerated obturator hernia. We performed partial resection of the small intestine, repaired the hernial orifice, drained the right femoral abscess, and filled the cavity using the pectineus muscle. A residual abscess was not detectable following surgery, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 63."
