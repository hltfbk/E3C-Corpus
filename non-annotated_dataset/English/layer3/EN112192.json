  "text": "A 9-month old boy presented with swelling on the left upper arm and adjoining the chest area, low-grade continuous fever, frequent passage of loose watery stool and persistent cries 24â€‰h after measles vaccine was administered on the left upper arm. On examination, he was mildly pale, febrile, anicteric. Extensive erythema of the left upper arm occurred thereafter with extensive scalded skin lesions involving the deltoid area, the upper chest wall and arm. This was followed by desquamation of the affected areas and severe necrosis. A diagnosis of severe necrotizing fasciitis was made. A causality assessment was conducted by the state AEFI committee using the detailed AEFI investigation forms to identify the cause of the incidence."
