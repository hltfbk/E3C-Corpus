  "text": "A 74-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis presented to the emergency room with abdominal discomfort, rectal pain, and blood-tinged stools. Initial concern was for a rectal carcinoma, based on the symptoms and imaging in initial computerized tomography of the abdomen showing rectal wall thickening, and her clinical presentation. She had been treated with the phosphate binder sevelamer for two months. In this case report, we explore the unique features of sevelamer-associated recto-sigmoid ulcers which led to her symptoms."
