  "text": "A 27-year-old female with the right 3rd metacarpal shaft fracture caused by falling down while riding a bicycle. The patient was a professional ballet dancer and requested treatment enabling an early return to exercise and non-noticeable wound. Pins were percutaneously inserted antegradely and retrogradely to the metacarpal bone as intramedullary pinning, then were connected using locked wires fixator. Post-operative immobilization was not necessary. The locked wire fixator was removed 6 weeks after surgery. Postoperatively, there were no limitations of the range of motion of the finger joints and the operative scar was almost unrecognizable."
