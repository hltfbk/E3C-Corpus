  "text": "A 2 week-old Caucasian, male infant was referred for congenital feet abnormalities and a \"clicky\" hip at the post-natal baby check. The diagnosis was vertical talus of the right foot and oblique talus of the left foot. Treatment involved serial plaster casts in the \"reverse-Ponseti\" position until surgery 16 weeks later. The correction was maintained and the feet remain in good position at follow-up. General concern over the infant's development, failing to reach appropriate milestones, prompted paediatric referral. Genetic analysis was finally carried out, giving a diagnosis of Cri du Chat syndrome at two and a half years of age."
