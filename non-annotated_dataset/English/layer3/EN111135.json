  "text": "We report a 12 year old girl who complained of recurrent episodes of chest pain lasting for some minutes and not associated to exercise. Echocardiography revealed AAOLCA from the right aortic sinus taking a subpulmonic course within the conal septum. The diagnosis was confirmed by CT-scan and selective coronary angiography. Treadmill test, Holter-ECG and bicycle-stress echocardiography revealed no evidence of myocardial ischemia reflecting unimpaired diastolic flow in the left coronary artery. According to the nature of the complaints and in the absence of signs of myocardial ischemia the episodes of chest pain were classified as idiopathic and not associated to the coronary anomaly. We opted for a conservative approach with regular follow-up visits. During a follow-up of 2 years without restriction of sports activities the patient has been asymptomatic."
