  "text": "We report a Chinese TSC family with two siblings presenting with multiple hypomelanotic macules, cardiac rhabdomyomas and cortical tubers associated with a small subependymal nodule. The older child had seizures. A novel heterozygous missense variant in the TSC2 gene (c.899G > T, p.G300 V) was identified and shown to be inherited from their father as well as paternal grandfather, both of whom presented with variable TSC-associated signs and symptoms."
