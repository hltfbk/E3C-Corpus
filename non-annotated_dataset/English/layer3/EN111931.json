  "text": "Here, we reported a rare case of a proximal duodenum pedunculated mass measuring about 7â€‰cm which was responsible for the patient's severe anemia. we treated it as a pedunculated polyp. After being pretreated the stalk with an endoloop which was placed around the base of the mass to prevent post-polypectomy bleeding (PPB), the pedunculated BGH was removed by HSP completely. The stalk of the mass was negative. We achieved a curative resection."
