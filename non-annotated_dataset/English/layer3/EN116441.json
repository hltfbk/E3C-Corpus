  "text": "We report a case of a 64-year-old Caucasian woman with a rapidly progressive two-and-a-half-year history of a hypokinetic Parkinson's syndrome with asymmetric development of symptoms and an initially good response to levodopa medication. Due to side effects of other dopamimetic medications the patient was switched to rotigotine medication five weeks before clinical admission. Progressive antecollis without muscle weakness and prominent paraspinal muscle contraction developed within two weeks of treatment and resolved within a week after discontinuation of rotigotine and initiation of levodopa/cabergoline medication."
