  "text": "A 70-year-old man developed ileus after a few days of medication for hypertension. Computed tomography incidentally revealed a left adrenal mass. This finding together with his clinical course was compatible with pheochromocytoma. An α-blocker was administered immediately, and his blood pressure was well controlled. However, his general condition and laboratory data deteriorated rapidly, and the patient was diagnosed with PMC with lethal status. Thus, emergency adrenalectomy was performed without confirmation of catecholamine levels. From the resected specimen, his tumor was judged as pheochromocytoma. On immunohistochemical analysis, the proliferation index evaluated by Ki-67 staining was 9.7 %. This case report was approved by the Human Ethics Review Committee of the Nagasaki University Hospital."
