  "text": "A twelve-year-old boy was referred to our orthopedic surgical department for a surgical site infection complicating an initial surgical management of a left ingrown big toenail leading to a dry gangrene of the affected toe. The gangrene toe was amputated under peripheral nerve block and the patient was discharged home the same day on antibiotics, analgesics and with sessions of rehabilitation and psychological support planned. The postoperative course was uneventful at 6 months of follow-up."
