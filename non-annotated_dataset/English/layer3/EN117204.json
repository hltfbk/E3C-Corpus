  "text": "A 25-year-old Arabic woman presented to our emergency department with rapid onset of headache, flaring acne and hirsutism, facial puffiness, weight gain and paroxysmal myopathy, and paranoiac thoughts of rape and sexual intimidation. After undergoing surgical removal of a mass by left lower lung lobectomy, her residual lung disease medical therapy failed. Chronic octreotide LAR injections were initiated as indicated by a positive octreoscan.Follow-up revealed a long-lasting positive response to octreotide. Avidity of octreotide to somatostatin receptor sub-type 2 was later confirmed by a positive somatostatin receptor sub-type 2 in the resected tumor specimen. Against our instructions, the patient had three spontaneous pregnancies leading to delivery of three full-term healthy children while her octreotide LAR therapy continued."
