  "text": "We present a case report of a 38-year-old Persian woman with acute abdominal pain and a history of uterine fibroids. The patient refused to undergo a laparoscopic myomectomy. Her ultrasound examination revealed free fluid in the abdominal cavity, and her vital signs were indicative of vasogenic shock. A diagnostic laparoscopy was performed to identify and control the source of bleeding: 400â€‰ml of blood and blood clots were removed. Active bleeding was seen from a vein overlying a subserosal myoma. A laparotomic myomectomy was performed, and the patient was discharged 3 days after surgery with no complications."
