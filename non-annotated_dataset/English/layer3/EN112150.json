  "text": "We report a case of a 23-year-old man who sustained a cervical SCI during the wrestling competition. He was quadriplegic with no sensory or motor function preserved in sacral segments S4-S5. Conventional radiographs and computed tomography did not reveal bony abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a free herniated cervical disc severely compressing the spinal cord from central at C3/4 level. He underwent anterior cervical discectomy and interbody fusion using autologous iliac crest bone graft and fixation with the cervical plate. He made an eventful recovery, and 5 years later, he was playing at high competitive level."
