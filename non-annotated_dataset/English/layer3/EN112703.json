  "text": "A 67-year-old woman presented with a 46 × 25-mm tumor on her lower gingiva, along with metastatic foci in BN and cervical lymph nodes. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, she underwent radical resection of the primary tumor and BN, along with neck dissection. Following surgery, she received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Two years after treatment, there has been no evidence of tumor recurrence or metastasis."
