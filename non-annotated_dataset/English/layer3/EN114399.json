  "text": "We describe a LHON-MS patient with 27 years disease duration who developed severe disease activity peaking 14 months after discontinuation of natalizumab, with extensive new inflammatory lesions throughout the brain and in the spinal cord resembling immune inflammatory reconstitution syndrome. She had previously been clinically and radiologically stable on natalizumab treatment for 6 years, and before that only experienced subtle clinical activity during 9 years on interferon beta1a."
