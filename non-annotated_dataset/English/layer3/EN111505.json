  "text": "We report the case of a 15-year-old boy who presented to the hospital due to recurrent orthopnea for 6 mo and palpitations for 4 mo. He was diagnosed with progressive muscular dystrophy at the age of 3 years and was confined to a wheelchair at 12 years. He was prescribed diuretics and digoxin at the outpatient clinic; however, his symptoms did not resolve. Sacubitril/valsartan was added 1 mo prior to presentation, but he experienced recurrent episodes of palpitations. The electrocardiogram showed atrial tachycardia with a heart rate of 201 bpm, and he was then hospitalized. Hypotension was found following the administration of sacubitril/valsartan tablets; he could not tolerate even a small dose, always developing tachyarrhythmia. His symptoms were relieved after discontinuing sacubitril/valsartan, and his heart rate was controlled by a small dose of metoprolol tartrate and digoxin. Atrial tachycardia spontaneously converted in this patient, and his symptoms attenuated in the following 6 mo, without palpitation episodes."
