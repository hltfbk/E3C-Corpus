  "text": "A 46-year-old woman without any known comorbidities presented with a three-month history of continuous pain in the right shoulder and chest. The physical examination showed significant facial oedema, erythema and engorgement of the jugular veins. There was evident collateral venous circulation. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a solid anterior mediastinal mass measuring 50 x 40 x 35mm in intimate contact with mediastinal vascular structures without cleavage plane and sternal commitment. Serum markers (including alpha-fetoprotein - human choriogonadotropin (HCG) - CA-19-9), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and myasthenia gravis markers were negative.\nTwo incisional biopsies were performed (pre-sternal - right VATS). When videothoracoscopy was performed lung involvement was observed either by adhesions or tumor infiltration. Histology demonstrated a basaloid thymic carcinoma, with no lymphovascular invasion. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells demonstrated positive reactivity to CK 5/6, CKAE1AE3, p63 and a Ki67 index of 30%.\nDistant metastasis had not occurred, but surgical resection was impossible because of invasion of surrounding organs including the sternum, trachea and large vessels. The patient received 4 series of platin based chemotherapy (doxorubicin 80 mgiv, cisplatin 80 mgiv and cyclophosphamide 800 mg iv), and the following post treatment CT-scan showed no response. Patient was then treated with carboplatin (320mg/week) plus paclitaxel (85mg/week) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles and concurrent radiation therapy (6120 GyE / 180 GyE). After the first cycle of this second line radio-chemotherapy the symptoms of superior venous cava (SVC) syndrome gradually improved. The patient experienced toxicity: alopecia, asthenia, neutropenia and thrombosis of neck vessels. After completing treatment, a new CT showed a significant downsizing of the mediastinal mass with approximately an 81% reduction in tumor size. However the tumor remained in close contact with vascular structures without a clear separation line. No sternal involvement was observed. The remaining tissue did not show FDG accumulation during FDG-PET.\nThe multidisciplinary evaluation of the case concluded that the residual mass could not be removed with clear margins. The process would require SVC replacement and completeness of resection in the mediastinum down beside and behind the aorta would improbably achieved. The differential diagnosis between non neoplastic fibrosis and remaining tumor was not definitive as the PET scan did not show FDG accumulation and the cost-effectiveness of a surgical exploration was not considered favourable. The patient was alive and with good performance status and no recurrence of symptoms 2 years after the initial diagnosis."
