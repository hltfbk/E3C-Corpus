  "text": "Two similar cases according to the classification of Judet-Letournel acetabulum fractures were chosen. Case 1 is a male 55 years old, injured in a motor vehicle accident who had a pelvic fracture, especially a quadrilateral surface fracture in conjunction with high anterior column fracture. Case 2 is also a male 58 years old, who fall from height, had almost the same fracture type according to Judet-Letournel classification. The traditional reconstruction plate was used in case1 and the new anatomical suprapectineal plate system was used for internal fixation in case 2."
