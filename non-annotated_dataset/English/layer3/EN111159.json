  "text": "This case report presented a 31-year-old woman with complaints of spontaneous swelling and pain in the right maxillary lateral tooth. With the aid of cone-beam computed tomography, type III dens invaginatus with apical periodontitis was diagnosed and confirmed. Three-visit endodontic treatment was performed. In the first visit, the invagination was carefully removed under the dental operation microscope, and chemomechanical preparation was done. In the second visit, mineral trioxide aggregate apical barrier surgery was performed in this tooth. In the third visit, the canal was finally obturated with thermoplastic gutta-percha to recover the crown morphology. A 26-mo follow-up revealed a satisfied outcome both in the radiographic and oral examinations."
