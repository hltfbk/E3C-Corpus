  "text": "An eleven month old male child of Moroccan origin presented to our genetic consultation with severe symptoms that included hypotonia, fever, vision loss and feeding difficulties. He was suffering from the 4th month of life. Krabbe disease was suspected. Galactocerebrosidase deficiency was confirmed by biochemical analysis. DNA sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous compound mutation in GALC gene. The child was compounded with two mutations c.860G > A; p.Cys287Tyr and c.1622G > A; p.Trp541*."
