  "text": "A 44-year-old woman with 5-year history of Basedow's disease underwent a total thyroidectomy. She did not have a goiter. TRAb, TSAb, TPOAg and TgAb were all positive before a total thyroidectomy. In histopathological macroscopic examination, diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was observed. Furthermore, in histopathological microscopic examination, both characteristics of Basedow's disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis were observed. After a total thyroidectomy, titers of all thyroid-associated autoimmune antibodies were markedly reduced."
