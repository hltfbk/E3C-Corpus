  "text": "A 33-year-old man with no medical past history, victim of a right leg trauma resulting in a closed tibial shaft fracture initially treated on the 4 th of May 2020 in orthopedic surgery by a centro-medullary nailing. On the 6 th of May he presented an acute respiratory distress with fever (40.1°C) of which then a high-resolution chest computed tomography (CT) was performed, showing bilateral ground-glass opacities, with multilobe central and peripheral involvement. Given the current pandemic context, the patient was suspected of having a respiratory infection with SARS-CoV-2 and was transferred to the intensive care unit dedicated to the management of COVID-19. On admission, the clinical evaluation revealed a normal neurological and hemodynamic state, the respiratory rate was at 40, the oxygen saturation at 52% without oxygen, and at 96% with high-concentration mask. Arterial blood gas analysis showed respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia, arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2) at 55 mmHg. The initial conditioning included, a peripheral intravenous line (PIV), a high-concentration oxygen mask, a half-seated position (45°). Biological assessment had revealed an important inflammatory syndrome with high CRP at 277 mg/L, a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/L, hematocrit at 30% and hypoalbuminemia at 33 g/L without lymphopenia nor hyperferritinemia. The troponin level was high at 82.1 μg/L and CPK at 375 mg/l. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We also noted a drop in total cholesterol to 1.22 g/L and a low HDL level at 0.33 g/L. The renal and hepatic function, the electrolytes and the plasma procalcitonin were moreover without particularity."
