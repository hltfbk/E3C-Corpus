  "text": "We report a case of a 16-year-old boy suffering from persistent epiphora and a mild pain in the area of median canthus, due to a bone density mass within the right ethmoid air cells extending to the ipsilateral right orbit. The mass was removed via an external ethmoidectomy approach. Histopathologic examination of the specimen set the diagnosis of OO. One year after the operation the patient is free of symptoms, while no recurrence occurred."
