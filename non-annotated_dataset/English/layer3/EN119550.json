  "text": "We present an unusual case of CCSTA overlying the scapular region and with secondary osseous extension in the lower scapula. The patient underwent a wide local excision with removal of the tumor and the lower two thirds of the scapula. He had no local recurrences but he developed lung metastases after 5 months in spite of postoperative chemotherapy. He finally died ten months later."
