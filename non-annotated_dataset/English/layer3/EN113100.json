  "text": "A 56-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and no known prior history of systemic lupus erythematosus or depression presented with suicidal ideations, joint pains and a malar rash after a recent change in her Adalimumab dose. She was treated for an acute ATIL episode based on her symptoms and serologies which were positive for anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody. An inpatient psychiatric consultation determined that the patient's suicidal ideations may be an associated symptom of her current ATIL episode or possibly secondary to her chronic pain and debilitation from her RA. The patient's Adalimumab was discontinued and she was treated with a course of intravenous glucocorticoid. The patient's suicidal ideations resolved and her anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody serologies became negative. She was subsequently started on Abatacept and has achieved remission of her RA with no further suicidal ideations."
