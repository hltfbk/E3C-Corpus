  "text": "We present the case of an extensive limb-threatening DVT in a patient with previously undiagnosed MTS, resulting after internal fixation of a left tibial plateau fracture. Four days after surgery, despite standard prophylactic anticoagulation, the patient developed an extensive occlusive DVT, extending from the common iliac vein to the popliteal vein. Successful diagnosis required a CT venogram in addition to standard lower extremity ultrasound exam. Severe lower extremity edema continued to worsen despite formal anticoagulation. Urgent mechanical thrombolysis was undertaken, followed by staged catheter-directed thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) and intraluminal stenting. Following this treatment, the patient was noted to have gradual but dramatic resolution of his lower extremity edema and swelling."
