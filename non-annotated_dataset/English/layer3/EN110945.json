  "text": "A 68-year-old Japanese male with sudden onset of abdominal pain was clinically diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation, and an emergency abdominal operation was performed. A diverticulum with rupture was found in the sigmoid colon, but no apparent tumor was observed. Histological examination revealed bland spindle cells flatly proliferating and diffusely replacing the muscularis propria at the diverticular structure. The spindle cells were positive for KIT, DOG1, and CD34. Mutational analysis of the c-kit gene revealed that the lesion had a heterozygous deletion of 2 amino acids at codons 557 and 558 of exon 11. The mutation was not observed in the normal mucosa of the surrounding tissue."
