  "text": "We describe the case of a 42-year-old, previously healthy Sri Lankan Sinhalese man who developed acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis following dengue virus infection. He was transferred to our institution with a five-day history of fever, headache, myalgia, impaired level of consciousness, and reduced urinary output. He was hemodynamically stable and did not have evidence of plasma leakage. His serology for dengue immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G was positive, and biochemical investigations disclosed evidence of rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. He was treated with induced alkaline diuresis and hemodialysis, and he experienced an uncomplicated recovery."
