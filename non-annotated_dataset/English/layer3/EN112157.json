  "text": "A 62-year-old lady presented with complaints of painless bleeding per rectum and a fleshy mass protruding from the anal canal which on digital rectal examination appeared a large soft velvety flat mass with mucus discharge. Colonoscopy showed circumferential irregular, friable, edematous mucosa in rectum extending for 15 cm. Computed tomography showed a large heterogeneously enhancing polypoid mass lesion in the rectal wall involving the entire rectum. The patient underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection with colo-anal anastomosis and protecting loop ileostomy. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed villous adenoma of the rectum with moderate to severe dysplasia."
