  "text": "A 63-year old obese female was admitted due to intestinal obstruction. She has undergone the laparoscopic cholecystectomy 1 year ago. On examination, abdomen was bloated and roughly 10 cm size mass was palpable on the right subcostal area. Plane radiogram of the abdomen showed signs of intestinal obstruction. Since conservative treatment was ineffective, the patient was operated on. The laparotomy revealed a protrusion of a part of right large intestine and greater omentum into the subcutaneous space through the abdominal wall defect below right subcostal margin. There was a dilatation of intestines proximally incarcerated colon. It was released and a part of omentum was resected. The peritoneum and fascia-muscular defect was closed by interrupted vicryl sutures."
