  "text": "This report describes the case of an 87-year-old woman who had severe bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, gait disturbance and neck pain. Laboratory examination revealed marked elevations of white blood cells (10,100/Âµl) and C-reactive protein (CRP; 8.63 mg/dl). She was primarily diagnosed with severe and untreated PD, corresponding to Hoehn and Yahr scale score IV, with musculoskeletal pain and urinary tract infection. The patient was treated with antiparkinsonism drugs, antibiotic agents and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but they had only limited effects. Cervical plain computed tomography (CT) scanning detected remarkable crown-like calcification surrounding the odontoid process. Based on CT findings, the patient was diagnosed as having CDS with PD, and was immediately treated with corticosteroid. The severe neck rigidity with pain and the serum CRP level (0.83 mg/dl) of the patient were drastically improved within a week by the additional corticosteroid therapy."
