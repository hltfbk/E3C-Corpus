  "text": "We report a case of a patient presenting with papillitis, myositis and sensory peripheral neuropathy 18 months before a diagnosis of metastatic oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer was confirmed. The patient was treated with anastrozole which led not only to a decrease of her tumour burden but also to an improvement in her biochemical markers and amelioration of her clinical symptoms."
