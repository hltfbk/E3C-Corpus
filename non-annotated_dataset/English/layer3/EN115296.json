  "text": "The intraoral examination of a 17-year-old Turkish female with severe plasminogen deficiency revealed generalized increased pocket probing depths ranging from 6 to 9 mm, bleeding on probing over 30%, generalized tooth mobility, and gingival hyperplasia. Alveolar bone loss ranged from 30% to 50%. Clinical attachment loss corresponded to pocket probing depths. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Eikenella corrodens have been detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction. Periodontal treatment consisted of full mouth disinfection and adjunctive systemic administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tid) and metronidazole (400 mg tid). A strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen every three month in terms of supra- and subgingival debridement was rendered. The reported therapy has significantly improved periodontal health and arrested disease progression. Intraoral examination at the end of the observation period 3.5 years after non-surgical periodontal therapy showed generalized decreased pocket probing depths ranging from 1 to 6 mm, bleeding on probing lower 30%, and tooth mobility class I and II. Furthermore, microbiological analysis shows the absence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Treponema denticola after therapy."
