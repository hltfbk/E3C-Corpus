  "text": "A man complained of early satiety for 2 mouths, whose upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy showed a tumor arising from the greater curvature of gastric body and extending into the lumen. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed coexistence of gastric, intro-abdominal and retroperitoneal masses. Wedge resection for gastric tumor, resection for intro-abdominal and retroperitoneal tumors were done. The postoperative histological examination suggested simultaneous development of a gastric GIST, intro-abdominal and retroperitoneal myxoid liposarcomas."
