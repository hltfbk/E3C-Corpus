  "text": "A 40-year-old woman was found to have thickening of the gallbladder wall during a routine medical examination and was referred to our hospital, where she was found to have granular shadows in the lungs; mediastinal, cervical, intraperitoneal, and inguinal lymphadenopathy; parotid gland enlargement; and an erythematous skin rash. She was diagnosed as having systemic sarcoidosis by transbronchial lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage. All her systemic mass lesions except for the one in the gallbladder resolved or became smaller with steroid treatment. The steroid-resistant gallbladder lesion showed enhancement on contrast-enhanced computed tomography and was shown by endoscopic ultrasonography to be a 30-mm-diameter gallbladder wall lesion. We performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which resulted in diagnosis of the steroid-resistant tumor as a schwannoma. Five months after surgery, the patient's prednisolone dosage had been gradually reduced to 5 mg/day and she was doing well with no evidence of recurrence."
