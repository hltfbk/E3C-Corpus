  "text": "A 32 year old woman with neurogenic bladder managed with intermittent self catheterisations, presented with gross hematuria. On cystoscopy, she had a bulky bladder mass on the posterior bladder wall. Bladder biopsies revealed sarcomatoid variant of bladder transitional cell carcinoma. Treatment included radical cystectomy with ileal conduit diversion and adjuvant chemotherapy with excellent intermediate term follow up."
