  "text": "An 81-year-old man presented with worsening epigastric pain. He had been diagnosed with multiple HCC with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and underwent TACE 19 days previously. A contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed rupture of an HCC. He was treated nonoperatively and discharged on hospital day 18. Five weeks after TACE, he was emergently admitted with massive hematochezia and shock. A contrast enhanced CT scan demonstrated extrinsic gastric compression by an HCC lesion with extravasation of contrast into the stomach. Emergent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a bleeding gastric ulcer with extraluminal compression which was successfully controlled by hypertonic saline-epinephrine injection. Due to tumor progression, he was discharged for palliative care and died six weeks after TACE."
