  "text": "We present an unusual case of a 32-year-old male worker who sustained a \"shot\" to the left upper abdominal quadrant, as a result of a work-related accident. The projectile derived from a special wire that tore during operation. One chain element happened to accelerate towards the patients belly and perforated the abdominal wall. Computer tomography located the radiopaque projectile to the cortex of the left kidney and showed a lesion of the tail of the pancreas. The presence of intraperitoneal free air suggested a gastrointestinal perforation. Immediate open exploration of the peritoneal cavity and the retroperitoneal space revealed perforating lesions of the anterior and posterior gastric wall, as well as the pancreatic tail. The projectile was finally retrieved in the upper pole of the left kidney. The patient had a good clinical course subsequent to surgery and was discharged in good general condition."
