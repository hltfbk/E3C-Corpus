  "text": "A 63-year-old Asian woman presented to our hospital with complaint of pain and brownish discharge from her left eye for 3 d. Imaging studies revealed intratumoral calcification within the left eye with eyeball rupture. Enucleation of the left eye was performed and pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of CM. Systemic surveillance revealed no metastatic diseases. However, the patient was lost to follow-up 3 mo after surgery. At 1.5 years after the operation, she presented to our emergency department with complaint of dull epigastric pain that radiated to the back for 1 d. Imaging studies revealed a large mass at the upper abdomen abutting the pancreatic neck and body as well as several nodular lesions in the liver. Fine needle biopsy was performed and findings confirmed liver and pancreatic metastases."
