  "text": "A 76-year-old female patient was preoperatively diagnosed with a papillary adenocarcinoma in Vater's papilla by endoscopic biopsy. The patient underwent subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy, and postoperative pathological examination diagnosed the carcinosarcoma. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine, but multiple liver metastases were found 3 months after the operation. Though chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin was introduced, she died owing to tumor progression 7 months after the operation."
