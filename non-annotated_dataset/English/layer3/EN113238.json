  "text": "We report about a 34-year-old Crohn's Disease (CD) patient in clinical remission under adalimumab therapy who presented in the clinic for Cranio-Maxillo Surgery due to severe pain in the mandibular area. Ulcerative lesions of the buccal-side mucosa of the right mandible were detected. To rule out malignancy, a biopsy was obtained and revealed ulcerative stomatitis with noncaseating granulomas consistent with oral CD. Shortening the adalimumab administration interval to weekly injections resulted in a complete healing of the oral CD lesions without residual inflammation."
