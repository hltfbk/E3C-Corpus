  "text": "A 47-year-old man with nonspecific abdominal complains was found to have an ill-defined mass on his mesenteric root. Laparoscopic biopsy and stepwise histopathological examination revealed a mesenteric plasmacytoma, and extensive imaging and laboratory investigations led to the diagnosis of the solitary mesenteric plasmacytoma. The patient underwent definitive radiotherapy and remains under remission one year later."
