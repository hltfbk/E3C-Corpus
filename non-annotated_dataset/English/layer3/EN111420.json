  "text": "A 27-year-old Chinese man developed anorexia, vomiting, and limb weakness and was diagnosed with pituitary insufficiency. He had low serum sodium, slow movement, muscle weakness, and muscle tone abnormalities after sodium supplementation, involuntary limb shaking, ataxia, and dysarthria. According to the symptoms and signs and imaging reports, he was diagnosed with extramedullary myelinolysis. After treatment with hormone therapy and neurotrophic drugs, motor and speech function did not improve, so he was treated in the rehabilitation department for 4 wk. The patient's physical status was improved substantially during his stay at the rehabilitation department."
