  "text": "We report two cases of penile self-mutilation precipitated by erotic and religious bizarre delusions.Our first patient is a 24-year-old Moroccan man who visited our emergency room with a metallic ring at the root of his penis which had caused marked edema of his entire penis.Our second patient is a 26-year-old Moroccan man evaluated in our emergency unit. A clinical examination revealed a wound at the dorsal side of his penis with complete transection of the dorsal vein and imperfect hemostasis.The two patients were treated in our emergency unit after which a favorable clinical course was observed."
