  "text": "We present as our main case a 20-year-old Japanese woman with anorexia nervosa who engaged in \"tube vomiting.\" Although she recovered well under medical treatment in our hospital, she began to lose weight and blood potassium soon after discharge. We found that she used a garden hose instead of her fingers to perform self-induced vomiting,. She inserted the hose into her stomach and evacuated the stomach contents through it, without pain. She learned this technique through a blog about eating disorders. We also present two other similar cases. In fact, many patients discuss \"tube vomiting\" on the internet."
