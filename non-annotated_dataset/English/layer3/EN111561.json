  "text": "We report a case of a 10-year-old Pakistani boy brought by his parents to our institution. He had clinical and radiological features of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive and presented with multiple painful lumps on his back due to hard masses and stiffness of his shoulders, neck, and left hip. He underwent surgical excision of left hip ossification followed by an exaggerated response in ossification with early disability. Radiological examination revealed widespread heterotopic ossification. All of his laboratory blood test results were normal."
