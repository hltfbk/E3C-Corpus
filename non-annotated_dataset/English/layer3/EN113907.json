  "text": "A 14-year-old Han Chinese woman with a history of chronic renal failure caused by neurogenic bladder. On admission, she was unconscious and her pupils presented different sizes, while her vital signs were normal. MRI showed high signal in the dorsal pontine base and in the mid brain on fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) imaging and on T2-weighted imaging while the signal was normal on diffusion-weighted images (DWI). Blood analysis revealed renal failure and acidosis. After urinary retention treatment and acidosis correction, the patient soon recovered. Follow-up MRI 2Â months after the discharge revealed complete resolution of UE in the brainstem."
