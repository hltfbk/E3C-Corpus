  "text": "A 39 year old female presented with an acute both bone forearm fracture in the setting of a Volkmann's contracture. Although very limited in use, the arm was functional for holding objects and was determined to be important in her activities of daily living. The surgical management involved open reduction internal fixation with radial and ulnar shortening osteotomies to restore cortical alignment secondary to the extensive overlying soft tissue contractures."
