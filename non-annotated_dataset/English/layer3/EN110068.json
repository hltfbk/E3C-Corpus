  "text": "A thirty two year old right hand dominated male patient presented with complaints of swelling, pain on movements, limited movements, and loss of grip strength of right wrist of four week`s duration. The patient had a road traffic accident four weeks back leading to high velocity injury and fall on the outstretched hand with wrist in dorsiflexion and radial deviation. The patient consulted a local practioner who treated him in a plaster of Paris slab for two weeks. The slab was removed after two weeks, the patient noticed a decrease in the swelling but continued to have pain, limited movements and loss of grip strength for which he was referred to our hospital which is the Apex centre of the country. The consulted four weeks after the injury for which x rays were done. The x-rays, done four weeks after the injury, were suggestive of fracture scaphoid and dislocation of the proximal row of carpals. C.T. scan was done after reviewing the X-rays which confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was advised proximal row carpectomy or wrist arthodesis if reduction of carpals failed since the injury was old. The patient was taken for surgery under guarded prognosis with consent for wrist arthrodesis if open reduction fails. Volar and dorsal approaches were used to open the wrist joint. The proximal pole of scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum and pisiform were found to be dislocated as a unit. Decompression of the carpal tunnel was done and reduction of the proximal row was attempted but failed. Dislocated proximal row was excised and wrist arthodesis was performed with the wrist in neutral position. The excised carpal bones were crushed and used as bone graft. The patient was mobilised two weeks after the surgery and was followed for one year. The follow-up x-rays showed sound union. The patient showed fair result with grip strength of 85% to contralateral side and modified Mayo wrist score [14] of 65 at one year."
