  "text": "A 9-year-old Korean girl presented with typical clinical features of FPS. She had generalized loose skin with decreased subcutaneous fat, skin wrinkling on the forehead and limbs, skull deformities and a peculiar facial appearance with microphthalmia and midface hypoplasia, anomalies of the digits and nails, a large umbilical hernia and a nearly normal developmental outcome. She exhibited prenatal and postnatal growth retardation together with short stature, and records showed that her height and weight were invariably under - 2.0 SD from birth to the age of 10 years. SLC25A24 analysis revealed a heterozygous mutation reported previously, NM_013386:c.650G > A, p.[Arg217His]. After screening her family for the identified mutation, she was confirmed as being a de novo case of FPS caused by an SLC25A24 mutation."
