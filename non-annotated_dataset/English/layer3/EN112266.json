  "text": "A 4-year-old Black African boy from the Menchum Division in the Northwest Region of Cameroon, with no history of deworming since birth, presented with a 3-day history of generalized abdominal pains, vomiting and obstipation, and abdominal distention evolving over a period of 6 months. Clinical and paraclinical findings were in favor of a subacute intestinal occlusion associated with an electrolyte imbalance. An exploratory laparotomy was done after correction of the electrolyte imbalance. Perioperative findings revealed a dilated small bowel obstructed by bundles of live worms. An enterotomy of 2 cm in length was done, and the bundles of Ascaris lumbricoides worms extracted manually and by milking through the stoma. His postoperative period was unremarkable, and he was discharged on postoperative day 7. He and his entire household were dewormed with a single dose of mebendazole 500 mg administered orally. A follow-up visit 1 week after discharge revealed a healed abdominal wound and normal bowel functions."
