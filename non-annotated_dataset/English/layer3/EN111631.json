  "text": "A healthy middle-aged male presented with an episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure and reduced level of consciousness preceded by consumption of excess water. He was recently diagnosed to have a ureteric calculus and was advised to consume plenty of water. On examination, he was disoriented in place, person and time. Except for the generalized diminished reflexes, other neurological and systemic examinations were normal. He had severe hyponatraemia, mild hypokalaemia and myoglobulinuria. His serum creatinine phosphokinase and aspartate aminotransferase were markedly elevated. The diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis in the setting of acute water intoxication was made. Optimum fluid and electrolyte management achieved a dramatic recovery of consciousness, hyponatraemia and rhabdomyolysis."
