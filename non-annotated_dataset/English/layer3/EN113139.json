  "text": "An 81-year-old man was diagnosed with type 3 remnant gastric cancer with giant para-aortic lymph node metastasis, and he received SOX chemotherapy. After three courses of SOX chemotherapy, the primary tumor and para-aortic lymph node metastases markedly reduced in size, indicating a partial response. Because conversion surgery was possible, the patient underwent total remnant gastrectomy with D2 and para-aortic lymph node dissection. Histological examination revealed no residual cancer cells in the resected stomach and lymph nodes. The patient was diagnosed with a complete pathological response and was discharged on postoperative day 24. Currently, 1Â year after surgery, the patient is alive and has not shown any tumor recurrence."
