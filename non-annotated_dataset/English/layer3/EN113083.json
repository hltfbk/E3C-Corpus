  "text": "A 25-year-old male patient reported to us after 22 months after he had undergone curettage and bone grafting for GCT of lateral femoral condyle of his right knee with recurrence of primary tumor. After tumor resection, we restored the lost articular surface with musculovascular pedicled patella and managed dead space with corticocancellous bone graft and fibular strut. 2-year follow-up exhibited good functional outcome without any sign of recurrence."
