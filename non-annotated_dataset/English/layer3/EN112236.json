  "text": "A 31-year-old Caucasian man with a history of pineal blastoma at the age of 3 years, which was treated with resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, presented to our institution with right M1 stroke. Further assessment by computed tomographic perfusion study with acetazolamide demonstrated steal phenomenon of the right middle cerebral artery territory (type III response) with a small internal region of matched cerebral blood volume defect (that is, infarct core). Coincidentally, he was found to have multiple brain masses consistent with meningiomas. Occlusive radiation vasculopathy was the most likely culprit of the patient's stroke. The patient was treated medically with \"baby\" acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel for 3â€‰months, then continued only on baby acetylsalicylic acid."
