  "text": "We present the case of a 31-year-old pregnant Indian woman with a three-month history of painful swelling within the tip of her right middle finger following a superficial laceration. She was otherwise well and had normal serum calcium and phosphate levels. Plain radiography demonstrated a dense, lobulated cluster of calcified nodules within the soft tissues of the volar pulp space, consistent with a diagnosis of tumoral calcinosis. This diagnosis was confirmed on the basis of the histopathological examination following surgical excision."
