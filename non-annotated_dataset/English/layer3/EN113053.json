  "text": "We present a 59-year-old man who came to the emergency department due to varicella and diarrhea. During initial evaluation acute kidney failure (AKF) was diagnosed, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Continuous renal replacement therapy was applied, and the patient was treated with acyclovir in adjusted doses; renal biopsy revealed acute tubular necrosis. Complete renal function recovery was established after 12 days."
