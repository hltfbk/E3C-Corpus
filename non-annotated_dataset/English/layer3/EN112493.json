  "text": "We reported a 78-year-old woman presenting with severe hypocalcemia. Investigations confirmed vitamin D and iron deficiency as well as hypoalbuminemia. Celiac disease was suspected and confirmed, but despite intravenous calcium and magnesium supplementation and a gluten-free diet, normal electrolyte levels were never reached. Intestinal perforation was the clue to the diagnosis of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL)."
