  "text": "A 78-year-old-woman presented with melena. Abdominal computed tomography images and endoscopic examination revealed a submucosal jejunal mass with tumor thrombus extending into a jejunal vein. The patient underwent a curative resection combined with a partial jejunectomy and partial pancreatectomy. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue showed tumor cells with a homogeneous acinar architecture identical to pancreatic-type ACC and tumor thrombus. Postoperatively, she was followed for 10Â months and had no recurrence."
