  "text": "Here, we present a 62-year-old Caucasian female who developed an osteosarcoma in a fibrous dysplasia lesion of the proximal femur in the background of Mazabraud's Syndrome. The patient was treated with wide excision and endoprosthetic reconstruction. She declined adjuvant chemotherapy. She is alive without evidence of disease one-year postoperatively."
