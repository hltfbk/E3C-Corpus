  "text": "A 52-year-old man presented with heart failure. The diagnosis of NCCM was confirmed after echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance tomography. Interestingly, the angiogram revealed a coronary anomaly, in which the circumflex artery rose aberrantly from the right coronary artery. Due to left ventricular ejection fraction being less than 35% despite optimal pharmacological therapy, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted and four years later a ventricular tachycardia was terminated by antitachycardia pacing."
