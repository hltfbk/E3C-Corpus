  "text": "The authors report a case of selenium-responsive cardiomyopathy in a 15-month old Saudi Arabian boy. This case of selenium deficiency causing dilated cardiomyopathy is presented with failure to thrive, prolonged fever and respiratory distress. The investigations revealed selenium deficiency. Selenium supplementation along with anti-failure therapy [Furosimide, Captopril] was administered for 6 months. Following therapy the cardiac function, hair, skin and the general health of the patient improved significantly."
