  "text": "We present the case of a 40-year-old patient with pain in the right lower limb resulting from acute thrombophlebitis. No risk factors could be identified. His history was remarkable with two episodes of deep venous thrombosis first of the left, then the right leg 22 years earlier; at that time also, no risk factor was identified. Because of the idiopathic character of that thrombosis, the patient remained on long-term anticoagulation with phenprocoumon. The present thrombophlebitis occurred while the INR was not therapeutic in the preceding weeks. A CT with contrast showed atresia of the inferior vena cava and of the right kidney, and presence of numerous collaterals. A thorough medical history revealed a renal vein thrombosis as a neonate. Anticoagulation was intensified, and stent placement became necessary after a further 2 years."
