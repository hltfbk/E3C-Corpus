  "text": "A 4-year-old girl presented with a left elbow swelling after falling from a height of 2 meters. X-rays showed a fracture of the proximal ulna with lateral dislocation of the radial head (type III Monteggia) associated with an ipsilateral fracture of the lateral condyle of the humerus. The fractures were treated by closed reduction of the radial head dislocation, percutaneous Kirschner wire fixation of the proximal ulna fracture, and open reduction and Kirschner wire fixation of the lateral condyle."
