Skin examination showed erythematous annular lesion of each cheek, measuring 3 cm in diameter, with well-demarcated keratotic and filiform border. The rest of the tegument was normal and physical examination was otherwise normal. Histological examination of a cutaneous biopsy showed dermal non-caseating sarcoidal granulomas with few lymphoid cells around epithelioid cells. The Ziehl-Neelsen and PAS staining techniques were negative. No cornoid lamella was noted. Serum Angiotensin Converting Enzyme rate was slight increased and tuberculin skin test (PPD test) was negative. Liver function, kidney function, hemogram, serum and urinary calcium, electrocardiogram, hands and feet X-rays without abnormalities.Chest radiograph showed a fine reticular opacity of the lower third of lung parenchyma. Chest computed tomography demonstrated bilateral hilar and pretracheal adenopathies associated with fine reticular bands in the lower lobes basal segments. Spyrometry revealed light restrictive disorder and the ophthalmologic examination was normal. Treatment with prednisone 0,5mg/kg/day associated with hydroxychloroquine 400mg/day was initiated with partial remission after 3 mounths."
