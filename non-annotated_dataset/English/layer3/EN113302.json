  "text": "We report the case of a child that presented chronic constipation, encopresis and mycrocephaly. The characteristics were initially compatible with a case of functional constipation and a therapy with polyethylene glycol was prescribed. After a year, because of poor response, a plain abdominal X-ray was performed, detecting sacrum abnormalities. Finally, a CGH-array analysis was performed and a form of Currarino Syndrome caused by a rare 7q36 microdeletion, was diagnosed."
