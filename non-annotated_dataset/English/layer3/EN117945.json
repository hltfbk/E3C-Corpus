  "text": "We present the case of a 75-year-old Chinese man with prostate cancer and pernicious anemia. His serum vitamin B(12 )level was 32 pg/ml (300-900 pg/ml) and holotranscobalamin was 0 pg/ml (>70 pg/ml). There was an unexpected rapid progression of Gleason's score during 10 months of watchful waiting. After the diagnosis of pernicious anemia was made, therapeutic injections of vitamin B(12 )were started. We observed a significant acceleration in prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase and a shortening of prostate-specific antigen doubling time after initiation of B(12 )therapy."
