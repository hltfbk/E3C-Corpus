  "text": "Patient 1 was a 2-year-old female with severe aplastic anemia. A typical lung lesion in the computed tomography of the chest with elevated GM levels was noted, and probable IA was diagnosed. After a combination treatment of voriconazole and caspofungin, the GM levels decreased. Although of significant improvement, the pulmonary lesion in the chest X-ray did not disappear before HSCT. The GM levels increased when she received the conditioning regimen during HSCT. The GM levels remained high during the use of steroids for the graft-versus-host disease and declined gradually after tapering off steroids and cyclosporine. Patient 2 was a 12-year-old female with severe aplastic anemia. Voriconazole was administered after the diagnosis of a probable IA. The pulmonary lesions in the chest X-ray disappeared before HSCT. The GM levels flared up during the administration of conditioning regimen and declined after neutrophil engraftment. At present, the two patients were cured of the disease without requiring surgical resection of their pulmonary IA."
