  "text": "A 60-year-old man with a history of plasma cell myeloma with IGH-MAF gene rearrangement and RAS/RAF mutations developed multiple soft tissue lesions one year following melphalan-based chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Morphological and immunohistochemical characterization of the extramedullary disease demonstrated that the tumor cells were derived from the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Next generation sequencing (NGS) studies detected similar clonal aberrations in the diagnostic plasma cell population and post-therapy neoplastic cells, including IGH-MAF rearrangement, multiple genetic mutations in RAS signaling pathway proteins, and loss of tumor suppressor genes. Molecular genetic analysis also revealed unique genomic alterations in the transformed tumor cells, including gain of NF1 and loss of TRAF3."
