  "text": "A 48-year-old healthy man with no history of trauma presented with pains and swelling of the posterior aspect of the left ankle and lower calf. The local examination revealed mass about 2 inches above the left ankle. A plain radiograph revealed a bony mass at the left TA region. The magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of a bony mass within the substance of TA. All the clinical and biochemical laboratory tests were within normal limits. The heterotopic bone mass was removed, using a posterior longitudinal incision over the left TA, centering over the bony mass. At 6 months of follow-up, the patient had no pain, swelling, and a full range of ankle movements."
