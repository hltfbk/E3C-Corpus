  "text": "A Caucasian man with neurofibromatosis type 1 presented at our clinic complaining of a slow growing swelling on his left forearm over a period of one and a half years. Clinical examination and history pointed to malignancy. Radiological examination inclusive of magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography confirmed our suspicion. A final diagnosis of dedifferentiated high-grade liposarcoma with axillary lymph node metastases was established after a pathological examination of a tumour biopsy. The consulting tumour board recommended either an elbow exarticulation or an accurate radical local resection including the metastatic axillary lymph nodes. Fortunately, we were able to perform an R-zero resection and the forearm could be saved. The treatment was completed with postoperative radiotherapy of the left forearm's operative bed, the left axillary and the supraclavicular regions. The patient decided against adjuvant chemotherapy."
