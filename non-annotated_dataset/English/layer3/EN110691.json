  "text": "The proband was a 9-month-old twin (T2) girl with a healthy twin sister (T1) of Sri Lankan origin born to non-consanguineous parents. She presented with right sided continuous icthyosiform erythroderma and ipsilateral limb defects and congenital hemidysplasia since birth. Notably the child had ipsilateral hand hypoplasia and syndactyly. There were other visceral abnormalities. We performed whole exome sequencing and found a novel heterozygous variant (NSDHL, c.713C > A, p.Thr238Asn)."
