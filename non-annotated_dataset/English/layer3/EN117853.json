  "text": "The authors describe the clinical course, diagnosis, therapeutic approach and prognosis of an infant with an orbital cavernous hemangioma accompanying intracranial lesions. A female infant 18 months of age, presented with a mass in the left upper eyelid, causing blepharoptosis. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and angiography of the brain and the orbits showed a hemangioma of the left upper eyelid and intracranial lesions to the left temporal fossa and the pons. At the age of 2 years and 8 months she was admitted again due to severe eyelid swelling, intense strong pain, exophthalmos and collateral ophthalmoplegia. Two operations were performed to remove the orbit mass. Histological examination, showed characteristics of cavernous hemangioma."
