  "text": "We describe the case of a 42-year-old female who presented with recurrent abdominal pain. She was found to have a smooth fragment of a reddish brown tissue attached to the anterior surface of the gallbladder during an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The tissue was removed with the gallbladder, and histopathology showed normal ectopic liver tissue."
