  "text": "A 74-year-old male with stage I RCC underwent right nephrectomy in 2004 and right lung metastasis resection in 2009. He was well till March 2016, when he presented with chest pain. Cardiac catheterization revealed a highly vascular mass in the apex. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left ventricular mass with full-thickness involvement of the myocardium, and the open cardiac biopsy was consistent with metastatic RCC. The patient was initially treated with pazopanib with response but later developed therapy-related side effects, and the dose was reduced. Due to tumor progression, he is currently on nivolumab instead and is stable."
