  "text": "An 81-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for investigation of the frequent elevation of hepatic and biliary enzymes and dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Preoperative examinations revealed an exposed reddish tumor in the ampulla of Vater, which was diagnosed on biopsy to be adenocarcinoma with squamous cell carcinoma component. Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy with regional lymph node dissection was performed. Pathological examinations revealed the presence of two malignant components in the lesion, including poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, without invasion beyond the sphincter of Oddi or into the duodenal submucosa. These squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma components in the tumor comprised approximately 30 and 70% of the lesion, respectively. No metastasis into regional lymph nodes was observed, and the patient experienced no tumor recurrence or metastasis until 20 months after surgery."
