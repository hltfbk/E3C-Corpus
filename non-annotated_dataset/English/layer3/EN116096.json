  "text": "Here we describe the case of a 40-year-old African American male-to-female transgender patient who presented to our institution with hypercalcemia and acute renal failure secondary to body contouring injections with industrial strength silicone by non-licensed providers, a decade prior to her visit. Work-up revealed an extensive granulomatous inflammatory process in the injection area resulting in electrolyte abnormalities and kidney injury. The patient's lab results and symptoms responded well to long-term corticosteroid treatment and correlated with treatment adherence."
