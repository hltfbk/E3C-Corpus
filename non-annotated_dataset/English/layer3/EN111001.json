  "text": "A 16-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was admitted to our hospital after an echocardiographic examination revealed a ring-like structure in the right atrium that was still present after 6 months' anticoagulation treatment with aspirin. The boy had had a PICC inserted 2 years previously for chemotherapy; the PICC was intact and successfully removed 18 months after insertion when chemotherapy is finished. Subsequent computer tomography and radiography differentiated right atrial ring-shaped mass with a diameter of approximately 15 mm. Cardiac surgery was performed to remove the mass which was found to be a calcified thrombus."
