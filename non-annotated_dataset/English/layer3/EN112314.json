  "text": "Here, we present a case of a 90-year-old male who was prescribed sorafenib after being diagnosed with hepatocellular cancer. At 1â€‰week after sorafenib initiation, he was admitted to the emergency room for an evaluation of weakness. The patient had hyponatremia, a common electrolyte abnormality seen in cancer patients. His hyponatremia improved when the sorafenib was stopped, suggesting that this was a rare case of hyponatremia induced by sorafenib."
