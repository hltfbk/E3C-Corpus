  "text": "We present the case of a 64-year-old woman with chest tightness, cough, and chest pain. Computed tomography showed multiple unresectable pulmonary nodules. She had been misdiagnosed with lung carcinoma and underwent gefitinib treatment at a hospital. Subsequently, the patient underwent a cardiothoracic surgery for further disease investigation. CD31, CD34, and Vimentin expression were detected in the resected nodule specimens by immunohistochemical analyses, and pathological analyses confirmed the diagnosis of P-EHE. Following this, four cycles of apatinib combined with chemotherapy with doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide were initiated. The patient demonstrated stabilization of multiple bilateral nodules and showed a dramatic improvement in the clinical presentation after combination treatment. The patient could not tolerate the side effects of chemotherapy. Therefore, she then continued apatinib monotherapy, which is ongoing to date. The patient was stable at the last follow-up after 24 mo."
