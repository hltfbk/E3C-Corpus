  "text": "This article reports a 17-year-old male involved in a road traffic accident, sustaining inferior hip dislocation. Following resuscitation, computed tomography confirmed the clinical diagnoses. Several attempts to perform a closed reduction of the hip under sedation and general anesthesia failed to reduce the dislocation. The patient underwent open reduction of his hip and capsule repair. Postoperatively no traction was applied, and the patient advised non-weight bearing on that side for 3 months."
