  "text": "Herein, we report the case of a 67-year-old woman diagnosed with PL in the anterior mediastinum. The tumor was removed by thoracoscopic surgery. There was no recurrence during the 24-mo follow-up period, and the prognosis was good. Most PL are located on the skin surface. However, they may also occur within the body, even in the mediastinum."
