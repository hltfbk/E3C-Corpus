  "text": "We describe a case of a 43-year-old Caucasian female post AMI diagnosed with a mid-cavitary mass within the LV. Although echocardiography and cardiovascular MRI (CMR) suggested that the mass was a thrombus, given the context of the recent AMI, exploration and surgical excision was completed by the surgeon due to the potential for the mass to embolize."
