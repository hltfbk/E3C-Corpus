  "text": "A 35-year-old, previously healthy Sri Lankan man, presented with fever for 3â€‰days with gum bleeding and progressive drowsiness. His Glasgow coma scale score was 10/15. He did not have papilloedema or neck stiffness. Laboratory evaluation showed a severe thrombocytopenia with microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. There was marginal renal impairment and normal coagulation profile. Non-contrast CT scan of brain was normal. A diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was made. Despite daily plasma exchanges and high-dose steroids, he failed to achieve the expected therapeutic response, thus demonstrating refractory TTP. On exploring for possible causes of refractoriness to treatment, a clinically significant PCR titre of CMV was detected. Treatment of CMV infection lead to complete recovery of TTP. His disease course was further complicated with spontaneous spinal haemorrhage leading to neurological sequelae."
