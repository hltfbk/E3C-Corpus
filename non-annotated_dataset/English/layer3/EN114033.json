  "text": "We report a case of a 35 year old Human Immunodeficiency Virus positive Kenyan male of Kikuyu ethnicity from Kiambu County who presented to hospital with a 6 day history of bilateral knee pain and swelling, bilateral ankle pain with right ankle swelling. The patient reported 6 months history of cough and weight loss. Chest radiograph had features consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis and sputum smear was positive for acid fast bacilli. Analysis of fluid from knee effusion showed no evidence of tuberculosis. Resolution of joint swelling was seen after 3 weeks of tuberculosis chemotherapy suggesting that this was reactive arthritis following pulmonary tuberculosis in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus."
