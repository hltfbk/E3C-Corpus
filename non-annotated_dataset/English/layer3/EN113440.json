  "text": "Here we report a 65-year old woman patient who presented with leukocytosis without sign of fever and tumors. Bone marrow aspirates showed a markedly hypercellular feature with 76%-92% myeloid and the dysplastic changes were found in about 7% of neutrophils cells. The bone marrow biopsy demonstrated marrow fibrosis with Gomori staining positive (+++~++++). Cytogenetic analysis showed 46,X,del (X) (q22). No molecular markers of BCR/ABL1 rearrangement (P210, P230, P190 and variably), JAK2V617F, FIP1L1-PDGFRA, TEL-PDGFRB, ZNF198-FGFR1 and SETBP1 mutations were identified, however, the CSF3R gene membrane proximal mutation (c.1853C > T/p.T618I sites) was detected by PCR techniques. The patient was diagnosed with CNL and died in about 2 months after disease diagnosis."
