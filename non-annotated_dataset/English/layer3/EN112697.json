  "text": "A 58-year-old Japanese woman (patient 1; height, 157 cm; weight, 74.5 kg) and a 73-year-old Japanese woman (patient 2; height, 153 cm; weight, 48 kg) were still doing classical ballet and hula dance, respectively, after primary total hip arthroplasty. For ballet, there were gradual three-dimensional hip movements with 48° flexion, 36° abduction, and 49° external rotation in développé and 34° flexion, 29° abduction, and 43° external rotation in plié. For hula, there were small three-dimensional hip movements with 31° flexion, 15° adduction, and 11° external rotation in kao and 17° flexion, 11° adduction, and 11° external rotation in kaholo. No liner-to-neck contact was found in any dance activities."
