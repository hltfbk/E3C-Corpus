  "text": "A 52-year-old woman with obstructive jaundice was referred to our clinic. She had a medical history of cholecystectomy and T-tube drainage for choledocholithiasis a year previously. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a mass located into the stomach which was compatible with gastric carcinoma. On the gastroscopy, a surgical gas compress that had totally migrated into the stomach was observed. The compress was successfully removed by gastroscopy through the esophagus. The recovery of the patient was uneventful."
