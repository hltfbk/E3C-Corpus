  "text": "A 25-year-old Indian man presented with a large abdominal mass. A computed tomography scan revealed a large 18Â cm-sized mass in his transverse colon, suggestive of gastrointestinal stromal tumor. A wide local excision was performed. Histopathology showed sheets and fascicles of elongated to spindle-shaped tumor cells showing a moderate degree of pleomorphism and atypia. Based on morphology and immunohistochemistry, a final diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor of the transverse colon was given. A peritoneal metastatic tumor deposit was identified grossly and confirmed on histopathology."
