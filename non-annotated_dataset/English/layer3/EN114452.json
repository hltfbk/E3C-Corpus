  "text": "Case 1: A 63-year-old postmenopausal Moroccan woman was diagnosed as having cervical squamous cell carcinoma. She was treated with radical concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy followed by low-dose brachytherapy. Six months after finishing the therapy, multiple skin nodules appeared on her abdomen and chest wall. An excision biopsy was performed and showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Her disease progressed and she died before completing her fourth course of palliative chemotherapy. Case 2: A 48-year-old Moroccan woman was diagnosed as having cervical squamous cell carcinoma; she was treated with concurrent chemoradiation. Before a planned high-dose brachytherapy, she noticed many nodular lesions on her arms, thighs, and chest wall. An excision biopsy was performed and showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. She then underwent a series of imaging examinations, including computed tomography of her chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a whole body bone scan that showed disseminated disease involving her lungs and bones. She died after two courses of palliative chemotherapy, 2Â months after the appearance of the skin lesions."
