  "text": "A 14-year old female caucasian patient, residing in the south of Germany, presented in the oncological outpatient clinic of our Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine in June 2014 complaining of increasing neck pain and progressive swelling at her left cheek ongoing for about 6 weeks. These symptoms had been occurring quarterly for 4 years, but had never been as pronounced. Blood biochemistry showed a moderately elevated CRP (35 mg/l) and a significantly increased blood sedimentation rate (BSR 48/120 mm). The panoramic radiograph, however, revealed a bone alteration in the left mandibular region. Further investigations confirmed the diagnosis of CRMO."
