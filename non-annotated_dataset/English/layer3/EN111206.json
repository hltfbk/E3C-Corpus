  "text": "Two young males with a history of chronic kidney disease who were being treated with long-term haemodialysis presented to our hospital with clinical signs of disruption of the extensor mechanism of the knee. One patient was diagnosed with bilateral quadriceps tendon rupture, and the other patient had bilateral patellar tendon rupture. They underwent surgical repair of the tendons, and their knees were actively mobilized during physiotherapy."
