  "text": "A 44-year-old woman experienced transient numbness of her right sided face and arm and was referred to our unit due to small brain lesions in magnetic resonance imaging, with a possible diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Neurological examination was unremarkable except for plantar reflexes and jerky deep tendon reflexes. Brain magnetic resonance angiography revealed findings typically seen in moyamoya disease, confirmed with digital subtraction angiography. Antiplatelet therapy started, but few days later, she developed suddenly global aphasia and right hemiparesis (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale/NIHSS 6). Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute infarct in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery. At her discharge, she was significantly improved (NIHSS 3)."
