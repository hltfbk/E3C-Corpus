  "text": "We report a 6-month-old male infant who had skin lesions of various morphologies (macules, papules, plaques, and nodules) and sizes, persistent blistering and frequent flushing episodes for half a year. Vital signs and physical examinations were unremarkable. No abnormalities in the laboratory tests were found except for a serum tryptase level (STL) of 11.8 ng/ml. The histological and immunohistochemical examinations confirmed the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis. The patient was first treated with methylprednisolone, oral levocetirizine, and topical fusidic acid/betamethasone cream. Subsequently the treatment was tapered and stopped within 9 weeks. The child's symptoms improved and were successfully controlled with intermittent courses of ketotifen and topical hydrocortisone over 3 years."
