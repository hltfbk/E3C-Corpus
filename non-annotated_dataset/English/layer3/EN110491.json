  "text": "A 76-year-old male, with a history of colon cancer treated in 2013 (surgery), admitted in the intensive care unit for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The patient has reported a stay in an endemic country 21 days before the admission. The main symptoms were dry cough, 40°C fever, multiples adenopathies and diarrhea. The patient's state worsened and complicated by respiratory distress leading to a transfer to intensive care unit. A PCR test was conducted and came back positive. Chest CT scan showed bilateral ground glass opacities with consolidation. During his admission, the patient was conscious, GCS at 15/15, polypneic at 30 cycles/min, SpO2 of 85% at breathing room air with intercostal retraction, stable hemodynamics: BP 140/75mmHg, HR at 90bpm and 39°C fever. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm, fixed duration of PR interval, QTc at 475. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. Arterial blood gas showed pH at 7.46, PaCO2 at 48mmHg, HCO3- at 26mmol/L, PaO2 at 131mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 257. Lab tests conducted at D1 of admission, revealed elevated WBC at 140020el/mm 3 and lymphocytes 129660el/mm 3 (vs 154000el/mm 3 at D7), low hemoglobin at 8.9g/dL, platelets at 464000el/mm 3, PT at 64%, fibrinogen at 6.77g/L, CRP at 130mg/L, BNP at 249pcg/L, PCT at 0.017μg/L, LDH at 331UI/L, ferritin at 563μg/L, troponin at 8.2ng/L. Blood smear showed small lymphocytes with rounded nucleus and reduced cytoplasm. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood confirmed the presence of B-cell population; expressing one light chain immunoglobulin. Our therapeutic care was based on four daily noninvasive ventilation (NIV) sessions, hydroxychloroquine (200mg, twice a day), azythromycin (500mg per day), ceftriaxon (2g per day) and moxifloxacin (400mg, twice a day). The patient also received preventive dose of human immunoglobulins (0.5g/kg single dose), anti-coagulation, PPI, vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc. The patient's respiratory status worsened leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. Severe ARDS followed and 10 days after his admission, the patient expired. Ethical approval: informed consent was obtained from the patient's family for publication of this case."
