  "text": "We report the clinical and cytogenetic characterization of a patient (male, 33 years-old, first child of healthy Portuguese non-consanguineous parents) presenting with a complex phenotype including SCD without intellectual deficiency and carrying a mosaic supernumerary ring chromosome 19p. Microarray-Based Comparative Genomic Hybridization and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization were performed. Genetic analysis showed a large mosaic interstitial duplication 19p13.12p12 of the short arm of chromosome 19, spanning 8.35 Mb. Our data suggested a putative association between psychosocial dysfunction and mosaic pure trisomy 19p13.2p12."
