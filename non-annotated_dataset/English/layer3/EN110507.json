  "text": "We present the case of an 80-year-old male who presented right elbow pain, which was disturbing his sleep and limiting his ability to perform his daily activities. In the anamnesis, 27 years ago the patient was diagnosed and treated for lung squamous cell carcinoma, receiving surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. As an initial part of the study, an elbow x-ray was requested, identifying a bone spur without appreciating any cortex lesion. Due to the persistence and lack of improvement of the symptoms, an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which showed a destructive lesion of the bone cortex of the elbow joint. Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed on the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis to identify the primary lesion and a thickening of the rectum was observed. Bone scintigraphy and positron emission tomography (PET) were performed to rule out distant dissemination of other metastatic lesions. No pulmonary or hepatic metastases were revealed and the only objectifiable metastatic lesion was the right elbow. In direct questioning, the patient reported no occasional bleeding in the rectum or alteration of the bowel movements. The colonoscopy showed a circumferential lesion 9 cm from the anal margin. Biopsy of the rectal lesion and elbow lesion confirmed a poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma of primary and metastatic origin, respectively. The staging of a T4N1M1 lesion was completed with a rectal MRI, which reported rectal lesion extended to perirectal fat with enlarged lymph nodes. Anterior resection of rectum after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy were made. The bone metastasis received palliative radiotherapy and was not resected. The patient died 10 months after diagnosis."
