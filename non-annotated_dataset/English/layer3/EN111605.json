  "text": "The patient was a 65-year-old woman. She complained of dizziness, numbness and weakness of the right hand for 6 mo. She was diagnosed with bilateral common carotid artery common trunk with aberrant right subclavian artery combined with right subclavian steal syndrome by ultrasound, enhanced computed tomography, computed tomography angiography and other examinations. Considering the surgical risks, the patient refused the aberrant right subclavian artery stent implantation and was discharged. We hypothesize that these two kinds of deformity and right subclavian steal syndrome may not occur by accident and result from multiple malformations."
