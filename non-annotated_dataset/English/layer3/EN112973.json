  "text": "We report two cases who presented with fever and blood routine abnormity which were conformed as SFTS eventually. They were performed bone marrow aspiration and were admitted to the department of hematology with a preliminary diagnosis of MM. They all had hyperimmunoglobulinemia, extensive bone marrow and peripheral blood plasma cells, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), elevated hepatic enzyme. The two patients recovered with treatment of doxycycline, human immunoglobulins, plasma transfusion, and other supporting treatments. But case 1 occurred lymphoma 8Â months later and died."
