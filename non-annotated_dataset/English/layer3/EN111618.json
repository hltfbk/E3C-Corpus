  "text": "Over the past 10â€‰years, three surgeries were performed on a 69-year-old women with a history of follicular thyroid cancer and its metastatic lesions. The patient presented with a 3-month history of masses in the left chest. She underwent detailed examination of the chest wall tumors, and surgery was then performed to resect all of the tumors. Based on the histopathology, these lymph nodes were confirmed to harbor metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma."
