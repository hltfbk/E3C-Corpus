  "text": "Case 1 was a 58-year-old man who underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection for cecum cancer with multiple metastases to the lungs in 2011. We performed treatment with mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab chemotherapy in August 2011. After 11 courses, computed tomography (CT) revealed a CR to chemotherapy in February 2012. He has remained disease-free for 5 years and 3 months. Case 2 was a 70-year-old woman who underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection for cecum cancer in August 2010. Recurrence of multiple metastases to both lungs was detected in November 2010. We started treatment with XELOX and bevacizumab chemotherapy in January 2011. In January 2011, CT after 14 courses revealed disappearance of the lung lesions, thereby indicating a CR. She has remained disease-free for 5 years and 4 months."
