  "text": "We report three cases of nodular sarcoidosis in young females of Asian origin who had initially presented with dry cough and worsening dyspnea non-responsive to initially administered antibiotics. Pulmonary nodules were discovered upon radiographic imaging in all three cases which raised concern for the possibility of neoplastic processes. Subsequent biopsies revealed granulomatous inflammation indicative of sarcoidosis. All cases responded very well to systemic corticosteroids."
