  "text": "The patient was a 10-year-old girl who presented with an abdominal mass that was discovered at palpation and noninvasive imaging examinations. Computed tomography (CT) showed a well-circumscribed heterogeneous mass extending from the stomach into the duodenum. The patient underwent a laparotomy to pull out the trichobezoar. Although these imaging findings are nonspecific, trichobezoar should be included in the differential diagnosis of gastric mass, especially with the history of an irresistible urge to pull out and swallow their hair."
