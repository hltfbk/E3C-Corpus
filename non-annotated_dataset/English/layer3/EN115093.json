  "text": "We report the clinical and cytogenetic characterization of a patient (male, newborn, first child of healthy non-consanguineous parents) died after three days of life with severe neonatal pulmonary hypertension, due to diffuse capillary hemangiomatosis diagnosed post mortem. Conventional karyotyping, Microarray-Based Comparative Genomic Hydridization (CGHa) and quantitative PCR were performed. CGHa revealed a heterozygous chromosome 16q23.3q24.1 interstitial deletion, spanning about 2.6 Mb and involving a FOXF1 gene enhancer. Quantitative PCR showed that the proband's deletion was de novo. Microsatellite analysis demonstrate that the deletion occurred in the maternal chromosome 16."
