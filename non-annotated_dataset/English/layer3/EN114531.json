  "text": "A 41-year-old man with no prior comorbidities presenting with dyspnoea, fever, and oedema was admitted to the cardiac emergency service. He had fever and dry cough, which aggravated into progressive respiratory distress, lower limb oedema, and orthopnoea 30 days prior to hospitalisation. The electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia, first-degree right bundle branch block, and ventricular and left atrial overload as well as diffuse and nonspecific disturbances of ventricular repolarization. Serological tests were conducted, and IgM (1.54 UI/mL) and IgG (2.5 UI/mL) were found positive only for CMV by using ELISA. The patient was diagnosed with cardiac insufficiency due to CMV myocarditis. He was treated with ganciclovir for 10 days and received supportive medication."
