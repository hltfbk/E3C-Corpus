  "text": "A 55-year-old edentulous Turkish female patient with a congenitally maxillary defect was rehabilitated with an open hollow obturator prosthesis. After the preliminary impression was completed, a metal frame suitable with the maxillary defect was constructed manually and used for making the impression of the defect area. After the first part of the obturator was finished, second part which separates nasal cavity and oral cavity was constructed by the aid of the bulb."
