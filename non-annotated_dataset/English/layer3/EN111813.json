  "text": "We report a case of pathological fracture of distal humerus due to SBC in a 16-year-old male. The fracture was treated surgically. Open reduction was done; curettage of cyst wall followed by non-vascularized fibula strut grafting was done and fixed with bicolumnar plating. Early post-operativemobilization was started. The patient had good outcome with incorporation of graft and healing of fracture and lesion."
