  "text": "A 58-year-old Japanese man with hilar bile duct cancer underwent percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization to expand the indication for hepatic resection. Two days after percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization, our patient suddenly complained of abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed a pseudoaneurysm arising from a segmental branch of his right hepatic artery. Since embolization of the hepatic arterial branches may cause hepatic infarction, ultrasound-guided thrombin injection therapy was successfully performed for the pseudoaneurysm."
