  "text": "We retrospectively studied 1 patient in Xiangya hospital and all relevant literature published in English between 1989 and 2015. The patients (including those reported in the literature) were characterized by age, origin, location of calculus, size of calculus, fistulous track, and etiological factors. Most of urethral calculi associated with a urethral fistula were native generated. Urethral calculi can be formed in various locations of the urethra, and the size of the calculus ranged from small (multiple) calculi to giant stones. The fistula external orifice located at the root of the penis was relatively common, and there were various etiological factors, such as urethral strictures, urethral trauma induced by long-term catheterization, lumbar fractures, and congenital anomaly factors. They were managed by the excision of the fistulous tract, retrieval of the urethral stones, and/or debridement and pus drainage operations."
