  "text": "We describe a 61-year-old female who presented with a two-week history of obstructive jaundice in the context of vague abdominal pain that had been ongoing for years prior to her visit. CT scan of the abdomen confirmed a hypovascular mass in the uncinate process consistent with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was confirmed with endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration cytology. Following multidisciplinary discussion, it was recommended that she undergo treatment with FOLFIRINOX. After a total of 13 cycles, follow up CT revealed that the lesion had decreased in size and she was offered resection as a potentially curative treatment. She underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. Final pathology report revealed no evidence of residual adenocarcinoma (ypT0 ypN0 (0/23)). The patient remains disease-free 15 months following surgery."
