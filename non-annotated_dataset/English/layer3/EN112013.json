  "text": "A 77-year-old woman visited our hospital with a chief complaint of anal bleeding and a palpable rectal mass. Colonoscopy revealed a 20-mm protruded lesion in the lower rectum. After obtaining biopsy specimens from the lesion, although a malignant rectal tumor was suspected, a definitive diagnosis was not made. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed tumor invasion into the submucosal layer but not the muscular layer. Therefore, we performed an excisional biopsy using ESD. Immunohistochemical examination of the ESD-resected specimen revealed tumor cells positive for Human Melanin Black-45, Melan-A, and S-100. Moreover, the tumor cells lacked melanin pigment; thus, a diagnosis of amelanotic AMM was made. Although the AMM had massively invaded the submucosal layer and both lymphatic and venous invasion were present, we closely monitored the patient without any additional therapy on the basis of her request. Six months after ESD, local recurrence was detected, and the patient consented to wide local excision."
