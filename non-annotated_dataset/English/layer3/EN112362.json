  "text": "A 40-year-old Caucasian man reporting pain, swelling, and functional reduction was evaluated and diagnosed with internal condyle osteochondritis dissecans of the knee. Harnessing the trophic, chondroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties of platelet-rich plasma, we carried out a knee open-sky surgical technique in which we combined autologous therapy with osteochondral allograft to treat the focal, large, and deep traumatic-iatrogenic osteochondritis dissecans of the knee. The axial computed tomographic scan taken 1 year after surgery revealed an area of abnormal signal intensity that was reduced on a computed tomographic scan 2 years later. The computed tomographic scan obtained 2 years later and the magnetic resonance imaging scan 3 years later also showed a clear reattachment and incorporation of the graft. Seven years after the surgery, the patient resumed his daily routine without any recurrent symptoms."
