  "text": "A 50-year old mentally disabled white male with a history of epilepsy presented with fever and a painless red macule on his right arm which rapidly progressed to a painful ulcer. Blood and lesion cultures revealed P.aeruginosa, confirming our clinical diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum. Subsequently an underlying immune deficit was found, namely patient was diagnosed with hairy-cell leukemia. Despite adequate antibiotics no infection control could be achieved. After treating the underlying immune deficit as well, the infection and hairy-cell leukemia resolved completely."
