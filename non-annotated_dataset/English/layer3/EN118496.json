  "text": "We report a synchronic fallopian tube adenocarcinoma and a verrucous cervical cancer. A 85-year-old woman with postmenopausal genital hemorrhage, endometrial biopsy was reported as squamous metaplasia, an exploratory laparotomy was performed finding a tubal tumor diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, a staging procedure was performed. Final staging revealed IB1 cervical carcinoma and IA G3 fallopian tube carcinoma. Adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy was not accepted by the patient. The patient has remained in follow-up, and at 9 months, there has been no documented evidence of recurrent disease."
