  "text": "We report the case of an SVN of the subtalar in a 60-year-old patient without particular histories, who consulted for a swelling of the external border of the right foot evolving for 2 years. Biology, as well as the standard radiographs, was without anomalies. The diagnosis was evoked on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and confirmed by surgical biopsy and excision. The operative follow-up was simple with no recurrence after 3 years."
