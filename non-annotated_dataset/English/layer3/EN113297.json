  "text": "A 78-year-old woman was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer with multiple lymph node metastases. Four months after the beginning of second-line chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel, she was admitted to our hospital because of fever and mild drowsiness. She had no other symptoms and no abnormalities in physical examinations. Her blood tests, urinalysis, and blood culture revealed no remarkable abnormal findings. Although her symptoms relieved, her disturbance of consciousness gradually progressed during 2 weeks thereafter. Finally, we diagnosed tuberculous meningitis on the 22nd day of hospitalization by a positive acid-fast bacilli test of the cerebrospinal fluid and tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction. Although anti-tuberculosis therapy was started, she died on the 37th day of hospitalization because of tumor bleeding."
