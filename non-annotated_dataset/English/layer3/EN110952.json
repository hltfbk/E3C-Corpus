  "text": "We report a 72-year-old male patient with intussusception. The patient underwent right hemicolectomy and cholecystectomy in our hospital on April 29, 2019. During operation, the ileum was inserted into the ascending colon by about 15 cm, and a tumor with a diameter of approximately 3.0 cm was observed in the distal part of the intestine. An atypical liposarcoma/highly differentiated liposarcoma in the adipose tissue was suspected in the postoperative pathology, and a lipoma was diagnosed after MDM2 gene testing. A 4.0 cm Ã— 5.0 cm polypoid mass was seen immediately adjacent to the mass, and the postoperative pathology report suggested a high-level tubular adenoma. The patient was eventually cured and discharged with an uneventful follow-up."
