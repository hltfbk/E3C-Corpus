  "text": "Herein a case is reported of a 60-year-old female patient who had an LMS of the thyroid, which was accompanied by periodic dysphonia and breathing disorder as well as the feeling of pressure in the chest and neck. At the time the disease was diagnosed, no metastases were detected. Prior to the diagnosis, the patient experienced a uterine adenocarcinoma that had been treated by surgical procedure and radiotherapy. For the LMS, a total thyroidectomy was performed, followed by radiotherapy. Since metastases were also discovered in the lungs, sternum, and femur, chemotherapy was administered as well. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells in the thyroid indicated positively for alpha smooth muscle actin, calponin, and H-caldesmon, but were negative for CD34, p63, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Epstein-Barr virus."
