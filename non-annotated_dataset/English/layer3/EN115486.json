  "text": "We report a case of a 44-year-old Caucasian man presenting with a three-month history of swelling of his right posterior mandible, related to an area of previous dental implant restoration. A clinical examination revealed modest extraoral facial swelling of his right posterior mandible, while an intraoral examination showed a 45 × 25 × 15 mm sessile, lobular soft tissue mass of the right posterior mandibular gingiva. The mucosal covering of the lesion exhibited focal surface ulceration. A panoramic radiograph showed two implants at the vicinity of the lesion with no other significant findings. An excisional biopsy of the lesion followed by histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen revealed salient and distinctive features of peripheral giant cell granuloma and of peripheral ossifying fibroma, estimated at near equal proportions. This raises the possibility of a hybrid odontogenic lesion."
