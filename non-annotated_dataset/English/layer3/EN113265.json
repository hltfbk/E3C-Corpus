  "text": "A 66-year-old Thai female was initially diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) and underwent programmable VP shunt placement. However, she still suffered from recurrent communicating hydrocephalus with in-place VP shunt, and later developed recurrent gait impairment, chronic abdominal pain and abdominal mass. Radiological studies demonstrated recurrent hydrocephalus and a very large intraabdominal VP shunt pseudocyst. C. gattii was isolated from both the cerebrospinal fluid and the pseudocyst aspiration. C. gattii meningitis complicating the VP shunt infection and concurrent infected intraabdominal VP shunt pseudocyst was diagnosed. Prolonged antifungal therapy, removal of the infected VP shunt with subsequent implant of a new shunt provided a good outcome."
