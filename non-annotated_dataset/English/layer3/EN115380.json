  "text": "10 weeks after aortic valve replacement, a 58-year-old male patient was readmitted with recent onset of unstable angina pectoris. Electrocardiography showed inverted T-waves in leads V2-4 with pseudonormalization during episodes of typical chest pain. Coronary angiography revealed subtotal ostial occlusion of the left anterior descending artery which was successfully treated by percutaneous coronary intervention."
