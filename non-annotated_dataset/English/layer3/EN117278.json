  "text": "A 14-year-old Arabic boy was presented to our hospital one year ago with a nodule of the right breast that was gradually increasing in size without signs of inflammation. The histological examination after lumpectomy revealed a periductal stromal sarcoma with free surgical margins. No adjuvant treatment was given. At 50 months of close follow-up, no recurrence was observed."
