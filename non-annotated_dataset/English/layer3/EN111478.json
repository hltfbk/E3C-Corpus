  "text": "A 23-year-old primagravida was diagnosed with a spontaneous renal rupture and acute left loin pain accompanied by hematuria when she was 35 weeks pregnant. A sub-capsular perinephric cyst then developed to a size of 319 × 175 × 253 mm, and because of discomfort to the patient, we performed Cesarean section. After a healthy male newborn was delivered, fluid was suctioned from a large perirenal cyst that had an estimated size of 300 × 200 × 300 mm. A percutaneous nephrostomy tube was left in the cyst until CT showed no remaining fluid. In the six-month follow-up, the patient showed no perirenal extravasation according to an ultrasound scan, and the urine analysis and renal function tests were normal."
