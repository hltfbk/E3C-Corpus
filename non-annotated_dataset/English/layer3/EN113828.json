  "text": "We report an unusual case of pancreatic herniation into the mediastinum in a 90-year-old Caucasian female. This patient initially presented with nausea and vomiting associated with abdominal pain. Serum lipase and amylase both were elevated. Computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed a large hiatal hernia with pancreas herniation into the mediastinum, with superimposed acute pancreatitis likely due to gallstone. Because of its unusual location, the patient also developed acute mediastinitis. The patient was management conservatively and did well. On the day of discharge; she was tolerating a diet, had no pain or nausea and was back to her baseline health."
