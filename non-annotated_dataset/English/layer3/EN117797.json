  "text": "We describe the first reported case of a hemangiopericytoma found in the sacrococcygeal space. A 47-year-old Japanese woman presented with a palpable tumor on the left side of her anus. Preoperative imaging indicated that the tumor was in the sacrococcygeal space without invasion of other organs. A complete resection was performed via a parasacral incision. The histological and immunohistochemical staining patterns supported the diagnosis of a hemangiopericytoma."
