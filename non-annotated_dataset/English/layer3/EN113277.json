  "text": "A 34-year-old male martial arts instructor presented with a constant and localized pain in the left hip and groin. Following the examination, the patient was diagnosed with left hip impingement and osteoarthritis. Due to his age and active lifestyle, the patient elected to undergo BHR rather than THA. The navigation tool was used to assist with acetabular reaming and to confirm final cup placement. Post- operatively, standard, anteroposterior pelvic radiographs showed a final cup position of 39.0° inclination and 24.7° anteversion, which was confirmed by the navigation tool. A pre-operative leg length differential of 3mm was measured from pre-operative radiographs; however, leg lengths were equalized following BHR."
