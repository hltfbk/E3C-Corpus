  "text": "A patient with high-risk thigh melanoma was staged with FDG PET-CT. Four ipsilateral inguinal nodes (three superficial, one deep) demonstrated intense hypermetabolic activity. Metastatic melanoma was confirmed in the largest superficial inguinal node with ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. Histopathology demonstrated metastatic melanoma in one superficial node and histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, also known as Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease in five deep inguinal nodes."
