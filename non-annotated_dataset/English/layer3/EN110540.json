  "text": "We present the case of a 32-year-old patient who was admitted to intensive care for febrile meningeal syndrome. She had no particular pathological history. On examination, she was sleepy, braycardia at 30 beats/min and hypotension at 85/60 mmHg; the temperature was 39.6Â°C. She showed no motor deficit or cranial nerve damage on neurological examination with the presence of stiff neck. Cardiac and pulmonary ausculation were normal. Full blood count revealed hyper-leukocytosis of 18.54 x 103/mm 3 with 85% neutrophils without anemia or thrombocytopenia. C-reactive protein level was 168 mg/l. renal function and calcemia were normal. Ultra-sensitive troponin slightly increased to 33 ng/ml who was not in favor of myocarditis. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar punction showed a protein content of 12 g/l with 590 white cells per mm 3, predominantly poly-nuclear neutrophils (80%). Glucorachia was 1.3 g/l. There was Streptococcus agalactiae (group B) confirmed to bacteriology. At admission, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a third degree sino-atrial block with bradycardia at 27 beats/min, enlargement of QRS with QT prolongation; ST segment and J point elevation in almost all leads: ST segment changes were convex upwards, camel saddle appearance evocative of Osborn waves. At transthoracic echocardiogram was normal with good ventricular contractility without image of vegetation or pericardial effusion. Chest X-ray and cerebral scanner were normal. The patient in the evening presented a state of shock with alteration of consciousness requiring mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. Despite aggressive supports with exogenous catecholamines, severe cardiovascular collapse persisted causing his death."
