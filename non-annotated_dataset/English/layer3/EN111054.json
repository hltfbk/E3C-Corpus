  "text": "We hereby report the case of a 60-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease who presented with the signs of PS after her treatment was switched to galantamine, a type of ChEI, even though she had received donepezil, another type of ChEI, for 5â€‰years without any complications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PS associated with treatment switch from one to another type of ChEI. Galantamine, but not other ChEIs, can enhance striatal dopamine release through allosteric modulation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and has weaker muscarinic effects than donepezil. Therefore, we propose two novel hypotheses to explain the development of PS, as follows; galantamine, which enhances dopamine release, can induce imbalance of dopamine levels in the striatum of patients with dementia, resulting in PS, and the weaker muscarinic effects of the drug could be one of the factors predisposing to the development of PS."
