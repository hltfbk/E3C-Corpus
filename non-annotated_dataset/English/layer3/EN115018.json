  "text": "A 47-year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our department with long-documented hyperopic shift and gradually decreasing vision in her left eye. Optical coherence tomography showed chorioretinal folds. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a retrobulbar mass which caused flattening of the posterior pole of the globe. The tumour was successfully removed, and was confirmed to be a cavernous haemangioma on histological assessment. 3 years after surgery the patient still has a similar amount of hyperopia and chorioretinal folds."
