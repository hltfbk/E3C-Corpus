  "text": "The patient is a 75-year-old woman who presented to clinic with problems of her left knee. She had a KineSpring joint unloading system implanted in March 2011 for severe medial osteoarthritis of her left knee that was unresponsive to maximal conservative treatment. After nearly 7 pain-free years, we successfully converted the KineSpring joint unloading system into a total knee replacement (Vega, Aesculap, Germany)."
