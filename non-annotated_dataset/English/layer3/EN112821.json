  "text": "A 65-year-old gentleman had presented with acute onset left-sided thigh pain, paraesthesia, and weakness along with lower backache. On deeper introspection, our patient had, in the recent past, been thrombolyzed for pulmonary embolism. The clinical examination led us to suspect an acute lumbar pathology, and he was investigated on those lines. Imaging studies, however, revealed a massive retroperitoneal hemorrhage which was the cause of femoral neuropathy. In this case report, the presentation of this rare association has been discussed with special emphasis on clinical premonition in the background of anticoagulant therapy. Watchful and medical treatment yielded successful recovery at follow-up."
