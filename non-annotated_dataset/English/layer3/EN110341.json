  "text": "A five-days-old newborn was referred to our department for an enormous lingual mass discovered at delivery. It was a normal 3,900 grams female, born by caesarean section performed because of failure to progress in labor. The Apgar score was 9/10 at 1 and 5 minutes of life. The ENT examination found a renitent mass of the tongue which measure 4 centimetres of large with a difficulty of suction but no respiratory signs. The ultrasonography has shown a cystic thin-walled lesion of 37 x 30 mm, with liquid-liquid level. The thyroid gland was normally located. A computed tomography had been performed to better characterize the lesion. It has shown a 36 mm large thin-walled cystic mass, which located in the anterior part of the tongue with a homogenous liquid-density content. A puncture with aspiration of the cyst content in object to reduce its size was done then a transoral complete resection of the lesion were performed with no post-operative complication and the infant was discharged two days later. The histological analysis of the specimen has confirmed the diagnosis of lingual thyroglossal duct cyst. There were no recurrence with a follow-up of eight months."
