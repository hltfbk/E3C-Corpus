  "text": "An 11-year-old boy with an acute onset of throbbing pain of two-day evolution located in the anterior chest wall. The patient reported a history of fever, cough and rhinorrhea during the last seven days. An anterior chest radiography revealed a heterogenic opacity at the lower right lobe while the lateral projection showed an obliteration at the anterior diaphragmatic insertion. Parenteral Ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg/day) and Dicloxacillin (200 mg/kg/day) was started. The abscess was subsequently drained and analyzed. After a year of follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic."
