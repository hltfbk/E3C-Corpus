  "text": "A 35-year-old Chinese female was admitted to hospital with one and half months history chest distress and chest pain. Patient reports a history of thoracic operation for mediastinal mass 14 years ago, and it was diagnosed UCD with hyaline vascular type after postoperative pathological examination. At this time, the imaging examination showed a mediastinal mass once again. Combining the medical history, postoperative microscopically examination and immunoperoxidase staining, patient was again diagnosed UCD with hyaline vascular type again. The hyaline vascular type is the most common type and usually presents as a UCD. Most patients with UCD have no clinical symptoms. The diagnosis of UCD is generally achieved with histological and immunohidtochemical findings postoperatively. Currently, the standard treatment of UCD is the complete surgical resection, with almost no relapse postoperative. The recurrence in UCD with hyaline vascular type postoperative have not previously been reported. Therefore, herein we describe a recurrence case of UCD with hyaline vascular type 14 years after surgery."
