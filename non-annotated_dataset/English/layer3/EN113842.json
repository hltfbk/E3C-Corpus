  "text": "We describe herein a patient with a history of stroke-like symptoms and retroperitoneal fibrosis that on initial pathology raised the possibility of IgG4-related disease. However, the patient was refractory to high-dose steroids and progressed further, developing an epicardial soft tissue mass and recurrent neurological symptoms. Integration of the above findings with new information at another hospital about a radiological history of symmetrical lower extremities long bone lesions raised the differential diagnosis of ECD. Molecular analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of both of the patient's retroperitoneal biopsies (the second one of which had shown a small focus of foamy histiocytes, CD68+/CD1a-) was positive for BRAF mutation, confirming the diagnosis of ECD. The patient demonstrated a dramatic and sustained metabolic response to vemurafenib on follow-up positron emission tomography scans."
