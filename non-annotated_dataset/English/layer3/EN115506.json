  "text": "I present the case of a 19-year-old Caucasian man with autism spectrum disorder treated with stimulant medication since early childhood. He experienced long-standing difficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships and reading social cues, and was socially isolated. Within 10 minutes of a single sublingual low dose of phenytoin there was an immediate observable improvement in his eye contact and integration of both verbal and non-verbal communication. This enhanced social functioning associated with his adherence to the low-dose phenytoin therapy was maintained for over 18 months of follow-up. These clinical observations were supported by ratings using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales, recorded pre-treatment and after seven months on 5mg phenytoin."
