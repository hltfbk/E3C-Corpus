  "text": "A 28- year-old female who had a history of tow caesareans. She was, also, operated 8 months before for a desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall. She was referred to our hospital for a growing mass of the lower abdominal wall. Clinical examination revealed a 10 cm mass of the left iliaca fossa, which was fixed to the pubic bone. Abdominal computed tomography scan (CT scan) demonstrated an heterogeneous para-ombilical tumor involving the left rectus abdominis muscle. We concluded to a recurrent desmoid tumor of the abdominal wall. The surgery was performed within the existent midline abdominal incision. The mass was originating from the left rectus abdominis muscle, arising from the ombilicus to the pubic bone in which it was strongly adhered. It extended to the limit with the inguinal ligament, to abdominal transversal and oblique muscles and to bladder on its anterior surface. The tumor was totally removed respecting at least 2 cm of margin with healthy tissue. The resection included left rectus muscle and both oblique muscles. The resulting defect in the abdominal wall measured 15/15 cm. it was repaired by a double layer mesh which was covered by a bepedicled flap using the anterior fascia of the controlateral rectus abdominis, combined with an advancement of the posterior fascia after a dissection between the residual external and internal oblique muscles. The patient recovery was uneventful and she was discharged at the 5th postoperative day. Histological examination of the specimen showed a desmoid tumor with free margins. The outcome 13 months later didn?t show any local recurrence or incisional hernia."
