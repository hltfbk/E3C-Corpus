  "text": "A 35-year-old woman was evaluated for a DH that had been detected during a preoperative examination for myopic refractive surgery. Enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging of the optic nerve revealed a peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation adjacent to the DH. The DH was also present at the 1-year follow-up, but had been completely absorbed at the 2-year follow-up, respectively with an enlargement and shrinkage of the intrachoroidal cavitation and prelaminar tissue schisis. Glaucomatous optic nerve change was not observed during the entire follow-up."
