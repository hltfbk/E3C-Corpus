  "text": "An 84-year-old male was admitted with a history of difficulty rising from a chair and a fall. Laboratory results showed increased creatine kinase levels of more than 50 times the normal reference values. Electromyography (EMG) showed myopathic changes, and FDG-PET/CT scan showed increased FDG uptake in bilateral quadriceps. A biopsy was performed revealing lymphocytic predominant infiltrates and myonecrosis. Prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were administered with strength improvement. The patient was discharged for further follow-up."
