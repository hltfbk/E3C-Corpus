  "text": "In this case report, concomitant intraoral distraction and gap arthroplasty was planned to treat TMJ ankylosis and associated facial asymmetry. After gap arthroplasty and 23 mm of distraction, the ramus-condyle segment was successfully lengthened and mouth opening range was significantly increased. The resultant interocclusal space was stably maintained with an occlusal splint for 4 months after distraction. Finally, good occlusion was achieved after prosthetic treatment. The remaining mandibular asymmetry was corrected with osseous contouring and augmentation surgery. The mouth-opening range was maintained at 35 mm 24 months after treatment."
