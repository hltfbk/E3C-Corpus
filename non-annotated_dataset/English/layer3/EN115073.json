  "text": "A 63-year-old woman who had been treated with tocilizumab (TCZ), anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody, for RA presented to our outpatient clinic due to hemoptysis. She was diagnosed with pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showed a single cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. After diagnosis of pulmonary MAC disease, TCZ was discontinued and combination chemotherapy with clarithromycin, rifampicin, ethambutol and amikacin was started for MAC pulmonary disease. Since the lesion was limited in the right upper lobe as a single cavity formation, she underwent right upper lobectomy. As her RA symptoms were deteriorated around the operation, TCZ was resumed. After resumption of TCZ, her RA symptoms improved and a recurrence of pulmonary MAC infection has not been observed for more than 1 year."
