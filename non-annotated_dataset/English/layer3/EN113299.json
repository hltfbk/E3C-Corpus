  "text": "A 74-year-old female patient presented with the feeling of an abdominal growing mass. Complex medical history included a subtotal colectomy with an end ileostomy and a mucous fistula at the descending colon due to Crohn disease at the age of 16 years. MRI showed a massive dilatation of the remaining colon and the rectum. Endoscopy failed due to complete anal stenosis and stenosis of the descending colon at the stoma site. A total proctocolectomy was performed. The pathology report showed a dilated rectum and sigma with large amounts of partly calcified mucus. There was no evidence of dysplasia, malignancy, or Crohn manifestation in the completely obliterated proximal colon and the anus."
