  "text": "A 29-year-old female patient was referred to our department by her ophthalmologist for investigation and treatment of peripheral retinal neovascularization in her right eye(RE). Visual acuity(VA) at presentation was 20/200 RE and 20/20 LE. Fundoscopy of the RE revealed a chronic inferotemporal retinal detachment and peripheral neovascularization with a sea fan configuration. Fundoscopy of the LE was without any findings. Fluorescein angiography confirmed the sea fan neovascularization in the RE with leakage of the newly formed vessels and peripheral ischemia while the LE did not demonstrate any neovascularization angiographically. Family history was negative for retinitis pigmentosa and haemoglobinopathies. Patient underwent full blood count and haemoglobin electrophoresis to exclude thrombocytosis and sickle cell anaemia, and serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) measurement to exclude sarcoidosis. Examination with scleral indentation of the RE revealed 2 peripheral small retinal holes close to the ora serrata . The patient underwent a scleral buckling procedure with a small segmental buckle limited to the area of the holes and cryotherapy. Ccryotherapy was not applied to the area with neovascularization and no subretinal fluid drainage was performed. The detached retina was successfully re-attached surgically and the subretinal fluid was gradually absorbed within three months from the time of surgery. Complete regression of neovascularization was evident 2Â months postoperatively and VA improved to 20/30. Three years later the clinical and functional findings remain unchanged."
