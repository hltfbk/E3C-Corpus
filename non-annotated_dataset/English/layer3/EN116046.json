  "text": "A case of a 64-year-old African American gentleman presented to the otolaryngology with a 3-month history of recurrent epistaxis. Imaging revealed a large right nasal cavity mass extending into the right sphenoid sinus but without intracranial extension. Surgical pathology revealed high-grade ENB invading IP. An orbitofrontal craniotomy approach was used to achieve complete resection of the mass but with positive margins. Post-operative positron emission tomography/computed tomography showed nodal metastasis. The patient was then treated with adjuvant chemoradiation and remains without evidence of disease at 42â€‰months post-treatment. We discuss the disease presentation, histopathologic features, and disease management with literature support."
