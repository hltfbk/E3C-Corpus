  "text": "A 56-year-old woman with a history of right radical nephrectomy for a renal clear cell carcinoma diagnosed 10 years earlier was referred for abdominal distension and pelvic pain. Color-Doppler US and Computer Tomography scan revealed the presence of bilateral ovarian masses with regular margins, a low resistance index and poor contrast enhancement. Immunohistochemistry showed positive epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin, vimentin and CD10, suggesting clear cells from the previously diagnosed kidney cancer."
