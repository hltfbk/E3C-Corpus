  "text": "The present case was a 39-year-old woman with a left ovarian carcinoma who demonstrated a germline splice variant of PTEN (c.1026 + 1G > T) following genome-wide whole exome sequencing of her germline DNA. Histology of her resected tumor revealed endometrioid carcinoma of the same type as a right ovarian cancer resected eight years previously. These tumors showed null immunostaining for PTEN. She was genetically diagnosed with CS. Despite her clinical examinations had demonstrated several characteristic findings of CS, including mammary fibroma, esophageal and skin papilloma, colonic hamartoma, uterine myoma, and lipoma, the clinicians could not approach this diagnosis."
