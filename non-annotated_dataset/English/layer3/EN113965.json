  "text": "A 36-year-old woman with mitochondrial myopathy was scheduled for caesarean section under a combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia and multi-model analgesia. The parturient was safe and the delivery was performed safely and smoothly, but there were some complications after surgery due to the complex condition of the patient. After consultation with and treatment from multiple disciplines, both the parturient and neonate were well and discharged."
