  "text": "We report the case of a 55-year-old Caucasian man, who presented with a one-month history of abdominal pain and weight loss. He was diagnosed with a primary liver tumor by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Alpha-fetoprotein levels ranged within normal limits. A right posterior sectorectomy was performed. Histopathology revealed an inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. Our patient remains in good condition one year later."
