  "text": "A 79-year-old man presented to our clinic complaining of a 1-mo history of painless scrotal swelling. Physical examination revealed approximately a 15 cm × 10 cm × 5 cm inguinal mass with limited mobility. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed a hydrocele testis, several enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, and a heterogeneously enhanced lesion with a relatively well-defined margin in the left inguinal region. Due to the imaging findings, he was diagnosed with pleomorphic RMS and received a wide resection of the mass, an inguinal incision with a high section of the left spermatic cord, and a left radical orchiectomy. He experienced local relapse 1 mo postoperatively and received radiotherapy and anlotinib hydrochloride-based immunotherapy as adjuvant therapy. The patient died 3 mo after the surgery."
