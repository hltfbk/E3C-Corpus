  "text": "An 81-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with diarrhea and acute renal failure. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging examinations revealed an 80-mm-sized enhanced tumor located in her lower rectum without lymph node swelling and distant metastasis. A giant villous tumor secreting mucus was seen in the lower rectum to the anal canal during colonoscopy. The result of tumor biopsy was adenocarcinoma. To preserve the anal function and ensure distal margin, we chose TaTME for curative resection. After improving the electrolyte imbalance, TaTME was performed successfully and R0 resection was achieved. There was no sign of recurrence or electrolyte depletion for 1Â year after the surgery."
