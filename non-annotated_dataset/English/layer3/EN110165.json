  "text": "A 60 year old patient, who had been recently diagnosed of a non-metastatic adenocarcinoma of the rectum, presents with a painful swelling of the perineum and scrotum that had began 15 days prior to his admission, associated with fever and altered general condition. Physical examination found an altered, feverish patient, up to 39Â°C with a reddish, hot and painful swelling with areas of necrosis extending from the perineum to the root of the penis involving the scrotum. Digital rectal examination revealed a circumferential bulging tumor located 3 cm from the anal margin. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis (18,900/mm 3) and elevated C-reactive protein levels (697 mg/l). Abdominal and pelvic CT scan objectified an extra peritoneal perforated and necrotic huge rectal tumor with a massive infiltration of the perineum containing air bubbles. However, there was no intra-peritoneal effusion found. The patient was put on broad spectrum antibiotics. Excision of necrotic tissues with an elective sigmoid colectomy was performed. Treatment of the rectal cancer will only be considered after complete control of the infection."
