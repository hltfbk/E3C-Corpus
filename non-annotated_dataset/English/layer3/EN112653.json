  "text": "A 23-year-old European woman presented at an out-patient clinic with a 9-month history of a painless swelling on the right posterolateral side of her chest wall. The case reported here is of a very rarely seen parosteal osteosarcoma of the rib that was treated with wide resection and chest wall reconstruction. There was no evidence of local recurrence or distal metastasis after a 1-year follow-up."
