  "text": "A 3â€‰days old male neonate with imperforate anus presented with abdominal distention. Loop colostomy was done to relieve abdominal distension. The chest x-ray revealed a curved shadow on the right mid lung zone extending to the diaphragm abutting and indenting the inferior vena cava (scimitar sign). Abdominal ultrasound, transthoracic echocardiography and computerized tomographic angiography confirmed the presence of Scimitar vein and associated dextro-position of the heart, hypoplastic right lung, hypoplastic right pulmonary artery, secundum atrial septal defect with bidirectional shunt, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary hypertension, left superior vena cava, and systemic collateral arteries feeding the lower lobe of the right lung. The rare association of scimitar syndrome with imperforate anus is discussed."
