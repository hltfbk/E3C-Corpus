  "text": "A 27-year-old nulliparous Japanese woman at 39 gestational weeks had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery of a 3244-g infant. However, her placenta was not delivered, and we could not remove it manually. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging indicated deep myometrial invasion by placental tissue and the whole placenta was strongly enhanced. Seven days post-partum, her serum human chorionic gonadotropin level was 12,656IU/L. Our patient hoped to preserve her uterus for a future pregnancy. She therefore received 13 courses of methotrexate (50mg/week, intravenous injection). Her serum human chorionic gonadotropin level was undetectable 97 days after the first methotrexate injection. At 117 days post-partum, she had a labor-like pain every three minutes and delivered the placenta. Our patient regained normal menses and at follow-up remained in good health. Two years later, she delivered a healthy daughter."
