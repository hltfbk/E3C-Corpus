  "text": "In present case, 37 year old G5P4 (Caesarean Section) women was admitted to Adnan Menderes University, Obstetrics and Gynecology clinic with diagnosis of missed abortion at 18 weeks' gestation. She had been hospitalized in a public maternity hospital for five days due to abortus incipience and prolapse of amnion membranes but had no contractions. There was no history of rupture of amnion membranes. Fetal heart beats (FHBs) were determined positive during the first three days of hospitalization in the public maternity hospital. However, FHB ceased at the fourth day. Medically induced abortion was recommended but was not accepted by patient. Patient preferred and wished expectant management. During the follow up at maternity hospital, infection markers were all normal and there was no fever. At the fifth day, she was referred to our clinic due to deterioration of general health condition, low blood pressure and tachycardia. In emergency department, it was determined that she was not oriented, had confusion, had blood pressure of 49/25 mmHg, tachycardia (145 beats/min) and body temperature was 36.6°C. She had hyperventilation and oxygen saturation was 88%. First of all, bolus hydration with isotonic solutions and oxygen treatment was performed. In complete blood count she had hemoconcentration (Hemotocrit: 44%). In ultrasonographic examination, 18 weeks in utero ex fetus was determined and there was free fluid in abdominopelvic cavity. The free fluid was suspected to be amniotic fluid due to rupture of uterus. So, laparotomy was performed due to suspicion of uterine rupture and clinical deterioration. Through the vertical incision, ex fetus was taken out. However during that procedure, a very bad smelling odor, which might be due to septicemia, was felt in the operation room. But there was no uterine rupture, hematoma, atony. Only little amount of serous fluid was determined in abdominal cavity. We thought that this fluid was due to extravasation of intercellular and intravascular fluid. Despite aggressive hydration therapy including blood products, by central venous catheterization, she had persistant bradycardia and hypotension. Vasopressin (0.03 units/min) was given to increase mean blood pressure to at least 60 mm Hg. Epinephrine was added as second drug. Dobutamine as an inotropic was also given. During operation, cardiac arrest occurred. Despite all resuscitation efforts, patient was accepted as exitus after half an hour. Autopsy was performed and in autopsy report, it was concluded that maternal death might be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) because of remaining of ex fetus in uterus for a long time."
