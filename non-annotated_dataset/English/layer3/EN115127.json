  "text": "We report the case of a patient with ITP who underwent three separate coronary interventions. The first PCI with stenting was performed in the left anterior descending artery 5 years ago while the patient suffered an anterior acute myocardial infarction, and the platelet count at admission was 90 × 10(9)/L. The patient presented with recurrent ACS and severe in-stent restenosis 5 years after the first PCI, and the platelet count at admission was 18 × 10(9)/L, and elevated to 87 × 10(9)/L after platelets transfusion. He was treated successfully with cutting balloon angioplasty under anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin and antiagregation with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel. Four months later after cutting balloon angioplasty, the patient received an intracoronary stent when he once again presented with recurrent ACS in the setting of restenosis. The patient has been observed for 1.5 years without restenosis after the third PCI."
