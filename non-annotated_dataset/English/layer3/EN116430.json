  "text": "A 51- year old woman, with known CDH1 mutation carrier status and a prior history of lobular breast carcinoma underwent prophylactic total gastrectomy which revealed multifocal intramucosal signet ring cell carcinoma. An appendectomy was performed at the same time due to a prior episode of presumed appendicitis, with pathologic examination significant for a primary signet ring cell carcinoma of the appendix."
