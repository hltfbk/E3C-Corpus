  "text": "A 33-year-old gravida 8, para 3 woman was referred to thegynecology service with an approximate gestational age of 9 weeks and 2 days. Presenting complaints included vaginal bleeding and intermittent lower abdominal cramping of 7 days duration; fever 38 ° c\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable. The initial level of serum hCG was positive.\nOn pelvic examination, there was mild spotting, the cervical os was closed and the cervix tender on transverse motion. The uterus was bulky; there was fullness in all the fornices with tenderness; and the adnexae were difficult to palpate. Haematological examination showed: white cell count 22 × 10 3 cells/L, haemoglobin 8.5 g/dL and haematocrit 29,4%.\nA transvaginal pelvic ultrasound examination revealed an empty uterus with a right adnexal mass with sac gestationnel, positive cardiac activity, LCC 14mm and an important amount of fluid collection was present in the pouch of Douglas.\nThe patient's past gynaecologic history included a previous therapeutic abortion. She had no history of sexually transmitted infections or previous abdomino-pelvic surgery. She was other wise healthy. The patient was counselled concerning the possibility of anectopic pregnancy, and informed consent for laparotomyexploration with the possible need for salpingostomy orsalpingectomy was obtained. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed haemoperitoneum of approximately 2000 mL. There was a ruptured fimbrial ectopic pregnancy with active bleeding on the right side. The left tube showed an intact ectopic pregnancy 10 cm in the ampullary region that was bleeding and forming an organized haematoma at the fimbrial end.\nWe considered it possible that the patient had bilateralspontaneous ectopic pregnancies and In view of these findings, we decided to perform bilateral retrograde salpingectomy. The patient received 2 units of type O Rh negative blood. Postoperative follow-up was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 5 th day post-operation.\nThe pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of spontaneousbilateral tubal pregnancies, showing blood clot admixed with chorionic villi in the tissue removed from the right tube. The tissue obtained from the left tube showed multiple fragments of fetal tissue, including the vertebral column, neurological structures, liver, intestine, umbilical cord, and chorionic villi."
