  "text": "We report a case of a 43-year-old male who sustained an electrical shock injury following which he fell from a height of around 4 feet. Radiological studies confirmed bilateral transcervical neck of femur fracture. Laboratory investigations revealed the patient had extremely low levels of vitamin D (11.1ng/ml). Patient was treated with three 6.5 mm cannulated cancellous screws on each side. Patient had good functional outcome at the end of one year."
