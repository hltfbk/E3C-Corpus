  "text": "A 34-year-old Asian woman presented with a rapidly growing left perineal mass and swelling in the left gluteal region. The swelling was associated with a mild, dull pain in the left gluteal region. In the present case of bulky aggressive angiomyxoma extending to the perineum and retroperitoneal space, the authors made an inverted Y incision through the buttock, removed the coccyx and lower portion of the sacrum, and excised the retroperitoneal mass and perineal lesion through a perineal approach."
