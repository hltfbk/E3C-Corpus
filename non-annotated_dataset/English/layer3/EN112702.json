  "text": "Here, we present clinical and molecular findings in a male patient with clinical signs of Dent disease, developmental delay, short stature, microcephaly, and facial dysmorphism. Using molecular karyotyping we identified a hemizygous interstitial microdeletion Xp11.23p.11.22 of about 700â€‰kb, which was inherited from his asymptomatic mother. Among the six deleted genes is CLCN5, which explains the renal phenotype in our patient. SHROOM4, which is partially deleted in this patient, is involved in neuronal development and was shown to be associated with X-linked intellectual disability. This is a candidate gene, the loss of which is thought to be associated with his further clinical manifestations. To rule out mutations in other genes related to intellectual disability, whole exome sequencing was performed. No other pathogenic variants that could explain the phenotypic features, were found."
