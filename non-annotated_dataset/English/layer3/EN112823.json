  "text": "We report the case of bilateral RDO in a Caucasian 84-year-old female treated with a bilateral total hip replacement and propose an etiology for this condition. This is the first case that specifically mentions obtaining cultures intraoperatively as a definitive diagnostic method. It is also a rare case as it describes a patient with the bilateral rapid destruction of the hip joints."
