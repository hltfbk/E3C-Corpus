  "text": "A 21 year old patient was examined, who complained of pain and swelling in the left shoulder for 2 years. MRI showed a large amount of rice bodies with joint effusion in the left shoulder with intact rotator cuff. The histological examination showed a tuberculosis-specific inflammatory response with giant cells and epithelioid granulomas. Arthroscopic debridement and removal of the loose bodies was done. A brief summary of the literature is given."
