  "text": "This study reports a case of a 35-year-old female patient with ASPS of the left thigh with lung metastasis. The patient presented with a 1-year history of a palpable mass in the lower extremity, which exhibited rapid growth for 3 wk. CT, MRI, and F-deoxyglucose PET/CT examinations were performed. CT showed a slightly hypodense or isodense mass with patchy calcifications. On MRI examination, the mass manifested hyperintensity on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted images with some signal voids. PET/CT images demonstrated an intensely hypermetabolic mass in the left thigh and hypermetabolic nodules in lungs."
