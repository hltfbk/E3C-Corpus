  "text": "We report a case of hip dislocation resulting from an intra-articular neurofibroma in an 18-year-old Caucasian woman following minor trauma. This was originally suggested by the abnormalities on early radiographs of her pelvis and later confirmed with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment was successful with skeletal traction for six weeks with no further hip dislocations at a 12-year follow-up."
