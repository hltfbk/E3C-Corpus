  "text": "A healthy 35-year-old Asian man underwent an uncomplicated office vasectomy. Soon after, he noticed vague chest pain and dyspnea. Lower extremity Doppler ultrasound revealed acute venous thrombosis. A computer-assisted tomography angiogram revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli. Extensive laboratory work-up failed to identify thrombophilia. He has not had any recurrences in the eight years since the initial presentation."
