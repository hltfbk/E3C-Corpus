  "text": "Here we present a novel de novo NAA10 (NM_003491.3) c.[47A > C];[=] (p.[His16Pro];[=]) variant identified in a young female. The 10-year-old girl has severely delayed motor and language development, disturbed behavior with hyperactivity and restlessness, moderate dilatation of the ventricular system and extracerebral CSF spaces. Her blood leukocyte X-inactivation pattern was skewed (95/5) towards the maternally inherited X-chromosome. Our functional study indicates that NAA10 p.(H16P) impairs NatA complex formation and NatA catalytic activity, while monomeric NAA10 catalytic activity appears to be intact. Furthermore, cycloheximide experiments show that the NAA10 H16P variant does not affect the cellular stability of NAA10."
