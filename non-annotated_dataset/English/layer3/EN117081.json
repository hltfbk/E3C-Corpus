  "text": "An 84-year-old Asian man treated with isoniazid, along with rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol for suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis, presented with a recurrent pleural effusion, his third episode since the initiation of this therapy. The first effusion occurred one month after the start of treatment, without any prior evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis involvement. Follow-up testing, including thoracoscopic pleural biopsies, never confirmed tuberculosis infection. Further evaluation yielded serological evidence suggesting drug-induced lupus. No effusions recurred following the discontinuation of isoniazid, although other antituberculosis medications were continued."
