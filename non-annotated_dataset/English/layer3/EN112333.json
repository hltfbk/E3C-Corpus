  "text": "The patient, a 23-year-old pregnant woman, presented with sudden-onset headache, dizziness, and severe hypertension (blood pressure, 170/110 mmHg). Brain MR imaging (MRI) revealed T2 hyperintense lesions in the posterior circulation territories. Immediate cesarean section was performed, and the patient received intravenous infusion of mannitol (125 ml, q8h) for 8 days for the treatment of PRES. Ten days later, or 1 day after the discontinuation of mannitol, T2-weighted MRI showed that the hyperintense lesions (vasogenic edema) had disappeared. However, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping revealed an isolated lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum (SCC) that was accompanied by restricted diffusion (cytotoxic edema); these findings indicated reversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES). Five days after the discontinuation of mannitol, she had no abnormal symptoms and was discharged from our hospital. Brain MRI performed 29 days after the clinical onset of symptoms showed no abnormalities."
