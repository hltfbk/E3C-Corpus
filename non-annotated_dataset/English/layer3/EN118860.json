  "text": "A 58-year-old man presented to our institution for regular follow up, 2 years after a right radical nephrectomy with preservation of the ipsilateral adrenal gland, for a primary renal cell carcinoma. The patient remained asymptomatic but an abdominal computed tomography scan on follow up revealed a 6.5 x 4 cm2 mass in the left adrenal gland. A positron emission tomography scan was also performed to rule out other possible metastases, and a magnetic resonance imaging scan was used for accurate localization and determination of resectability of the adrenal tumour. A bone scan, metabolic screen, liver and renal function tests were all within normal limits. A laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy was then performed. The postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day two. The patient remains in satisfactory condition and no recurrence or adrenal insufficiency has been observed during 12 months follow up."
