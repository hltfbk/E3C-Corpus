  "text": "A 56-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), no other comorbidities and no known renal disease was admitted to the hospital with acute kidney injury (AKI) and nephrotic syndrome. Physical examination was unremarkable except for anasarca. Renal ultrasound revealed no abnormalities. Laboratory and urine analyses were consistent with the nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Serological studies regarding ANA, ANCA, anti-PLA2R autoantibodies, complement, virus infections, immunofixation and quantitative light chain analysis were unremarkable. A renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopic examination showed flattened tubular epithelium consistent with acute tubular damage, no infiltrates and unremarkable glomeruli except diffuse and global holes in the GBM and negative staining for immunoglobulin heavy-chains, light-chains and complement split products. Electron microscopy revealed a rare correlate for these holes: global peculiar infolding of podocyte cytoplasm into the GBM. Most of these infoldings were accompanied by condensation of the GBM underneath. No such condensation or electron dense deposits were found without these infoldings or outside the GBM."
