  "text": "A rare case of APL was reported after IRF2BP2-RARA was detected in the relapsed process using next-generation RNA-sequencing analysis. In addition, the mutation of NRAS was also detected. ATRA and arsenic trioxide combined with daunorubicin were used during induction treatment. The patient acquired complete remission but relapsed in 12Â months. The patient was resistant to all other chemotherapies and refused any further therapy. The literature review indicated that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation might be a therapeutic method to treat APL with IRF2BP2-RARA fusion."
