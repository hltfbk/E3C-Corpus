  "text": "A 34-year-old recently diagnosed HIV positive para 4 was referred to us with a 2-month history of abdominal pain, abdominal distension and backache which had worsened 2 weeks prior to presentation. She also had pain on defecation, night sweats and fever. On examination she looked ill, in respiratory distress with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per min. She was febrile with a temperature of 38.2 0 C and had unilateral leg swelling. The abdomen was asymmetrically distended with an abdominopelvic mass of about 30 weeks size. The mass was firm, immobile with an irregular surface not attached to overlying skin. There was no ascites and no hepatosplenomegaly. The cervix looked grossly normal but was displaced anteriorly. Digital rectal examination revealed a mass in the pouch of Douglas not involving the rectal mucosa. Examination of the other systems was normal. Investigations showed a haemoglobin of 6.5g/dl (NR 12-14g/dl), a slightly elevated cancer antigen 125 of 44U/ml (NR 0-35), serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) of 0.258mIU/ml (NR 0-5) and alpha fetoprotein of 7 ng/ml (NR < 10). Her CD4 count was 63cells/mm 3. Her renal and hepatic function tests were normal. An ultrasound scan showed a solid mass measuring 19.6cm x 12.5cm, posterior to the uterine fundus and extending to the left adnexa. The uterus and its endometrium were normal. Doppler ultrasound scan of the right lower limb showed no evidence of thrombosis and her chest X-ray showed perihilar lymphadenopathy. The patient was taken for surgical exploration and staging for ovarian malignancy. At laparotomy there was a left ovarian mass attached to a bulky uterus and sigmoid colon. The right ovary was enlarged to about 10cm diameter. The left fallopian tube and ovary could not be distinguished and separated from the tumour. The rest of the abdominal organs and omentum looked grossly normal. There was no ascites. Tumour was friable and was removed by blunt and sharp dissection. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy and infracolic omentectomy were done. The general surgeons were present and they did a sigmoidectomy and a Hartmann's procedure. She had enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes which were not dissected to reduce intraoperative bleeding and postoperative morbidity. We had encountered significant bleeding from the friable tumor. Patient was sent to the high dependency unit where she recovered postoperatively. Histology of the specimens showed a large B cell lymphoma. A haematologist consulted and peripheral blood film and bone marrow aspirate were done. Both results were normal, ruling out abnormal cells in both samples. She was started on chemotherapy one month after surgery and by the time of writing she had received one cycle of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and vincristine. She has also been initiated on highly active antiretroviral therapy."
