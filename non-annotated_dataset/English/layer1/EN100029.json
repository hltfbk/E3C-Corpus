  "text": "A 17 year-old woman with a history of moderate persistent allergic asthma has benefited from a first desensitization protocol at age 3. The protocol has been interrupted 4 years later because of a mild skin reaction. Her doctor decided to stop the specific immunotherapy. But another doctor restarted a new protocol of desensitization at age 16 against pollens because of a lack of control of his condition. She was never hospitalized, she was receiving no medication and she was doing well one year after she received a new regimen of pneumallergens (AlustalÂ® Stallergenes SA, France). Indeed, 12 hours after initiation of treatment, she complained of abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea without fever. Several hours after, she consulted to the emergency department where a surgical emergency was ruled out. She was then admitted to the internal medicine ward. Two days later, she developed an acute respiratory failure and was referred to the intensive care unit where laboratory tests revealed multiorgan failure: liver enzymes, 5000U/L (normal level, 0-37U/L); creatine phosphokinase, 59000U/L (normal level, 10-200U/L); cardiac troponin T, 21ng/ml (normal level, under 0,01ng/ml); leucopenia, 2600/mm 3 (normal level, 4000-9000/ mm 3); thrombocytopenia, 13000/ mm 3 (normal level, 150000-400000/ mm 3); prothrombin time, 38% (normal level, 70-100%). Chest X-ray demonstrated bilateral interstitial markings with a normal cardiac silhouette. Viral serology was normal for hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, Epstein-Barr virus and Cytomegalovirus. A skin morbilliform rash and facial edema appeared later. The patient received a fluid resuscitation, platelet and erythrocyte transfusion, steroids and antibiotics. A hypoxic coma occurred on day 4 leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. Rapidly, she experienced intractable shock and acute renal impairment despite inotropic agents leading to death on day 5."
