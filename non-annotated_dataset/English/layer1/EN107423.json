  "text": "A 16-year-old Indian boy presented to our hospital with a history of a lump in the lower back region since birth. Initially, it was small, but its size increased gradually over time to a size of 15 cm Ã— 15 cm at presentation. There were no other associated abnormalities. Investigations revealed the lump to be a benign cystic teratoma. The patient underwent surgery, and the whole tumor, from its base to the vertebrae, was excised. Bisection of the tumor revealed that it contained hair and pultaceous material consistent with a teratoma, which was later confirmed by histopathologic examination."
