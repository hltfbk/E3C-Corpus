  "text": "A 62-year-old woman presented with complaints of epigastric pain and vomiting. Computed tomography showed a 27-mm, hyper-enhancing tumor in the prepyloric antrum. Upper endoscopy also showed a submucosal tumor causing subtotal obstruction of the gastric outlet. Because a gastrointestinal stromal tumor was suspected, distal gastrectomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed spindle cell proliferation in the submucosal layer. The spindle cells had invaded the muscularis propria layer and extended to the subserosal layer. The tumor was finally diagnosed as an IFP based on immunohistochemical findings. No mutations were identified in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) gene via molecular genetic analysis."
