  "text": "Mr F.B a 70-year-old male patient presented in our institution because of the occurrence of a right epistaxis. First of all, the patient is not smoking and reported an aneurysm of the abdominal aorta surgically treated by prosthesis under plavix. The beginning of the symptomatology goes back to 2 months before with right nasal obstruction of progressive onset, associated with right epistaxis and bloody rhinorrhea with right chronic eye watering. Nasal Endoscopy examination revealed a pinnkish burgeoning mass bleeding on contact and filling the right nostril vestibule. The patient didn't presents neurological signs nor cervical lymph nods. Otherwise, ophthalmologic examination found normal visual acuity and ocular mobility on both sides. Sinonasal computed tomography (CT) found a right nasal process enhanced after injection of contrast product with relatively little washing at the late time. Otherwise, there is no extension involvement at the level of the cavum and the pterygo palate fossa. This finding found also a crenate appearance of the posterior nasal mucosa especially of the middle turbinates and contralateral inferior turbinate with a left deviation of the nasal septum with nasal spur. Nasosinusal MRI shows a progressive increase in size of the tissue mass compared to the previously CT occupying the right nasal fossa on almost all of its height, measuring 4 × 2.8 × 3.5cm without extension within the cavum with probable invasion of the lower part of the nasolacrimal duct and mass effect on both the sinusonasal bone septum and the intersinusonasal septum. This finding shows ethmoidal sinus fluid retention. The appearance, even if it remains unspecific, is compatible with inverted papilloma. The patient underwent complete endoscopic removal of the tumor with ethmoidectomy and right maxillary antrostomy. The extemporaneous examination is in favor of a malignant tumor lesion. Histopathologic analysis shows a tumor proliferation made of polymorphic cells with major anisocytosis, most often located in lobules. There is sometimes a somewhat palisadic seat on the periphery of the tumor mass. The mitotic index is 10 mitoses per 10 high power fields. The immunohistochemical study of the tumor found that the cytokeratin KL1 and CK7 and the neuroendocrine marker Chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CD56 are positive. Proliferation index Ki67 is of the order of 80%. Otherwise there is an absence of expression of PS100, MelanA, HMB45, desmin, p40, CD45 and EBV.\nThe clear positivity of cytokeratins formally excludes the diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma and leads to neuroendocrine carcinoma. Given the atypia, the mitotic index, and the Ki67 proliferation index, it is a high-grade large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Extension assessment, comprising a PET SCAN, was negative. Postoperative treatment consisted in adjuvant polychemotherapy, with six cycles (cisplatin and etoposide), Followed by loco regional external radiotherapy. After 6 month follow-up, the patient was in complete clinical and radiological remission."
