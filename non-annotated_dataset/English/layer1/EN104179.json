  "text": "Forty year old male presented with a huge mass in this left arm. The same patient apparently was admitted three years back for excision of the arm swelling which was relatively small that time. However the patient did not undergo surgery and was takin treatment from local bone setters during the last three years and tumor grew to a larger size during this period. The current dimensions of tumor was 32x28 cms with circumference of 87 cms. X-ray showed complete destruction of the upper humerus with central calcification. Biopsy releveled a chondrosarcoma. Skeletal survey and bone scan did not reveal any other lesion in the body. A forequarter amputation was done and a 16 kg tumor mass was excised. At three years follow up, the patient has no complains with no recurrence of the tumor."
