  "text": "We observed a 29 y.o. female proband with the episode of venous thrombosis at the age of 18 and family history of thrombosis. The antithrombin level in our patient was low, 44-48% (AT deficiency type I). A new genetic variant c.662G > C (p.W221S) in the SERPINC1 gene was detected in proband and affected father but was absent in healthy sister. We used in silico tools to evaluate the possible impact of p.W221S variant on protein structure and function. In mutated SERPINC1 protein a new N-linked glycosylation site is formed, however, it is unclear if the glycosylation at 219-221 site is possible."
