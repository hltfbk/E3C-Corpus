  "text": "A 32-year-old female patient with Kniest syndrome presented at our department with a painful pseudarthrosis after femoral valgisation osteotomy 8 years ago. A Wagner cone stem and acetabular roof cup with a cemented Ecofit cup 2M (dual-articulation acetabular cup system) were implanted due to a dysplastic femur with a small medullary space. The Ecofit cup itself is associated with a reduced risk of dislocation. The patient was satisfied with the range of motion after hip endoprosthesis and reported a significant increase in quality of life. The patient is still comfortable with the hip prosthesis at the most recent follow-up 4 years after implantation. Follow-up radiographs over 4 years have not revealed any signs of loosening or migration, and no Trendelenburg sign was reported for the affected side."
