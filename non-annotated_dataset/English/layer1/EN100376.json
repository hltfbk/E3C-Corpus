  "text": "We report a case of a male near-term neonate with gestational age of 35 weeks. He was the third born child to a 27-year-old mother with no significant past history. He was derived from a third degree consanguineous marriage. He was born by means of normal vaginal delivery with a normal extra-uterine adaptation. Meconium-stained amniotic fluid was noted. His birth weight was 3030g (75 th Percentile). The baby had normal physical examination at birth aside transitory respiratory distress. He had been hospitalized for four days in a private clinic, for the suspicion of materno-foetal infection, where he had antibiotics for 48 hours. He had developed no symptoms during his hospitalization. The output's weight was 2400g which signify the loss of 630g.\nBack home, he received exclusive maternal breastfeeding. On his fifth day of life, he presented multiple yellowish-watery stools (ab 12 times) and refuse feeding with apyrexia context. He had clinical signs of severe dehydration without fever or vomiting. He lost 930g relative to the birth's weight. The abdomen appeared neither tender nor distended, and the rest of his physical examination was normal. The laboratory findings revealed hypernatremia of 152mEq/L, hyperkalemia of 7,8mEq/L and severe metabolic acidosis: blood PH: 7,1, HCO3:4mEq/L. The osmotic gap was 45. There was no leukocytosis, and the serum level of C-reactive protein was normal. The infant was treated with intravenous fluids and electrolytes as well as antibiotics after obtaining blood and stool cultures, assuming an infectious etiology. After 26 hours of rehydration therapy, the dehydration resolved, however, a functional acute renal failure complicated by acidosis and hyperkalemia appeared. The chest radiograph showed \"bat wings\" pattern and the cardiothoracic index was 0, 45. The renal ultrasound showed discretely hyperechoic kidneys cortex and the absence of renal malformations.\nOn the 11 th day of life, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit. He needed mechanical ventilation for three days and exclusive parenteral feeding by central catheter. The evolution was burdened by cholestasis due to the prolonged parenteral feeding and nosocomial infection by staphylococcus epidermidis. Since his admission, he had developed a slimy diarrhea with 3 to 4 stools per day. He presented a profuse diarrhea during each attempt to introduce enteral feeding by hydrolyzed milk formula. He was discharged after 32 days with output's weight 3250g.\nThe oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and duodenal biopsy showed partial villous atrophy associated to the brush border abnormalities. The periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain revealed abnormalities in the brush border characterized by loss of the linear part of enterocytes with the presence of intra-cytoplasmic PAS + band in the apical pole of enterocytes uneven thickness and sometimes with double contours pattern. In the submucosa, there were numerous Brunner glands. We find the existence of numerous hemorrhagic suffusions. The CD10 immunostain was positive. Thus, a diagnosis hypothesis of MVID was raised. The electron microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis.\nMutation analysis of peripheral blood samples of the neonate revealed a mutation at the homozygous status of MYO5B gene.\nThe baby died, after 97 days of life, of septic shock and multiple organ failure."
