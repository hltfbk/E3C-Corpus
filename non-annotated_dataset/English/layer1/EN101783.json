  "text": "A 46-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia diagnosed 4-months before, as well as new-onset diabetes mellitus unveiled 1-month earlier, was referred to emergency department for hypokalemia. Hormonal study and dynamic biochemical tests performed indicated ECS. Imaging and cytological findings pointed toward a likely primary right parotid malignancy with liver metastases. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy has shown an increased uptake in the parotid gland and mild expression in liver metastasis. The patient underwent right parotidectomy, and histopathologic examination confirmed ACC. Meanwhile, hypercortisolism was managed with metyrapone, ketoconazole, and lanreotide. Despite chemotherapy onset, a rapid disease progression and clinical course deterioration was observed."
