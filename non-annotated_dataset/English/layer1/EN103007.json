  "text": "A 54-year-old female patient was admitted to our surgical department with a 2 mo history of decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss, which progressed to difficulty in feeding 3 d prior to her visit. According to her medical history, she was diagnosed with refractory ITP [platelets (PLT), 3000-8000/Î¼L] 10 years ago. After admission, the patient underwent a splenectomy and a distal subtotal gastrectomy (D2 radical resection) with Roux-en-Y reconstruction simultaneously. She had an uneventful postoperative course with a slight increase in her PLT count. This case is unique in terms of the patient's complication of severe and medically refractory ITP."
