  "text": "A 17 months girl have been consulted in our service for colicky abdominal pain often associated with constipation and loss of appetite, since she was six months old. Parents kept her at home until they remarked visible peristalsis on the abdominal wall, which lead them to consult our service. She was born from a full-term and uncomplicated pregnancy during which the mother had no prenatal ultrasound (US). Her neonatal period was unremarkable. Clinical findings: on physical examination, she was colored and active. Her vitals were within normal limits as well as her anthropometric parameters (weight: 10kg). Her abdomen had moderate distension and peristaltic waves were visible on the abdominal wall. Abdomen was soft on palpation and tympanic on percussion. The digital rectal examination was unremarkable. Symptomatic treatment was initiated with lactulose (five mL bid) and an antispasmodic, trimebutine (five mL bid). Timeline: our patient experienced first symptoms since August 2019. Parents brought her at our service only on 27 th July 2020 two days after they remarked visible peristalsis on her abdominal wall. The patient has been treated and discharged in August 2020 and pathology results were available 11 days later. Diagnostic assessment: blood results were within normal range. Abdominal X-ray showed distension of an intestinal loop in the left lumbar region. Abdominal US identified a misleading colonic dilatation containing heterogeny echoic substance, with no other additional features. Contrast enema was unremarkable. Due to financial constraints, upper gastro-intestinal (GI) series and abdominal computed tomography (CT) could not be performed. An exploratory laparotomy has been indicated with presumptive diagnosis of intestinal duplication. Therapeutic intervention: after the median laparotomy, a dilatated segment of the jejunum was identified at approximately ten cm from the Treitz's angle. Its diameter was fourfold greater than of the adjacent bowel, to which the dilatation was connected abruptly, without any identified obstructive cause. It measured ten cm in length and had prominent serosal vessels. Adjacent mesentery was thickened. No further anatomic anomaly was identified. A resection of the dilatated portion was performed, followed by end-to-end jejunal anastomosis using Vicryl 3/0 in separate stitches. Follow-up and outcomes: microscopic examination revealed a lymphocytic infiltration of both layers of the muscularis propria. The dense lymphocytic infiltration was mainly constituted of T lymphocytes CD3+/8+ (C and D) and some B lymphocytes CD20+. Locally diminished actin coloration indicated atrophy of smooth muscle fibers. Nerve fibers and ganglion cells of myenteric and submucosal plexuses were intact with focalized absence of NK CD56+ cells around lymphocytic infiltration. No ectopic tissue was identified. The postoperative period was uneventful. The patient was on parenteral nutrition until day seven postoperatively. She was discharged on day ten and after three months of monthly follow-up, colicky abdominal pain and chronic constipation had disappeared since the early postoperative days. For the future, the follow-up will be done on a three months basis for a year and then, twice yearly."
