  "text": "A 3 years old boy without any particular diseases history, admitted to the emergency room for a bipolar trauma with a left hemicorporal point of impact following a domestic accident. The delay to consult was 5 hours after the incident.\nThe clinical examination at admission had showed a deformed left superior member, painful on palpation with the presence of the humeral pulse and a right inferior member shortened and flexed, the thigh slightly in adduction, internal rotation with the member.\nA radiological assessment was performed immediately; including a standard X-ray of the pelvis Figure 1 which showed a dislocated head of the right femur, completed secondarily by a CT Scan of the hip confirming the posterior type of the dislocation isolated from any fractures of the head of the femur Figure 2, Figure 3.\nThe standard radiography of the left shoulder showed a Salter I epiphyseal separation of the humerus.\nAfter one hour, we performed an orthopedic reduction of the dislocated hip monitored under scope, with placement of a pelvic splint for an analgesic aim to be kept during three weeks. The radiological results were satisfactory with a restored bilateral symmetry of the articular anatomy Figure 4. The Salter I detachment of the humerus was orthopedically reduced then immobilized by a thoracoabdominal plaster be kept during a month.\nThe child has been discharged the next day. Revised after a month, showed a stable left hip on the clinical examination.\nIn the decline of 2 years, we haven't noticed any recidivism and the functional results were good; On the radiography we do not have any signs of avascular necrosis no changes of the head of femur, of the acetabulum or the joint space Figure 5."
