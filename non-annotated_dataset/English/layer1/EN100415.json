  "text": "A 57 year old lady presented to a peripheral hospital with complaints of penetrating epigastric pain of a week’s duration. There was no vomiting or weight loss. Bowel movements were normal. Clinical examination at the time was unrevealing. An abdominal ultrasound examination was reported as normal. The patient’s insistence on full investigation of the persistent epigastric pain led to a computed tomographic examination and discovery of a pancreatic tumour subsequent to which she was referred to our institution.\nThe CT scan showed a large tumour (6cm in largest diameter) in the body and tail of pancreas with no evidence of metastasis. She was prepared for exploratory laparotomy. The pancreas was explored through the gastrocolic omentum. The body and tail of the pancreas including the tumour were resected. The spleen was also removed. The end of the pancreas was suture ligated. Her post-operative recovery was uneventful. Histological examination of the specimen showed a well circumscribed ovoid tumour 60mm x 50mm across. Sections revealed islands and trabeculae of regular cells with variable amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm, mostly regular nuclei with indistinct nucleoli. Areas of necrosis were present with hemorrhage. A fibrous pseudo-capsule was noted around the tumour and the resection of the tumour appeared complete. No capsular of vascular invasion was seen. Immuno-peroxidase staining was positive for chromogranin A. Synaptophysin was strongly positive, CD10 was negative, Ki-67 was less than 2% positive and the mitotic count was between 2-20 per 10 hpf. The staining reactions were confirmatory of a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the pancreas. The final staging of the completely excised tumour was T3 N0 M0.\nFollowing discharge, she was followed up regularly and remains symptom free. A CT Scan performed 2 years after surgery showed no evidence of tumour recurrence."
