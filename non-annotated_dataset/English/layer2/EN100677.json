  "text": "A 40-year-old Moroccan patient, living in Tangier province, without any medical history. Admitted from a provincial hospital for headache with influenza-like illness plus anosmia evolving for 3 days. The history of its symptoms reveals a recent flu syndrome associated with a loss of smell and cough in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. Patient suspected of a case of COVID-19 is placed under isolation and the PCR and the nasal swab taken. During his isolation he had two episodes of convulsion with vomiting. After stopping the convulsive seizures with medical treatment, he was evacuated in our hospital (Military Hospital of Rabat). Medical examen in our hospital. The interrogation found a progressive decrease in progressive visual acuity. With two episodes of vomiting and partial seizures with recent secondary generalization in a context of influenza like illness. The admission clinic exam; after the barrier measurements and temperature measurement, it is placed in isolation pending the result of the COVID-19 PCR and the sampling of the nasal swab. Secondary after the negative result of the PCR, the second clinical examination founded a conscious patient, Glascow coma scale=15/15, temperature is 37.8 Â°C, and his neck is flexible. Neurogically standing and walking are possible and the examen of muscle strength is normal to the 4 limbs. The osteotendinous reflexes are also normal and the cutaneo plantar reflexes are in bilateral flexion. The examination of the cranial nerves reveals anosmia indicating damage to the first pair of cranial nerves. The visual acuity was preserved in both eyes. The visual field in bed shows an anomaly of the bilateral nasal visual field. The fundus shows grade 1 papillary oedema. Pulmonary auscultation shows fine crackles in the lung bases in a eupneic patient with 98% saturation in ambient air. The rest of the somatic examination is unremarkable, in particular cardiac, digestive and cutaneous. It's a case of anosmia plus secondary epilepsy associated with influenza-like illness in a 40-year-old patient during COVID-19 pandemic. The biological assessment shows a protein reactive C=45 with 11,000 white blood cells with predominance of polynucleosis. The chest X-ray is normal. Then we performed a cerebral CT scan which show a slightly rounded hyper-density process of the extra axial front floor sitting at the olfactory groove area with significant hypo-density peri-lesional oedema on the toe finger more marked on the right and hyper-osterosis in regard of the lesion. Secondary the cerebral MRI scan revelead the presence 4x4x4 cm well enhanced meningioma extra axial mass of the anterior skull base with peri-tumoral oedema corresponding to an olfactory groove meningioma. Patient was prepared and operated. The tumour was totally resected through a left fronto-lateral approach. The postoperative courses were un-eventful with the persistence of totally anosmia."
