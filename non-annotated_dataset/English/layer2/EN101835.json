  "text": "A 27-year-old man visited the emergency department with a self-inflicted abdominal stab wound. Injuries to the colon and ileum were detected, but an injury to the second portion of the duodenum was missed. On the day following admission to our institution, the patient became hemodynamically unstable with massive hematochezia, although there was no evidence of bleeding in the Levin tube or Jackson-Pratt drain. We thus performed an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and discovered a missed duodenal injury that was actively bleeding. An endoscopic band ligation was performed for hemostasis and closure of the perforation. The patient was subsequently discharged without any complications."
