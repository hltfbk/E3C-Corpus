  "text": "A 60-year-old male patient presented to the department of general surgery of PLA Strategic Support Force Characteristic Medical Center with the chief complaint of a mass in the perianal region gradually expanding for more than 30 years and perianal discomfort upon sitting for a preceding period of 2 mo. Physical examination revealed a painless mass in the left perianal region. Contrast-enhanced CT was used for preoperative diagnosis. The patient was treated by total mass excision under epidural anesthesia. Postoperative pathological examination revealed the presence of a perianal epidermoid cyst. The patient showed a satisfactory recovery during the 6-month follow-up period."
