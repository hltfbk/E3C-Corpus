  "text": "We present a case of 29-year-old woman with Epidermolysis bullosa caused by laminin 5 gene mutation. The patient suffered from additional conditions: blindness, complete bilateral sensorineural deafness and oesophageal stenosis. When end stage renal disease was diagnosed, the problem of renal replacement therapy had to be faced. There have been few reports concerning ESRD in this specific group of patients in the available literature. In most of them the prognosis was very poor. Nevertheless, we were very determined to overcome all the difficulties. Special procedures and cooperation with the patient's family allowed us to consider kidney transplantation as a treatment option."
