  "text": "Case 1 : mrs. A was a 27 year old patient in her first pregnancy who was referred at 15 weeks gestation from a physician with a diagnosis of RHD. She had just been diagnosed with severe MS 3 weeks prior to presentation although she had been symptomatic since childhood. An echocardiogram showed mitral valve area (MVA) of 1cm 2, Ejection Fraction (EF) of 59.3% and a moderately dilated left atrium of 55-60mm diameter with no pulmonary hypertension. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) was set up comprising a physician, cardiothoracic surgeon, obstetricians and an anaesthetist. The cardiothoracic surgeon offered open commissurotomy as percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty (PBV) was not available. She declined the in view of the procedure related risks. At 20 weeks gestation she was commenced on propranolol to treat a persistent tachycardia and prophylactic warfarin. She was switched from warfarin to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at 36 weeks gestation. At 38 weeks, an echocardiogram showed an MVA of 0.9cm 2 and EF of 58%. Her functional status was New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II. The estimated foetal weight (EFW) was 1950g, with normal middle cerebral artery (MCA) and umbilical artery (UA) flow. In order to time the required lapse period between last dose of LMWH and the epidural procedure, she had elective induction of labour. She developed foetal bradycardia 6 hours after initiating induction. An emergency caesarean section was done under general anaesthesia as the epidural catheter which had been timed for established labour had not yet been inserted. She was given frusemide and antibiotics peri-partum. A 2020g live baby was delivered. She was discharged from hospital on day 7 on warfarin and was stable when reviewed by both physician and obstetrician 14 days postpartum. She was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit 4 weeks postpartum with shortness of breath, severe supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension and died 3 days later. Case 2 : mrs. B is a 28 years old who presented at 10 weeks gestation. She was known to have RHD and was on warfarin for a mechanical mitral valve. The pregnancy had been planned against advice from her gynaecologist and cardiologist. She was asymptomatic (NYHA class I). She was started on folic acid 5mg daily. Her INR was within therapeutic range. At 20 weeks, a foetal anomaly scan showed severely dilated cerebral ventricles dangling choroid plexus, lemon shaped head. The inter-hemispheric fissure was present and there was no identifiable cortical brain tissue. The facial anatomy was normal. There was a discordant growth pattern with the bi-parietal diameter corresponding to 24 weeks, head circumference to 23 weeks but abdominal circumference and femur length both to 19 weeks. A repeat scan by a radiologist showed \"evidence of a well formed cranium but with severe hydraencephaly with replacement of supratentorial brain parenchyma by cerebro-spinal fluid. There was mild preservation of posterior fossa structures with ventricles not easily describable.\" In the opinion of both the sonographer and the radiologist the findings were not compatible with extra-uterine life. The couple was informed and termination of the pregnancy (TOP) was done. Her INR was 2.3. She expelled the conceptus complete within 24hrs of induction. There was no excessive bleeding and she was discharged in a stable condition. Copper T intrauterine contraceptive device (Cu-IUCD) was offered."
