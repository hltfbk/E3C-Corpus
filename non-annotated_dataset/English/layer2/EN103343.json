  "text": "This case presents a female patient with a complaint of posterior-region pain of her left knee post direct trauma post fall. This was directly followed by knee joint blockage for 1-week duration before presentation to the hospital. On MRI, she was found to have a multiloculated hemosiderin-containing structure of synovial origin within the femoral notch, extending beyond the joint capsule displacing the popliteal vessels. The patient underwent arthroscopic resection of the lesion, which was found to be pigmented villonodular synovitis on anatomopathological examination. On 6-month follow-up, the patient showed good clinical evolution with the absence of symptoms and back-to-normal daily activities."
