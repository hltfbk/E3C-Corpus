  "text": "A 37-year-old woman, gravida 5 para 2, at 38 weeks' gestation was referred to Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) for caesarean delivery. Prior to her referral, she had been scheduled for an elective caesarean section at 38 weeks' gestation due to two previous caesarean sections and a previous abdominal myomectomy. Her antenatal care was essentially uneventful and ultrasonography confirmed a singleton pregnancy. She had nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs collected for RT-PCR test, after close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. She had no symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection and no history of recent travel. However, she complained of abdominal pain and intermittent uterine contractions. She was commenced on oral nifedipine for tocolysis. Her laboratory test confirmed COVID-19 infection after 48 hours and she was referred to LUTH immediately. Although LUTH has assigned wards for the management of patients with COVID-19, there were no dedicated spaces for infected pregnant women and their neonates. However, there was a dedicated operating theatre with a safe corridor to one of the COVID-19 isolation wards. The woman was admitted in a private room at the isolation ward prior to the caesarean section. A multidisciplinary team of obstetricians, anaesthetists, neonatologists, nurses, psychiatrists and infectious disease experts were assembled and simulation sessions were undertaken based on the established infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. All staff caring for the woman wore appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). Her laboratory results were unremarkable except for lymphopenia (a common laboratory finding in patients with COVID-19) [6, 9] and hypokalaemia. The correction of hypokalaemia was commenced with parenteral potassium infusion. She was appropriately counselled and reassured to calm her perioperative anxiety. A remote consent was taken via video call, after sharing appropriate information material via WhatsApp messaging.\nOn admission day 2, she was transported to the operating theatre while observing all the necessary IPC measures. After signing a written informed consent, she had a lower segment caesarean section and bilateral tubal ligation performed under spinal anaesthesia. She was delivered of a full-term male baby weighing 2600g with Apgar score 9 and 10 in 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Intraoperative oxygen saturation was maintained at a minimum of 98%, intraoperative infusion volume was 1000mL and estimated blood loss was 600mL. She had prophylactic intravenous tranexamic acid 1g and carbetocin 100Î¼g. The mother and baby were nursed in the recovery room of the operating theatre and the immediate postnatal period was uneventful. The newborn was commenced on breast milk substitute until the mother was able to breastfeed the baby on demand. On day 3 after delivery, the mother and her newborn were transferred back to the isolation ward. The nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the neonate (at birth and 48 hours after birth) were all negative for COVID-19 infection. Both mother and baby remained asymptomatic during the postpartum period. On day 15 after delivery, the mother met the criteria for discharge because she had remained asymptomatic for more than 14 days after her initial positive result [4]. After appropriate counselling, the mother and her baby were discharged home and scheduled for a follow-up visit in 2 weeks. Throughout the period of care, contact between staff and patient was minimised and she wore a surgical mask all the time. Telephone conversations were frequently used for communication between the woman and the multi-disciplinary team members (obstetrician, anaesthetist, neonatologist and psychiatrist). Fourteen days after the delivery, all her caregivers remained well."
