  "text": "We present here a case of Nijmegen breakage syndrome in an 8-year-old girl born of consanguineous parentage. Her birth histories, her family social history, and developmental milestones were unremarkable. She was born at a local birthing centre, at full term with no antenatal or perinatal complications, attended solely by midwives, she was exclusively breast-fed, food diversification was started at 6 months old, her weight, length and psychomotor development were within the normal range, the child was described as a good eater on a normal diet, and was thriving appropriately. Furthermore, the girl presented recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and sinusitis since 2 years of age, indeed there was history of 5 hospitalizations at a health centre; the last one goes back to the age of 6, then she was sent back to our department for a complete management.\nOn admission, our patient had characteristic facial appearance with a combination of receding forehead, receding mandible and prominent midface, she had also epicanthal folds, large ears, and sparse. In addition, profound microcephaly was noticed (-3SD) that contrasted with normal developmental milestones and good comprehension, while no motor problems and no delayed speech were observed. On the other side, mild growth delay was observed (-2SD on the weight and length) with periorbital squamous lesions. On the basis of this clinical presentation, a tentative diagnosis of Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome had been made; it was confirmed later by genetic analysis.\nBecause of recurrent episodes of respiratory tract infections and susceptibility to develop an immune deficiency further laboratory work-up was notable for increased Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) of 96 mm/h, and combined variable immunodeficiency (lymphocytopenia, T helper cell and B cell count significantly decreased, IGA and IgG4 deficiency).\nIn accordance to this diagnosis and the fact that patients with NBS have a high risk for developing malignancy, predominantly Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) the major cause of death in these individuals, initial radiological exploration showed some multiple lymph nodes (mediastinal, hilar and supraclavicular). Moreover, there was a small mass in the left lung with the splenic nodule Figure 2.\nBiopsy of lymph nodes, pulmonary and splenic nodules had established the diagnosis of nodular sclerosing classical HL while histological examination of the bone marrow showed no infiltration by HL. These findings are consistent with Hodgkin lymphomas Ann Arbor stage IVB. The initial step of management was based on systemic chemotherapy in combination with gamma-globulin replacement therapy every week. Overall, we applied eight cycles of chemotherapy, two of them COP two OEPA, and we were able to escalate full doses of COPDac, in spite of decrease of white blood count that was managed by using granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF). Follow-up MRI was performed at 3, 6, 12 and 18-months after initial diagnosis and continued to show complete remission. At 20-months after the initial diagnosis, the patient does not exhibit any clinical sequelae of the disease."
