  "text": "A 40-year-old married woman (the probands: II3), non-consanguineous, mother of five children. Her family history was remarkable; two of her children were diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia. In 2011, the patient developed a progressive cerebellar ataxia associated with coordination disorder and a significant decrease in visual acuity;In the clinical findings, the patient presented an ataxia, impaired coordination with vivid and diffuse osteotendinous reflexes, a negative Babinski sign and a positive Hoffman's sign. In contrast, muscle tone, deep sensitivity and thermo-pain were normal. The patient did not present hollow feet or scoliosis. The ophthalmologic examination revealed a decrease in visual acuity with significant macular damage and a bilateral optic atrophy. The routine laboratory testing and brain CT and MRI detected isolated pontocerebellar atrophy. The daughter III1 was symptomatic up to 19-years-old, with a progressive ataxia and an ophthalmoplegia. The neurological examination revealed a vivid and diffuse osteotendinous reflexes. Also, the son III2 was symptomatic up to 17 years old with a progressive ataxia, ophtalmoparesia and coordination disorder. The clinical data including spinocerebellar ataxia, maculopathy, optic atrophy and the autosomal dominant inheritance manner have supported the clinical diagnosis of SCA7. All family members included in this report case signed a written informed consent before DNA extraxtion. We conducted Genomic DNA purification from peripheral blood samples in our genetic department in the clinical research center, Mohammed VI University Hospital of Marrakech. We amplified the CAG repeat region in the ATXN7 gene using a fluorescent PCR amplification with primers surrounding the repeated region of interest followed by capillary electrophoresis. The fragments analysis, revealed the presence of a heterozygote allele with pathological expansion of the CAG triplet of the tested locus, which confirmed the diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 in our patient (the probands: II3)."
