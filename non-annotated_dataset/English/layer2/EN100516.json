  "text": "A 9 year old male patient who was apparently well until about 10 months prior to presentation when he was observed to have developed a painless right scrotal swelling. The swelling steadily increased in size and never reduced. He was taken to a peripheral hospital where he was referred to the paediatric surgical unit of a secondary health care facility.\nHe was born in Saki, a community in the south-western region of Nigeria where he grew up till about 3 years ago when he relocated with his family to Lagos metropolis. While in Saki, he often swam in the local river. There was neither history of haematuria in the past nor during the course of the illness.\nExamination revealed a small for age boy with an encysted, irreducible right hemiscrotal mass (10x4.5cm) which was neither tender nor warmer than the surrounding skin and trans-illuminated brilliantly to light. The left testis was unremarkable. A diagnosis of a right vaginal hydrocoele was made and the parent was counseled for surgery.\nPre-operative laboratory investigations revealed a haematocrit level of 35%, HIV status (after obtaining consent from parents) was negative, HBsAg was positive, blood genotype AA, electrolyte, urea and creatinine values were essentially normal.\nHe was subsequently scheduled for a day case routine herniotomy. Intraoperative findings include hydrocoele with multiple cysts, flat testis and thickened spermatic cord. Biopsy was taken from the testis and spermatic cord. He was discharged home on same day.\nHistology revealed fibrocollagenous tissue containing numerous granulomata in a background of dense admixed eosinophilic rich inflammatory infiltrates. Also identified were numerous multinucleated giant cells and schistosoma ova, some of which were calcified with terminal spine. The presence of terminal spine confirmed Schistosoma haematobium and a diagnosis of schistosomiasis was made.\nHe was commenced on praziquantel 400mg stat following the histology report and he is being followed up in the outpatient clinic."
