  "text": "Patient was born as preterm 36WA male baby with body weight of 1700g, during the perinatal period the Newborn presented an intrauterine growth retardation and alteration of cerebral vascularization, indicating a Caesarean Section (C-Section) Birth and Delivery with good adaptation to extra-uterine life. The newborn was admitted in our department at day one of life for prematurity of 36 SA, with intrauterine growth retardation, diffuse jaundice and petechiae were found on face, trunk and limbs with hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory data showed; anaemia Hb 12,2g/dl, leukopenia 8510/µL, platelet was markedly decreased to 18,000/µL, hepatic cytolysis; ALAT 159U/L; ASAT 140U/L; total bilirubin 151mg/l; Direct bilirubin 109mg/l; and biological cholestasis; alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 174; Gamma glutamyltransferase of 252UI/L activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was normal;Prothrombin Time (PT) of 50%. Abdominal ultrasound has noticed hepatosplenomegaly while the Brain CT revealed no calcification or other abnormal findings such as ventricular enlargement. Because of CMV PCR was very positive (54305UI/ml) in the peripheral blood, intravenous ganciclovir administration (15 mg/kg/day) was started and blood transfusion was given for his anaemia. After 4 weeks of treatment, the evolution was marked by a good clinical and biological improvement with regression of jaundice (Direct bilirubin at 47mg/ml; total bilirubin at 63mg/l) and petechiae, betterment of liver function (ALAT 56UI/L; ASAT 83UI/L, platelet count was increased rapidly to normal level (platelet at 165000/µL) while Viral load of CMV was decreased to 572UI/ml. The newbornhas subsequently presented a reappearance of jaundice and petechiae, laboratory data showed: Hb 10g/dl, leukopenia 2750/µL, platelet at 73000/µL, ALAT 91U/L; ASAT 123U/L; total bilirubin 101mg/l; Direct bilirubin 77mg/l, with a rescinding of the viral load (54305UI/ml\\) making suspected a resistanceto ganciclovir or a reactivation of CMV in relation with breastfeedingtherefore we had switched to an oral antiviral drug (valganciclovir 30 mg/kg/day) for fourth week. Unfortunately the newborn died as a result of a lightning hemorrhage \\(Hematemesis, epistaxis, otorrhagia)."
