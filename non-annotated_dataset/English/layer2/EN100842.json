  "text": "A 21 years old male Mexican with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), late presenter; who developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and a disseminated histoplasmosis-related HLS, as part of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). The patient required a long course of corticotherapy, intravenous immunoglobulin and massive transfusions (more than 10 units in 24 h, and a total of 83 units), besides amphotericin-B and ganciclovir treatment. An academic research institute of immunology aided in the accurate diagnosis of HLS with the implementation of tests not available within the hospital, thus improving the care provided to the patient. The patient recovered, was discharged, and continue to improve."
