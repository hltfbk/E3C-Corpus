  "text": "Case Presentation 1: A 4 year-old right-hand dominant girl sustained a hyper-extension injury to her right thumb while on holiday abroad. She was told she has \"sprained\" her thumb. On review in fracture clinic 10 days later, the MCPJ of her thumb remained swollen and bruised. Radiographs showed a dorsally dislocated MCPJ of the right thumb. Case Presentation 2: A four-year old right-hand dominant boy presented to fracture clinic after being referred from A&E with a left 'thumb injury' - his thumb had accidentally been jammed in a door 1 week previously. Radiographs were reviewed and repeated, confirming a MCPJ dislocation."
