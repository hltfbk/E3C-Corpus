  "text": "A 53-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of dull progressive lower abdominal pain radiating to the upper abdomen and back. The patient reported fevers and shivering. She had a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome, depression and had an open appendicectomy at the age of 17. On examination, the patient had a fever at 38 o C and a heart rate of 92/min. Her abdomen was tender throughout, markedly in the right upper quadrant. Blood tests showed leukocytosis at 14.8 10 9 /L (Normal value: 4-11 10 9 /L), high c-reactive protein at 253mg/L (Normal value: 0-5mg/L) with normal amylase level at 18U/L (Normal value: 30-118U/L). A computed tomography (CT) scan done on admission, showed an ingested FB perforating through the pylorus, embedded in the liver with adjacent mesenteric stranding and a 5.6cm loculated liver abscess transgressing segments III/IVb. It then transpired that the patient had inadvertently swallowed a fishbone approximately one week prior to presentation. The abscess was not amenable to drainage owing to its multilocularity. Hence, she was managed conservatively as an inpatient with a month's therapy of intravenous antibiotics and received piperacillin tazobactam 4.5grams four times daily and metronidazole 500mgs three times daily. In addition, total parenteral nutrition was started, whilst the patient was nil by mouth. Following satisfactory clinical and radiological improvement the patient was discharged home with outpatient follow-up. Six weeks follow up CT scan demonstrated replacement of the complex liver abscess with a small focus of low attenuation change on either side of the falciform ligament and the linear foreign body extending from the pyloric wall into segment four of the liver remained unchanged in position. On her annual follow up, the patient reported being completely asymptomatic. An ultrasound scan (US) confirmed complete resolution of the abscess, but the fishbone was still visible. She was discharged from routine follow-up."
