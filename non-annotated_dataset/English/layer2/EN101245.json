  "text": "A 37-year-old patient was admitted to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain. Following explorative laparoscopy, locally advanced diffuse gastric cancer was diagnosed. The indication for genetic testing of CDH1 was given due to the patient's young age. A germline mutation in CDH1 was identified in the index patient. As a result, several family members underwent genetic testing. The patient's father, brother and one aunt were identified as carriers of the familial CDH1 mutation and subsequently received gastrectomy. In both the father and the aunt, histology of the surgical specimen revealed a diffuse growing adenocarcinoma after an unremarkable preoperative gastroscopy."
