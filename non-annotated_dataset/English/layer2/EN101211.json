  "text": "A 30-year-old male presented with a right pneumo-haemothorax due to active bleeding revealed at contrast-enhanced CT, as a consequence of a fall occurred in the previous week. The patient was treated with endovascular embolisation in an angiographic room with coils placement, since the right thyrocervical artery was found to be supplying the pneumo-haemothorax. A radiculo-medullary branch rose from the thyrocervical trunk, impeding the proximal embolization with microparticles and needing selective isolation of the bleeding artery with the catheter to avoid spinal cord injuries. The treatment had a successful result and the following CT control showed signs of recovering, without any complication."
