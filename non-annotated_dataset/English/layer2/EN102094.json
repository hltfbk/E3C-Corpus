  "text": "A 78-year-old man with squamous cell lung carcinoma in IPF underwent second-line treatment with pembrolizumab. He was diagnosed as having pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis after two cycles. He was administered prednisolone (PSL) and then improved immediately. Thereafter, his lung cancer lesion enlarged despite treatment with TS-1. Atezolizumab was then administered as 4th-line chemotherapy, but he immediately developed atezolizumab-induced pneumonitis after 1 cycle. The re-escalated dosage of PSL improved the pneumonitis, and then nintedanib was started as additional therapy. Under careful observation with nintedanib, atezolizumab was re-administered on day 1 of an every-21-day cycle. After three cycles, it remained stable without exacerbation of drug-induced pneumonitis."
