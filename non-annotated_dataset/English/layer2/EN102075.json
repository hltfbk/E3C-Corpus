  "text": "A 43-year-old woman was referred with complaints of deteriorating dyspnea and orthopnea. Chest computed tomography revealed right massive pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. Echocardiography demonstrated collapse of both the right atrium and right ventricle due to cardiac tamponade. Semi-rigid thoracoscopic pleural biopsy and pericardio-pleural fenestration were successfully performed under local anesthesia via a single trocar, because surgical procedures under general anesthesia with single-lung ventilation might have been intolerable for the patient. Adequate biopsy specimens of pleura and pericardium and immediate relief of serious symptoms were obtained without perioperative complications. No recurrence of pleural or pericardial effusion was observed for 3â€‰months postoperatively."
