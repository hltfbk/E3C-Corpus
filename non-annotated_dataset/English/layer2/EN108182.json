  "text": "48-year-old Turkish female presented to the department with fever, weakness and pain in the bilateral pelvic region. In contrast abdominal magnetic resonance, a collection compatible with the hyperintense abscess was observed in the right and left ilipsoas muscles. It was decided to simultaneously drain both abscesses of the case who had been using oral and intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics for two months. No factors were detected in the microbiological reviews made on the abscess fluid of the operated case. The case was also examined in terms of tuberculosis and Crohn's disease and no findings were encountered to rise suspicions of such diseases."
