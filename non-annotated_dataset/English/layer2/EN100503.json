  "text": "A male child aged three years was referred to our hospital from a rural health facility. He had been initiated on empiric anti-tuberculous therapy with no clinical improvement after three months of treatment. The patient had been in good health until six months prior when he developed cough and intermittent fever. He was admitted with a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia for which unspecified antibiotic therapy was given with transient improvement. Similar symptoms recurred two months later and he was readmitted. A chest radiograph showed right upper lobe consolidation with volume loss, right para-tracheal and left hilar adenopathy and bilateral fine reticulonodular opacification. A Gene ®Xpert™(MTB/RIF) performed on fasting gastric aspirates was negative. A clinical diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was made based on the algorithm for diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis [1] and standard anti-tuberculous therapy (2HRZE/4HR) was initiated. His condition continued to deteriorate; he developed a mass on the right upper chest wall and was referred to our facility three months into tuberculosis (TB) treatment, for evaluation of suspected malignancy. At presentation, he had persistent fever and cough with dyspnea that disrupted feeding. The cough was scantily productive of white sputum. Progressive swelling had been noted on the right chest wall and there was marked weight loss. There was no recent travel history. There had been no contact with domestic livestock or birds nor with any person with tuberculosis. He was HIV negative. At presentation, temperature was 39.4°C, respiratory rate 40/min, pulse rate 125/min, blood pressure 100/70 mmhg, spO2 88%. He had no conjunctival pallor or jaundice. He had multiple enlarged discrete right axillary lymph nodes, largest 2cm in diameter; firm, non-tender and mobile. He had a firm, tender, diffuse swelling on the right upper chest wall with fluctuant areas, that over subsequent days developed draining sinuses with no discharging granules. He was tachypnoeic with dullness to percussion and bronchial breathing in the right upper zones posteriorly. The rest of the systemic examination was normal. Serial results of laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Blood cultures and pus swab cultures of the draining sinuses showed no growth. β D Glucan and galactomannan assays were not available. Chest radiographs taken on admission showed no improvement when compared to previous films. Contrast enhanced CT Scan of the chest was done with images as shown. An ultrasound guided fine needle core biopsy of the chest wall mass was carried out. Histology revealed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with pieces of acutely branching hyphae morphologically consistent with Aspergillus sp. These were also demonstrated on Periodic Acid Schiff stained sections. Genomic testing and fungal culture were not performed. On admission the patient had been empirically started on ceftriaxone and vancomycin therapy; when the histology was received, treatment with amphotericin B was initiated and the patient was scheduled for surgical debridement and lobectomy. He developed respiratory failure and succumbed on the second day of treatment. The next of kin did not consent for an autopsy."
