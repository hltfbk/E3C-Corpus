  "text": "A 72-year-old woman was consulted to the Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospotal, Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, with a chief complaint of blackish red spots on the posterior trunk since one day before admission. The initial lesion was unknown. Complaints of itching is unknown due to patient's decreased of consciousness state. The patient had a long history of immobilize for 14 days. History of similar complaint from the family was denied. History of diabetes mellitus was absent. Patient had a history of syphilis with HIV infection and got therapy of intramuscular injection 2.4 million unit of benzathine penicillin G for three consecutive weeks. He was also treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) with tenofovir 300mg, lamivudine 300mg, and efavirenz 600mg. Physical examination showed blood pressure of 100/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 beats per minute, and temperature 36.5°C. Laboratory blood tests were within normal limits. Neurologic examination showed decreased awareness and lateralization of both sides. Dermatological examination of the posterior trunk region found hyperpigmented macules accompanied by crust, squama and erythematous macules. Based on the history taking and physical examination, the patient was diagnosed with sepsis, suspected meningoencephalitis, hypoalbuminemia, community-acquired pneumonia, and cutaneous candidiasis. The patient was given citicoline 500mg/12 hours/IV, omeprazole 40mg/12 hours/IV, ceftriaxone 2gr/12 hours/IV, vancomycin 1gr/12 hours/IV, vitamin B complex 1gr/24 hours/intravenously, acetazolamide 250mg/12 hours/nasogastric tube, and paracetamol 1gr/8 hours/intravenously. Topical fusidic acid cream was also applied on ulcerative lesions to avoid bacterial superinfection. For the cutaneous candidiasis, patient was treated with miconazole cream twice daily in the morning and evening and fusidic acid cream for 14 days. Direct microscopic examination using 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) and culture were done to for further investigation on the causative agent. Direct microscopic of the skin scrapings on the back using 10% KOH showed clustered spores and pseudohyphae. Culture in Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) media added with chloramphenicol incubated at 25°-30°C showed mucoid brownish white colonies with smooth surfaces on the third day, typical of the fungus Candida sp. One week later, gram staining was carried out and positive purple color mildews were obtained. There were yeast cells and budding spores which were consistent with candida species. Further examination was carried out using carbohydrate fermentation to determine the type of candida which showed a change in color from purple to orange in glucose, sucrose, and lactose and gas formed in each of the reagents. The findings from carbohydrate fermentation test supported Candida kefyr as the causative agent (Table 1). Data from the history taking, physical examination, and supporting examinations concluded a diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis caused by Candida kefyr. On the fifth day of treatment the lesion showed marked improvement. Fusidic acid was dropped and only miconazole was continued. The patient was eventually discharged from the neurology department on the sixth day."
