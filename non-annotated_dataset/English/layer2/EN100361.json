  "text": "We present a rare case of a middle aged female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis under non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which is currently in remission. Since 2 months, she describes inflammatory lower back pain without a preceding trauma. She denied nausea, vomiting, hematochezia, melena or weight loss. His family history was negative for any malignancies. On examination the patient had fever 39Â°C, pain in the pressure of the thorny of dorsal and lumbar vertebrae. She had normal strength and sensation in the lower extremities and denied any fecal or urinary incontinence. However, reflexes were increased with positive Babinski at the left side. Investigations showed Hb of 7, 2 g/dl, WBC count 8600/mm 3, hyper eosinophilia of 1100/mm 3, platelets 80,000/mm 3, sedimentation rate 135/mm 3, C-reactive protein 81 mg/l, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 466 U/l (reference range 35-140 IU/L), Calcium and prothrombin time 80% of normal. Renal function was normal. We noted a cholestasis (2 x ULN) with a normal rate of bilirubine. X ray of the spine revealed several lytic lesions throughout most of his spine which initially raised suspicion of metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed secondary lesions in the spine and pelvis. Bone scintigraphy revealed abnormal uptake in the spine (T5, T9 and T11), ribs and in sacro iliac joint. The patient was then investigated to look for the primary. Echo mammography was normal. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed multiples hepatic metastasis. Uppergasrointestinal endoscopy was done and revealed a small 2 cm ulcerated mass at the antrum which was not visualized on the CT scan. A biopsy indicated an adenocarcinoma moderately differentiated and infiltrating of the stomach. The patient underwent chemotherapy with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil along with radiation Figure 1."
