  "text": "The patient underwent hysteroscopic surgery, which successfully resolved the isthmocele as well as the hydrometra. Afterward, two high-quality, euploid embryos, determined by morphological assessment and pre-implantation genetic diagnostic testing, were transferred. This resulted in uterine pregnancy, as determined by serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin levels on day 14 (180 mU/mL) and ultrasound-confirmed presence of a gestational sac with a positive embryocardia at week 6. The pregnancy reached 36 wk without any complications, and the product was born in good health. We report a successful isthmocele treatment in a patient with secondary infertility, in which the isthmocele was the cause of persistent hydrometra."
