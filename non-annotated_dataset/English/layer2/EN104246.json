  "text": "We have included five cases which were diagnosed in our department as we believe that publication of these new cases is relevant for the improved understanding of these specific tumors. Four of our five patients were males, mean age was 24 years. There was wide variation in the location of these tumors. Mean size of excised tumors was 5.5 cms in the greatest dimensions. Three out of five cases represented hybrid schwannoma/perineurioma histologically. No significant nuclear atypia, mitotic activity or necrosis seen. All five cases were completely excised. All five patients are alive and well at the time of writing with no recurrence."
