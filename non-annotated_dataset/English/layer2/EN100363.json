  "text": "67-year-old woman with one year history of intermittant headache, which was prominent in the left periorbital region, was first evaluated in another hospital and found to have normal Brain CT and MRI scan. She was recommended analgesic and antidepressant treatment. 2 months before admission to our clinic, the headache worsened, became continuous and finally medial deviation of the left eye appeared. This time she was suffering from diplopia. Neurological examination was normal except left abducens palsy. The medical and family history was unremarkable. A comprehensive blood survey (including ESR, CRP, hemogram, serum biochemistry, TFT, vitamin B12, folate and ASO levels) was normal; vasculitic and tumour markers were negative. Transthoracic echocardiogram was normal. An orbita MRI and MR venogram were performed for exclusion of Tolosa Hunt Syndrome; brain MRI was repeated. Orbita MRI and\nMR venogram were normal. Asymmetric enlargement of the left cavernous sinus and contiguous tubular signal-void regions were detected on the brain MRI. There was asymmetric dural enhancement on the anterior part of the temporal pole, on the middle cranial fossa. Cranial arterial MR angiography (TOF) showed enlargement of cavernous sinuses, more prominent on the left side and homogenous enhancement after contrast administration. The left ophtalmic artery and left superior ophtalmic vein were increased in caliber when compared to the right side.\nSince the findings were not enough to make definite diagnosis, DSA was performed, which revealed the presence of early venous drainage to the cavernous sinuses both from external carotid arteries and cavernous segments of the internal carotid arteries. The venous drainage was predominantly supplied by superior ophthalmic and angular veins. The lesion was angiographically classified as bilateral type D dural arteriovenous fistula of cavernous sinuses. Neurosurgery, Interventional Radiology and Neurology Departments agreed on endovascular embolization therapy. The patient was informed about the management but she disapproved the treatment and was discharged."
