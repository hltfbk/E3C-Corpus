  "text": "A 45-year-old Caucasian male patient was referred to our clinic of endocrinology, because of an incidental finding in a CT scan, suggestive of paraganglioma, performed in the work up for abdominal pain. The abdominal CT scan revealed a 4cm nonspecific retroperitoneal, paraaortic lesion, between celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery, suggestive of neuroendocrine tumor as the first possibility. He had a past medical history of smoking, Barret's esophagus, hiatus hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease treated with omeprazole. He had undergone a sleeve gastrectomy as a surgical weight loss procedure in 2015 and cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis in 2017. After the first visit in our clinic, an initial laboratory investigation was performed for the suspected paraganglioma (references values in parenthesis): glucose 79 mg/dl (74-106); creatinine 0.69 mg/dl (0.70-1.30); alanine aminotransferase 22 IU/L (10-49); ferritin 73 ng/ml (22-322); enolase 19 ng/ml (< 16); carcinoembryonic antigen 2.6 ng/ml (< 5.0); Ca 19.9: 12 IU/ml (< 37); chromogranin A: 3.3 nmol/l (0.4-10.0); hemoglobin 15.4 gr/dl (13.5-17.5); neutrophils 51.7% (40.0-70.0); lymphocytes 33.4% (22.0-44.0), eosinophils 5.3% (RV < 8.0). Moreover, total and fractional catecholamines, total metanephrines and excretion of 5-OH-indolacetic in the 24-hour urine analysis were normal. Next, radioisotope imaging was ordered. The whole-body scintigraphy with metaiodobenzylguanidine didn't reveal any clear signs suggesting the existence of catecholamine-producing tumor. The whole-body (99m) Tc-octreotide scintigraphy with SPECT/CT showed a paraaortic abdominal mass, but without evidence of pathological tumor uptake. After multidisciplinary discussion, it was decided to perform a CT-guided biopsy of the lesion. Microscopic study of the sample demonstrated no atypia but a tissue with fibrosis, collagenization and presence of spongy-looking structures, suggestive of microorganisms. Unfortunately, no microbiological cultures of the biopsy were done. The patient then was referred to the department of infectious disease for further evaluation. During the focused anamnesis, the patient reported having recently made several business travels to Africa, Central America, South America and the Caribbean. He had no weight loss, fever, diarrhea, or skin lesions and there were no significant findings on physical examination. A Mantoux test was performed which was negative. The following serological studies were carried out: hepatitis A virus; Epstein-Barr virus; Trypanosoma cruzi ; cytomegalovirus; Ac HBs; Ag HBs; Ac HBc T; HIV 1 + 2; Toxoplasma gondii ; Entamoeba histolytica ; Echinococcus granulosus ; Taenia solium (IgG); Leishmania spp.; strongyloides and schistosoma. All results were negative and do not showed acute infection, except schistosoma with IgM and IgG positive. Based on the results obtained in the serological tests, a schistosoma infestation (schistosomiasis) was diagnosed and praziquantel was prescribed. During the follow-up the patient referred remission of the abdominal pain and a CT control one year later showed a shrink in size of the paraaortic lesion."
