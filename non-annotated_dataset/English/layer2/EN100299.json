  "text": "A 45-year-old women with SSc was referred to the unit of orofacial pain and temporomandibular dysfunction of the university medical dental clinic of Monastir, Tunisia, with a progressive limited mouth opening and facial pain since 2 years. A history of pain in the right and left pre-auricular regions and masticatory myalgia more pronounced in masseter muscles with a morning stiffness of jaws was depicted. These symptoms are aggravated by function. A sounds in the right TMJ were also reported. She had no history of trauma or infection of the TMJ. The patient had a medical history of limited cutanous systemic sclerosis diagnosed by an internal medicine specialist since 3 years and treated by methotrexate, colchicine, amlodipine, methylprednisolone, cholecalciferol, sulodexide, acidumfolicum and Lysinacetylsalicylas. The TMJ and muscle symptoms was noted since 1 year after her diagnosis. These symptoms have slowly worsened prompting the patient to run our specializing consultation. Physical examination of the patient revealed that SSc affected mainly her hands with a fingers movementlimitation, associated with sclerodactyly complicated by digital ulcers, moderate lung fibrosis with a flexion contracture and a claw-like deformity.\nThe clinical examination of the orofacial region revealed a masklike facies with a smooth and tight facial skin with a loss of normal animation lines and a bilateral stiffness in masticatory muscles at palpation and movements. The mouth opening was limited to 23 mm and the mandible deviated to the right side. The other mandibular movements such as propulsion and deductionare also restricted. The palpation of TMJ region causes severe pain more pronounced in the right side and a restricted condylar movement. No joint sounds and no malocclusion are depicted Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in open-and closed-mouth positions, was performed to evaluate the TMJ and to check an eventual masticatory muscles fibrosis. The MRI showed internal derangement of TMJ, bilateral mandibular condylar process resorption, and disk deformations with heterogeneous appearance. The bilateral mandibular condylar process containssubchondral geodes and thinned cortical on sagittal and coronal views of MRI and hypomobility in open mouth. There was no fibrosis in masticatory muscles. The diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) with arthralgia and myalgia related to SSc was made. The patient was treated by an association of conservative techniques including rest, reassurance and jaw-opening exercises for painful joint. A myorelaxant was prescribed for 10 days to managing myofascial pain and aphysical therapy was indicated for 6 months including massage treatment on the bilateral masseter and temporal muscles, exercises, ultrasound, for improve jaw movements, managing musculoskeletal and myofacial pain.The patient was regularly reviewed monthly to evaluate pain and jaw movements. A great improvement in TMD symptoms was reported. After 2 months of physical therapy, the mouth opening increased from 23 to 33 mm and a reduction in muscle pain was noted. The preauricular and muscle pain was gradually disappeared. The muscle flexibility has been partially improved by physiotherapy. However, a certain rigidity in the area of masseter muscles is still, due to its SSc and skin fibrosis. A relaxant nocturnal occlusal appliance was indicated to stabilize the resultsand was very supported by the patient."
