  "text": "An 83-year-old man with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, overt cardiovascular disease, a 10 months history of stage III chronic kidney disease and haematuria was referred to our hospital for dyspnoea, atypical chest pain and persistent light-headedness. The patient experienced a syncopal episode after a strenuous effort. Physical examination revealed a stable hemodynamic status, a pulsus parvus and an increased intensity of pulmonic component of the second heart sound. Electrocardiography revealed no abnormalities except for a low QRS voltage in limb leads. Laboratory findings highlighted a normocytic normochromic regenerative anaemia, thrombocytopenia and noted high levels of CA19-9. The transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) readily showed two distinct masses occupying the right ventricle outflow tract measuring respectively 15 x 9 mm and 14 x 7 mm, and a large well-defined mass (22 x 33mm) in the right atrium attached to the inter atrial septum, a subcostal view revealed that the mass seemed to originate from the inferior vena cava (IVC), hence suggestive of a thrombus. Computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen were undergone to rule out any primary malignancy. It consistently showed that the mass is extending from the IVC to the right atrium, along with another mass situated in the right ventricle, without evidence of pulmonary embolism. Moreover, we noted a dilation of the right urinary tract associated to ureteral wall thickening highly suggestive of a tumour, considering the history of haematuria and the presence of malignant cells in urine samples. In light of this, anticoagulation with intravenous unfractionated heparin was initiated with echocardiographic follow-up. The patient didn't experience haematuria or any external bleeding in the following days. Yet, after six days of heparin therapy, the patient presented acute respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability refractory to intensive medical care. The patient died shortly after."
