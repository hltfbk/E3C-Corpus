  "text": "Analytical cross sectional research design was used. Study variables were hospital equipment, hospital infrastructure, the surrounding hospital environment, training, drills, staff knowledge and staff capability. The hypothesis in this study was ‘Mean score capacity does not differ significantly between Public and Private Hospitals in Nairobi County, Kenya‘. The study setting was hospitals in Nairobi County, Kenya. 32 hospitals cooperated during the research, 9 of them public and 23 private hospitals. Study respondents were the hospital workforce categorised as either clinical or administrative staffs. Clinical staffs comprised those whose primary responsibility was to save lives and doctors and nurses were the main respondents. Administrative staff comprised those responsible for coordinating the HS processes within the hospitals. They comprised; the Chief Medical Officer, Financial Controller, the Disaster Management Committee Chair, the Communications Department Chair and the Human Resources Director. Based on information by Ndetei, Khasakhala and Omolo, [5], the number of administrative and clinical staffs in Nairobi County was obtained to be 18707. Slovin's formula for random sampling [6] was used to get the representative sample at 95% level of confidence. The estimated sample size obtained was 391.6 and this was adjusted to 400. Upon field work, 263 respondents participated which was 65. 7 5% participation. Research instruments were questionnaires, participant observation checklist and key informant interviews. Ethical consideration was obtained from the National Council of Science and Technology, Kenya and the hospital ethical committees. A confidentiality clause was also included on the questionnaire form. Field work was executed between the months of June to August 2012. Research assistants took time to fill the observers' checklist and used the key informant interview form to interview administrative staff. Questionnaires were self administered on the clinical staff. Statistical significance was considered at p value < 0.05. Data obtained after fieldwork was filtered, coded and keyed into Statistical Packages for Social Scientists (SPSS) version 10. A detailed description of study results obtained is tabulated in."
