  "text": "A 66-year-old female patient known case of hypertension and diabetic mellitus presented to our institute with palpable mass in the left breast associated with pain of long duration. There was no nipple discharge, or fever. No history of breast trauma, hormone replacement therapy, or family history of breast cancer. On physical examination, large palpable mass is identified within the left breast with regular borders. The nipple, areola, and skin are unremarkable. There was no palpable lymph node in the left axilla. The right breast and axilla were normal and systemic examination did not show any abnormality. Investigations showed normal complete blood count, and chemistry apart from raised serum glucose level. Liver function test is within normal limits. Chest x-ray is grossly unremarkable. On her mammograms, large oval and dense mass is identified within upper outer quadrant of the left breast. The mass is multilobulated and well circumscribed in its contours. It measures about 9.2x7.5 cm. There was no associated microcalcifications. The nipple-areola and skin complex are grossly unremarkable. No significant enlarged axillary lymph nodes are seen. The right breast is within normal limits. Our impression based on the mammograms is unusual large dense mass of the left breast coded as BIRAD 4A taking into consideration the patient age for further evaluation by target ultrasound. The differential diagnosis would include phyllodes tumor, PASH (Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia), and well circumscribed carcinoma. Ultrasound was performed in same sitting for further characterization using Philips IU22 ultrasound machine. The ultrasound revealed a large heterogeneous and lobulated mass seen in the left breast upper outer quadrant corresponding to the mammographic density. Few internal anechoic cysts are seen at the peripheral aspect of the lesion. Doppler interrogated images were also obtained which revealed no internal vascularity within the mass. There was no associated enlarged axillary lymph nodes. Plan was made for histological confirmation by biopsy. The procedure risks, and benefits were completely explained to the patient. Procedure consent form was obtained from the patient. Ultrasound guided core needle biopsy was performed. The specimen was sent to the pathology department for analysis. The procedure was uneventful. No complications were reported. CT scan was performed for further assessment which showed a large oval hypodense mass in the left breast. Very tiny and thin internal septations were also evident. Peripheral enhancement was seen. No internal enhancement within the mass was identified. The mass measured about 6.8x6.2x9 cm in maximum dimensions. No axillary lymph nodes were noted. The rest of intra thoracic and abdominal structures were within normal limits. The pathology report revealed scanty material formed of fragmented eosinophilic membranes with laminated appearance in keeping with hydatid cyst. The final diagnosis was made to be hydatid cyst of the breast. The patient was referred to the surgery department for surgical resection."
