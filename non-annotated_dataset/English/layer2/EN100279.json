  "text": "We report a case of 38 year old, housewife without past medical history. There was no history of steroid usage, alcohol drinking, or trauma. She presented in 2009, during the third trimester of pregnancy, mechanical pain in the left hip, persistent postpartum, causing walking discomfort. Blood analysis was normal in postpartum, and radiographs showed the femoral head subtle loss of sphericity. T2-weighted sequence MRI of the femoral heads showed bilateral joint effusion with focal lesion at the anterior part of the left hip. Symptomatic treatment was introduced to avoid complications and elective caesarean section was indicated.\nBy the way, she consulted five years ago in our department for the same but bilateral symptoms, and pain became more severe at left without extra-articular sign. Physical examination revealed a walking limp, weight at 65 kg, and 167.5 cm for size. There was a pain in left hip flexion with limitation at 100 degrees. Key sign was positive with positive Patrick's (flexion abduction external rotation) tests especially at left hip. Radiographs showed prominent osteoarthritis, which is espacially at right, with collapse of the articular surface and minimal loss of sphericity at the left femoral head, compared to the radio after pregnancy.\nLaboratory tests were normal (ESR at 26 mm/first hour, Rhumatoid Factor and antinuclear antibodies were negative, Hemoglobin electrophoresis showed; A1 at 97 and A2 at 3, antiphospholipid antibodies were negative, and normal lipidic analysis). There wasn't any abdominal ultrasound abnormalies.\nRetained diagnosis was aseptic osteonecrosis of the left femoral head and secondary osteoarthritis at right by hyperpression. Core decompression surgical treatment was suggested, but the patient wished to receive medical treatment only to date (symptomatic treatment, oral bisphosphonate), associeted to shockwaves. The outcome marked clinical improvement (walk without limping and pain), the radiographs are expected six months after starting treatment."
