  "text": "A 2.5 year-old girl applied to our clinic with the complaints of abasia and deformity in knees and feet. She was the third child of a diabetic mother according to her medical history and consanguineous marriage was not the case for her parents. It was understood during the antenatal follow-up that the diagnosis has been made during 28th-gestational week and caesarean delivery has been performed at 34th-gestational week. There were no history of drug use, radiation exposure and serious disease for the mother, for whom the blood glucose has not been regulated during pregnancy. It was ascertained that there were no similar congenital deformities in other family members including the healthy siblings of patient. In locomotor system examination, lower extremities of patient were hypoplasic and there were no activity in all key muscles of lower extremities including quadriceps. Her hips were in flexion and abduction position when patient was in supine position but there were no contracture. Flexion contracture of 75 degree accompanied by popliteal web was observed in the knees of patient. Equinovarus deformity has been observed in both feet. Hypoplasia of the labia majora has been determined in genital area. No deformities were detected in upper extremities, but she had frog abdomen due to weakness of the abdominal muscles. Other system examinations were normal. Total sacral agenesis and partial lumbar vertebrae agenesis were observed in voiding cystourethrography performed due to repeated urinary tract infections and spinal cord was observed to be terminated at T6 vertebral corpus level according to lumbar MRI. Vertebrae were observed to the T10 vertebra level and lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae and sacrum couldn't be observed. Tethered cord and other anomalies of vertebrae such as hemivertebrae were not detected in patient. In the urinary ultrasonography, horseshoe kidney with the fusion abnormality of both kidneys at lower pole and bilateral grade 2 hydronephrosis were observed. In the urodynamic evaluation, detrusor overactivity and grade 2 vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) were determined consistent with the neurogenic bladder. It was understood that the patient has been administered with clean intermittent catheterization with the urologic follow-up. Cervical MRI and transfontanelle USG results of the patient were normal and result of cytogenetic analysis was 46,XX normal female karyotype. Deformities of lower extremities were considered for surgery by consulting to orthopaedics department. However, the surgery was not found to be appropriate as the flexion contractures in the knees considered to help the sitting stability of the patient having no ambulation potential due to spinal-pelvic instability. Family has been informed on prognosis and treatment options, upper extremity strengthening exercises, good skin care and positioning, and follow-up procedures have been initiated for patient."
