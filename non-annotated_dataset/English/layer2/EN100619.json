  "text": "LA is an 8-year-old who had an open trauma of the left elbow with pus 15 days before he consulted the pediatric emergency department for a generalized scarlatiniform erythema evolving towards flaking with a fever of 39 o C. Clinical examination has found a drowsy child, tachycardia at 130 beats per minute, polypnea at 44 cycles per minute, hypotension at 90/56mmHg with an extended capillary refill time (CRT) which required his admission to intensive care initially. The biological assessment had shown an inflammatory syndrome: C reactive protein (CRP) at 175.85mg/L; to the blood count: leukocytosis at 37.270g/L with a neutrophil predominance at 26.540g/L, thrombocytopenia at 83g/L and a lymphocyte count at 4.83G/L. The blood ionogram identified hyponatremia at 122mmol/L, hypokalemia at 3.4mmol/L and hypo-albuminemia at 23.4g/L. Two blood cultures were performed with isolation of a methicillin-sensitive coagulase negative staphylococcus A. The patient received amoxicillin-clavulanic acid intravenously for 21 days combined with gentamycin for 48 hours. The evolution a week later was marked by the appearance of a painful inflammatory swelling associated with spasticity of both arms and legs with functional impotence of the two lower limbs and a walk on tiptoes. The patient was transferred to our department after a stay in intensive care for etiological assessment. An X-ray of the pelvis and both elbows were done which were found to be normal with a creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level at 37IU/L. An ultrasound of 4 limbs was performed objectifying abscesses of soft tissues, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the two legs revealed the presence of multiple multiloculated formations with T2 hyperintense signal on the posterior and the right antero-external compartment of both legs measuring for the largest 200 X 9 X 8mm, associated with T2 hyperintense signal and edematous calcaneus on short-TI inversion recovery (STIR) images suggesting bilateral pyomyositis. Indeed, the delay between first signs and diagnosis was 2 months. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was started with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for 4 weeks then 15 days orally, for a total duration of 6 weeks, associated with motor physiotherapy. The patient had after 20 days of evolution a drainage of abscesses by the team of orthopedic surgeons of our university hospital, however, the puncture was white; complemented by an incision which did not objectify pus with a sterile bacteriological study. Fever disappeared after 72 hours; the child gradually resumed walking during his hospitalization with a complete regression of the symptomatology after 6 weeks. Regarding the search for an underlying cause, the HIV serology was negative, the fasting blood sugar was 0.92g/dL, the lactate - ammonia level were normal and the dihydrorhodamine 123 test (DHR) for a Chronic septic granulomatosis was normal. However, the assessment of immunoglobulins, lymphocyte subpopulations and vaccine antibodies was not carried out."
